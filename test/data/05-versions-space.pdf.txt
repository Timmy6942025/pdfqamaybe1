Why God Gave Us the Bible
B
efore studying God’s Word, we must understand why God gave it 
to us. It is possible to study the Bible for the wrong reasons – and I 
think a lot of Christians do just that. We must study the Scriptures 
for the same purpose that God gave it. 
When I was considering this study through the whole Bible, and was 
trying to look into the heart of God, the verse that came to my mind was: 
“God so loved the world that He gave His Son, that whoever believes 
in  Him  should  never  perish.” (John  3:16).  The  primary  purpose  with  
which God gave us the Scriptures was that all people might know that He 
loves them so intensely that He sent His Son to save them from the grip 
of sin and bring them into fellowship with Him. In God’s heart there is a 
great desire that no one should be ruined by sin and perish. 
Let  us  keep  that  in  mind  as  we  study  God’s  Word.  Even  if  there  are  
matters in the Word that we cannot fully understand, let us pray, “Lord, 
we  want  to  understand  Your  heart,  even  if  we  don’t  understand  the  
meaning of everything in Your Word.”
We must pray as we study the Scriptures that we will understand what 
is in the heart of God. We can get so taken up with little details as we 
study, that we miss seeing the heart of God. God reveals His heart in His 
Word.
But God’s purpose does not stop there – just like the construction of a 
building does not stop with laying the foundation. We read in 2 Timothy 
3:16, 17: “All Scripture is inspired by God (God-breathed) and profitable 
for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that 
the man of God may be adequate (perfect), equipped for every good work.”
God breathed into this book, exactly as He breathed into Adam. If God 
had not breathed into Adam, Adam would have been just a pile of dust; 
and any book that God has not breathed into is also a pile of dust.
God’s Word has been given to us:
1. To teach us, to show us the right path.
2. To reprove us and rebuke us. We need strong rebukes to be preserved 
in the pathway of godliness.

xvi Why God Gave Us the Bible
3. To correct us when we go astray, to direct us into the right path.
4. To train us in righteousness. It is a training manual.
So we see that God’s Word has been given to us to change our character, 
so that we can become godly men and women. 
The ultimate goal is “that the man of God may be adequate” – perfect 
and  complete. Like a glass of water filled to the brim, our character is 
to  be  rounded  off,  balanced  and  complete.  We  are  to  be  anointed  and  
equipped to serve God, so that we can do every good work that God has 
planned for us. That is the purpose of Scripture.
So if you study the Bible, you must study it for these reasons.
The Holy Spirit alone can teach us God’s Word. The same Holy Spirit 
Who taught the apostles in the 1
st
  century, seeks to teach us in the 21
st
 
century too. That is how I studied the Scriptures from the time I was born 
again in July 1959. I have never been to a Bible-school or Bible-college. 
The Holy Spirit taught me God’s Word, as I spent many hours studying 
it.  When  Jesus  walked  with  two  disciples  to  Emmaus,  He  “opened  the  
Scriptures to them”. That is what He wants to do for us today, as we walk 
with  Him.  Those  disciples  found  that  their  “hearts  burned  within  them  
when the Lord opened the Scriptures to them” (Luke 24:32). That is what 
will happen to our hearts too, when the Holy Spirit opens the Scriptures 
to us today.
The truths that God reveals in His Word can never be boring, because 
Jesus is never boring. If we walk with our Lord and listen to Him, our 
hearts will burn within us – because we will see the glory of Christ in the 
Word.
Under the old covenant, people meditated on God’s written Word. But 
now we meditate on the Word made flesh, our Lord Jesus Christ (John 
1:14). Now  we  see  the  glory  of  Jesus  as  we  meditate  on  the  Scriptures 
(See 2 Corinthians 3:18). A man who looks at that glory constantly will be 
like a tree planted by the rivers of water, and will always be fruitful. Even 
in old age he will bring forth fruit (Psalm 1:3; 92:14). That is the will of 
God for each one of us. 
Proverbs 25:2 says, “It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, and the 
glory of kings to search it out.” Gold and diamonds are found deep down, 
many thousands of feet beneath the earth’s surface. It is the same with 
the  Scriptures  –  its  riches  are  concealed  deep  within.  We  are  kings  in  
Christ and our glory is to find those hidden treasures in God’s Word. 
Jesus  once  said,  “I  thank  You  Father  that  You  have  hidden  these  
things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to babes” 
(Matthew 11:25). We don’t have to be clever to understand the Scriptures, 
but  we  must  have  clean,  humble,  trusting  hearts,  like  an  infant.  It’s  
our heart condition and not our intelligence that determines whether we 
understand God’s Word or not.

Why God Gave Us the Bible                                                                                                                     xvii
God’s Word gives us promises to believe and commands to obey. It has 
words to rebuke us, and words to comfort us as well.
Unless we make the Bible our final authority in all matters relating to 
our faith, we will be tossed about here and there, until our faith itself 
is lost. 
We are told by the psalmist that God has magnified His Word above 
all  His  Name  (Psalm  138:2).  To  reject  or  ignore  it  therefore,  or  to  treat  
it lightly, is to end up with immeasurable loss. But to reverence it is to 
discover a door into untold riches.
So with those words as an introduction, let us begin our study of the 
Word of God.

THE OLD 
TESTAMENT



GENESIS
Beginnings
T
he word ‘Genesis’ means “beginning”. In this book, we read about 
the beginning of creation, the beginning of man, the beginning of 
sin  in  the  human  race,  the  beginning  of  redemption,  the  begin-
ning  of  the  two  streams  of  religiosity  and  spirituality,  the  beginning  of  
Babylon,  the  beginning  of  Jerusalem,  and  the  beginning  of  counterfeit  
religion and true religion.
The  Scriptures  begin  with  the  words,  “In  the  beginning  God.”  That’s  
how  it  must  be  in  our  life  every  day.  God  must  be  in  the  beginning  of  
everything in our lives, not man. In every area of our life – in our goals 
and our ambitions, in everything – God must be first. And wherever God 
finds a man or woman who will put Him first in every area of his/her life 
– in business, in finances, and daily life – there will be no limit to what 
God will do in and through such a person. 
Creation
In Chapter 1, we have a description of creation. Notice two different words 
that  occur  in  this  chapter  –  ‘created’  and  ‘made’.  There  is  a  difference  
between these two words. God created the earth (1:1), but He made the 
firmament (1:7). He created man (1:27), but He made the beasts of the 
earth (1:25). ‘Made’ refers to something made from what already existed, 
whereas ‘created’ refers to something that never existed before.
In  the  beginning,  God  created  the  heavens  and  the  earth.  That  may 
have been millions and millions of years ago – we don’t know. When the 
heavens  and  the  earth  were  created  by  God  through  His  spoken  word  
(Hebrews11:3), He made them perfect. Nothing that God creates is ever 
imperfect.  How  then  did  the  earth  become  empty,  dark  and  shapeless  
(1:2)? God never creates anything empty, dark and shapeless. It became 
like that because something happened between verses 1 and 2.

4 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
The angel Lucifer fell and became the devil. That was when sin first 
came into the universe. That is not mentioned at this point, because the 
Bible was not written for angels, but for man. That’s why the creation of 
man is mentioned in the first chapter, and the fall of Lucifer is mentioned 
only much later (in Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28). 
What  we  read  of  in  the  rest  of  Chapter  1  is  the  re-making of  that  
corrupted, spoilt, dark, empty earth. And by the time you come to the end 
of the chapter, it has become a beautiful earth once again. God Himself 
could look at it and say, “It is very good.”
*
Chapter 1 has a message for all of us. Satan has come into the human 
race too and made man exactly as mentioned in verse 2 – empty, dark 
and shapeless. We have lost the image of God. God did not create Adam 
like  that.  Adam  was  created  perfect.  But  the  devil  came  in  and  ruined  
man. And God had to begin to remake man.
God is in the business of remaking ruined humanity today. It doesn’t 
matter how shapeless, dark or empty you are. Chapter 1 teaches that God 
can remake you. He can make you so perfect that you will finally reflect 
His likeness perfectly, and God Himself will be able to certify about you, 
“Very Good”. That is the message of the very first chapter of the Bible.
But how did this change take place? If you understand how it happened, 
the same thing can happen in your life too. 
Every day God spoke His word. He said something the first day. And 
He  said  something  the  second  day.  Every  day  He  spoke.  That’s  what  
you need to see in the very first chapter of the Bible – that our God is a 
living God Who speaks. If you want to be transformed, the most impor-
tant thing you need is to hear God speaking to you. “Man shall not live 
by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.” 
(Matthew 4:4). That’s how God planned for man to live. And so if we don’t 
listen to His voice daily, we will not be transformed.
We  have  to  develop  the  habit  of  listening  to  God.  God  speaks  every  
day. But most believers do not listen to Him. Even those who read the 
Bible every day don’t listen to God. Listening to God is not the same as 
reading  the  Bible.  You  can  read  the  Bible  like  you  read  a  storybook  or  
study it like a chemistry book – and never hear what God is trying to say 
to your heart.
The other thing we see here is that the Spirit of God moved on the face 
of the waters (1:2). After you hear God speak, you must allow the Holy 
Spirit  to  move  upon  you.  Only  then  can  you  be  transformed.  We  see  
the Holy Spirit working along with God’s Word right from the beginning. 
Only  the  Holy  Spirit  can  change  man.  It  was  the  combined  working  of  
God’s Word and of the Holy Spirit that brought change and beauty to that 
chaotic earth.

   For a more detailed study of the creation and re-making of the earth, read 
my article: “The Creation of the Earth and the Origin of Satan” at: http://www. 
cfcindia.com/article/the-creation-of-the-earth-and-the- origin-of-satan

Creation                                                                                                                                                          5
Genesis
The  great  need  in  Christendom  today  is  for  balance.  Many  believers  
emphasise the study of the word of God, but do not emphasise depend-
ence  on  the  Holy  Spirit  equally.  If  you  study  the  word  of  God  without  
the Holy Spirit’s enabling, you will be as dry as a bone and just as dead. 
Others emphasise the ministry of the Holy Spirit and neglect God’s Word 
and thus get sidetracked into emotionalism, which they mistake for the 
Spirit’s  workings.  Like  steam  engines  that  have  gone  off  the  rails  (of  
God’s Word), they blow their whistles furiously and make a lot of noise, 
but they are stuck in the mud and make no progress, because they do 
not allow the word of God to guide them.
So we see that we can get correction and instruction in righteousness 
in order to be perfect in the very first paragraph of the Scriptures.
In 1:4, we read that “God separated the light from the darkness”. This 
separation is repeated on the fourth day (1:18). This is a very important 
thing,  and  that  is  why  it  is  repeated.  When  God  created  the  light,  He  
didn’t want the darkness mixed up with it and that was why He made a 
separation.
Many people imagine that all division must be from the devil. But here 
we read that the first person to make a division was God Himself. Light 
can have no fellowship with darkness. When light comes into our hearts, 
the very next thing that God wants to do in our lives is to separate us from 
all that is darkness. In 2 Corinthians 4:6 we have a Divine commentary on 
the creation of light. There we are told that this was a picture of the light 
of the gospel of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ coming into our 
hearts. Then two chapters later, in 2 Corinthians 6:14–17, we are told of 
the necessity of separating ourselves from all darkness. The world is full 
of darkness, and there must be nothing of the world in our hearts. When 
Christians don’t separate from the darkness, confusion is the result.
When God placed the sun and the moon in the middle of the skies, again 
He separated the light from the darkness (1:18). On both occasions, we 
read that “God saw that it was good.” Only when you are separated from 
all that is of darkness can God say, “It is good”, not otherwise. Many who 
have received the light have not separated themselves from the darkness. 
That is why they have so many problems in their Christian life.
Man was created on the sixth day. The beasts of the field were also 
made on the same day, just before Adam (verse 24). Those beasts were 
made  from  the  same  dust  that  man  was  made  from.  Only  one  thing  
distinguished man from those beasts: God breathed into man. It is only 
the Spirit of God in man that lifts him above the level of animals. From 
this we learn that if we stop living by the Spirit of God, we will sink to the 
level  of  animals  very  soon!  God  made  man  from  the  dust  to  teach  him  
that he was worth nothing apart from the breath of God.
God kept the seventh day as a day of rest. That was the seventh day for 
God, but it was the first day for man. Man was created towards the end 
of the sixth day and so his very first living day was a day of rest. God was 

6 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
trying to teach man thereby that he must fellowship with God first before 
going out to work for Him. Adam and Eve were to work in the garden of 
Eden only after they had spent a day in fellowship with their God. That is 
the Divine order for man: Fellowship first and then service. In the begin-
ning  God  Himself  –  then  God’s  work.  We  forget  that  order  to  our  peril.  
This was why God taught Israel to respect the Sabbath so strictly. Today, 
there remains a Sabbath rest for God’s people to live in (Hebrews 4:9).
In 1:28 God told Adam and Eve to “be fruitful and multiply.” How did He 
expect them to do that? Obviously by having a sexual relationship. It was 
God Who created the sexual function and told man to use it to produce 
children.  The  sexual  function  in  man  was  also  included  in  what  God  
finally called “Very good” (1:31). So we see that sex in marriage is some-
thing that God himself has termed “Very good”? Sex is very bad outside 
of marriage, but very good inside it. There are many Christians who think 
that sex is a dirty thing even in marriage and therefore imagine that they 
can be holier if they are not married. This is un-Scriptural.
When God created man He blessed him (1:28). He told him not only 
to be fruitful, but also to subdue everything under him and to rule over 
everything. So we see that God created man to be a ruler, not a slave. 
God created man to be an overcomer who has everything under his feet. 
In Genesis, we read of God’s desire for man to rule. And in Revelation, 
we read of God’s desire for man to overcome (Revelation 21:7). That was 
God’s original will for man, and He finally finds a few who fulfil His plan 
and become overcomers. God’s purpose for you is to rule over everything. 
He wants you to rule over sin in your life, over your anger, your lusts 
and your passions. He wants you to put them all under your feet. God 
never created you to be a slave. He created you to be a conqueror and a 
ruler. And that can come about only when God blesses you (as we read 
in 1:28).
Notice in Chapter 1, that God examined each day’s work and certified it 
as good. (God did not say that on the second day, because Satan who had 
been cast down by God was permitted to dwell in the second heaven). We 
too should  allow  God  to  examine  our  work  each  day,  to  see  whether  it  
meets with His approval. 
In Chapter 2, more details are given about the creation of man. We see 
there that God gave man three gifts – a marriage partner (Eve), a home 
to  live  in  (Eden)  and  a  work to  do  (as  a  gardener).  These  are  the  three  
things that many young people are seeking for today. God was interested 
in providing all three for Adam and He is interested in providing all three 
for His children today. Adam didn’t even have to ask God for them. God 
Himself saw Adam’s need and provided him with them. God knows your 
need of a marriage partner, a house and a job too. If you walk with Him, 
He will provide you with these and other needs too.

Creation                                                                                                                                                          7
Genesis
In 2:11,  12,  it  says  that  the  gold  in  Eden  was  good!  It  is  only  in  the  
presence of God, that gold is good. Away from Him, gold is a snare and 
can be a curse.
In 2:19, 20, we read that God brought the beasts to Adam – and Adam 
gave  them  all  names.  Then  we  read  these  words:  “But  for  Adam  there  
was not found a helper suitable for him.” That phrase seems to indicate 
that when Adam saw each of the animals having a partner, he wondered 
whether he could have one of them as a partner!! The lion had its lioness, 
the elephant had its partner, the cat had its partner, and so on. Adam 
looked at them one by one and rejected them one by one, because none 
of them corresponded with his own nature. And when Adam had rejected 
all of them, God said, “All right, I will make a helper for you.” He then 
caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam and made a wife for him.
There is a spiritual application to this: If you are a child of God, and are 
looking for a marriage partner, God may first allow some pretty girls (or 
handsome men) to come by you, who do not have the same Divine nature 
that  you  received  when  you  were  born  again.  He  will  test  you  through  
them to see whether you will choose one of them as your partner. If you 
do,  you  will  miss  the  one  God  has  planned  for  you.  Honour  God  and  
obey  His  word  that  says,  “Don’t  be  unequally  yoked  with  unbelievers” 
(2 Corinthians 6:14) – and He will give you His very best.
Notice this: After God saying that “It was good” six times in 6 days (1:4, 
10, 12, 18, 21, 25), He suddenly said, “It is NOT good” (2:18). It was not 
good for Adam to be alone. Then, after He had made Eve, He says, “It is 
VERY good” (1:31). That is the difference that a happily married couple 
made to God’s creation! 
In 2:24, we read something that all married people need to pay heed 
to: When a person gets married he must leave his father and mother and 
cleave to his partner. This is not referring primarily to leaving one’s parents 
physic ally (although that may also be necessary), but to being detached 
from them emotionally. Once a person is married, his marriage-partner 
must be far more important to him than his parents. A married couple 
must  make  their  family-decisions  in  consultation  with  each  other  and  
not  in  consultation  with  their  parents.  I  wish  I  could  go  up  and  down  
India proclaiming this important message to all married couples. There 
will be many more happy marriages in our land, if every married person 
obeyed this command. Here is a commandment given by God, even before 
sin came into the world. It is in fact the very first commandment written 
in the Bible for us. Why did God put this as the very first commandment 
in Scripture? Because He Who ordained marriage knew the vital import-
ance  of  this  step.  Yet  many  married  couples  have  not  understood  its  
importance.

Genesis
Two Men Who Listened to Satan
In Chapters 3 and 4, we read of two men who listened to the Devil – Adam 
and Cain. We can learn some lessons from how each of them fell a prey 
to Satan’s wiles.
When God sent Adam into Eden, He did not send an angel with him 
to  check  up  on  him.  Why?  Because  it  is  only  when  we  are  not  being  
watched, that God can test our heart’s attitude. He tests us when no-one 
else is around. Adam and Eve were by themselves and could sin without 
being observed by any created being. 
There were thousands of trees with beautiful fruit in Eden. The tree of 
life was there too, that would have brought them eternal life. But Adam 
and Eve did not choose any of these. They went for “knowledge”. They 
rejected life and chose knowledge – exactly like man does today.
If you had a choice between Bible-knowledge and life, which would you 
choose? I’m sure you will all give the right answer: “Life.” But test your-
self: Do you study the Bible to get knowledge or to obey God? If you study 
the Bible in order to get knowledge, you are going to the tree of knowledge 
too. And the knowledge of good and evil will only bring death. God wants 
us to know good and evil through a living connection with Him, and not 
by study of the Scriptures alone. If we have the knowledge of good and 
evil  without  a  living  connection  with  God,  we  will  go  astray.  That  was  
how Adam died – he got the knowledge of good and evil without a living 
connection with God. Our knowledge of good and evil must come through 
the Holy Spirit telling us what is right and wrong, moment by moment. 
Any other way of knowing good and evil will only bring death. 
The devil told Eve that she could be like God (3:5). Jesus came with a 
message that sounded very similar. But it was totally different. Whereas 
Satan  told  Eve  that  she  could  be  like  God  in  knowledge,  authority  and  
power, Jesus tells us that we can be like God in humility, purity and love. 
Which  of  these  two  messages  do  most  people  desire?  Alas,  even  most  
believers hanker after the former!! But it is thus that we can distinguish 
between the voice of the devil and the voice of Jesus. Temptation is very 
subtle. The devil is a deceiver. His counterfeits look just like the genuine 
thing on the surface.
When  the  devil  was  tempting  Eve  he  was  also  insinuating  that  God  
didn’t really love her. If God loved her (Satan implied), God would have 
allowed her to eat from this beautiful tree. That’s the way Satan tries to 
get into our hearts as well – by making us doubt God’s love.
Jesus told Peter, “Satan has decided to sift you and has asked God for 
permission to do so” (Luke 22:31). God gave Satan that permission, just 
like God had given Satan permission to sift Adam and Eve in Eden. The 
Lord told Peter, “I am praying for you that when you are sifted, your faith 
will not fail” (Luke 22:32). Jesus did not pray that Peter would not fall, 
but that even if he fell, he would still believe that God loved him. That is 
faith.

Two Men Who Listened to Satan                                                                                                               9
Genesis
In the hour of trial and temptation, even if we fall, if we still have faith in 
the love of God, we have triumphed. Even if your prayer is not answered 
or  something  you  wanted  was  not  given  to  you,  even  if  you  have  to  go  
through  some  deep  trial  like  Job’s,  where  your  children  die  and  your  
property is lost – don’t ever doubt the love of God. That is true faith.
What does it mean to live by faith? It means to constantly assert (no 
matter  what  happens)  that  God  loves  you.  It  was  such  a  faith  in  his  
father’s love that brought the prodigal son back home. He knew that even 
though  he  had  done  a  lot  of  wrong  things  and  messed  up  his  life,  his  
father still loved him. So he went back to his father.
The tree of knowledge of good and evil looked so attractive! It was God 
Who had made it so attractive because only when it was attractive could 
Adam and Eve be tested as to whether they would choose God Himself 
above  His  beautiful  creation.  In  every  temptation,  what  we  essentially  
face is this: Are we going to choose the Creator or His creation? The temp-
tation could be a pretty woman or gold or some other created thing. Even 
when seeking the honour or approval of men, the alternate choice is the 
approval of God. Which do you want? We sin when we choose the created 
thing above the Creator. We overcome when we choose the Creator above 
all  His  creation.  It  is  as  simple  as  that.  Yet  most  people  in  the  world  
(including believers) fail this test daily.
We  either  worship  God’s  creation  –  a  beautiful  face  or  gold  or  some  
man’s approval – or we consider all of this as garbage compared to God 
Himself. To the overcomer, the beauty of Jesus and His approval are far 
more valuable than anything He created. If you were to make just this 
one choice in every decision in life, you will be a man of God. You will be 
a woman of God. You will know God and His Word in a personal way – 
better than any man can teach you. Make that choice in every temptation 
and say, “Lord, I choose You above all created things.” That is the secret.
What was Adam’s sin? Was it just that he ate of the fruit of the tree 
that was forbidden? No. It was more than that. In 3:17, God told him, 
“You listened to the voice of your wife.” Is it a sin to listen to the voice of 
one’s wife? Yes, if it leads to disobeying God. God had made Adam the 
head of his home. But he did not exercise his authority as the head. 
He saw his wife talking to the devil and he just stood there listening to 
the conversation and made no effort to stop her. He should have put 
his foot down and said, ‘Come away, Eve. Don’t listen to him.” There 
are many husbands like Adam today. They are not the head in their 
homes. Adam sinned when he did not assert his headship. 
God is a good God. He cursed the serpent and the ground, but He did 
not curse  Adam.  There  we  see  the  tremendous  love  of  God.  God  killed  
an animal to cover Adam and Eve. That was the first death on earth. An 
innocent animal was killed as a sacrifice for Adam’s sin, and that animal’s 

10 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
skin  was  used  to  make  garments  to  cover  the  nakedness  of  Adam  and  
Eve (3:21). That was a picture of what God would one day do on Calvary’s 
cross, allowing His Son to die so that His righteousness may clothe us.
Before man sinned, there was no flaming sword in front of the tree of 
life. Adam could have gone to it and eaten of it and received eternal life. 
But God put a flaming sword in front of that tree after man sinned. Today, 
if you want to partake of that tree, you have to let the sword fall upon your 
flesh. We don’t have to be punished for our sins now, because that sword 
fell upon Jesus on Calvary. But that sword must fall on our flesh today. 
As  Paul  said,  “I am crucified with Christ... and I live.”  (Galatians  2:20). 
When we are united with Jesus on the cross, that sword falls on our flesh 
and we can partake of eternal life. There is no other way to life. This sword 
guards this tree even today.
Notice some of the words that God spoke to Adam as the punishment 
for  his  sin  –  curse,  sorrow,  thorns,  sweat,  dust,  death  (3:16–19).  All  
these words are found in the suffering and death of Jesus on the cross. 
Jesus took all of this upon Himself, so that we can be totally free from 
the punishment that was put upon Adam in Eden.
We  see  that  as  soon  as  Adam’s  fellowship  with  God  was  broken,  his  
fellowship with his wife was broken too. The proof of this is seen in the 
fact that he begins to accuse her. Whenever you begin to accuse others, 
it proves that your fellowship with God is broken. When you are in fellow-
ship  with  God  you  don’t  accuse  others.  You  judge  yourself.  It  is  Satan  
who is the Accuser of the brethren.
In Chapter 4, we read of another man who listened to the devil – Cain. 
Eve gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have created a man with the help of 
the Lord” (4:1). A human birth was a miracle at that time, for Cain was 
the first person to be born into the world as a living soul. And Eve said, 
“God made a man. And I made a man too!! I have created a man out of my 
own body.” It was a spirit of pride that manifested itself there: “I made, 
I created. God helped me a little, but I did it.” And her son Cain grew up 
with that wrong spirit.
Cain and Abel came to present their offerings to God. If you read 4:4 
carefully, you will discover that it does not say there (as some imagine) 
that God accepted Abel’s offering and therefore accepted Abel. No. It 
says,  “The  Lord  had  regard  for  Abel  (first)  and  (then)  for  his  offering” 
–  not  the  other  way  around.  Similarly,  it  was  not  because  the  Lord  
rejected Cain’s offering that He rejected Cain. No. He rejected Cain first 
and therefore He rejected his offering too. The Bible says, “The sacrifice 
of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,” no matter how good the 
sacrifice may be (Proverbs  21:27).  Cain  was  a  wicked  man,  and  that  
was why God rejected his offering.

Two Men Who Listened to Satan                                                                                                             11
Genesis
When Cain was angry, God came to warn Cain that he was in danger. 
In Eden, God came seeking Adam and now He comes seeking Cain. God 
is always the One Who comes seeking for fallen man. Jesus came into the 
world seeking for fallen man too. God is the One Who comes seeking for 
us every time we backslide or go astray. That is a great encouragement 
to us. God came and warned Cain, but Cain did not take heed to that 
warning. He allowed the sin that was crouching at the door of his heart 
to come inside and destroy him.
Jealousy is the first sin mentioned in the Scriptures, after man was 
put out of Eden – jealousy of a younger brother who was more blessed 
by God. Whenever you see someone younger than you more blessed and 
more anointed by God than you, be careful that you don’t become jealous 
of him, lest you go the way of Cain.
Notice  what  God  said  to  Cain  now:  “You  are  cursed”  (4:11).  Why  did  
God  curse  Cain  but  not  Adam?  In  Adam’s  case,  God  cursed  only  the  
ground, but not Adam. The reason is that when Adam sinned, he hurt 
only himself. But when Cain sinned, he hurt somebody else as well. When 
you commit a sin like smoking or drinking, you destroy your body, but 
you hurt only yourself. But when you gossip, you hurt another person 
and that sin is therefore more serious. But how many Christians believe 
that gossiping is worse than smoking? The sins that hurt other people 
are much more serious in God’s eyes than those sins that hurt only you. 
That  is  why  Cain  was  cursed.  So,  take  it  seriously  whenever  you  hurt  
another person. 
God said to Cain (4:10), “The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out 
to Me from the ground.” That person’s blood, whose reputation you spoilt 
by gossiping, is crying out to God. It will never stop crying out until you 
confess your sin to God and ask Him to forgive you and until you confess 
your sin to the person you gossiped against and ask him to forgive you 
too. Otherwise, your sin will keep on crying out to God until the day of 
judgement.
When Cain was punished he said, “My punishment is too great to bear!” 
This is the language of people who go to hell. They don’t say “My sin 
is very great”. They only say, “My punishment is very great.” Are you 
more disturbed by your sin or by its punishment? Through the answer 
to that question, you can discover whether you are a godly man or an 
ungodly man. An ungodly man is worried about the punishment he is 
going to get, whereas a godly man is heartbroken by his sin.
Cain went away from the presence of the Lord and his children became 
like him. One of his sons became a murderer. They married many wives. 
They made musical instruments to entertain themselves. There we see the 
beginning of rock music and the entire entertainment world. This is what 
happens to children, when their fathers go away from the Lord (4:16–24).

12 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
In Cain and Abel, we see the beginning of two streams – the religious 
stream and the spiritual stream. Cain was not an atheist. He was a deeply 
religious man. He was the forerunner of the Babylonian system of coun-
terfeit religion. Abel was the forerunner of all godly men. Jesus referred 
to Abel as a righteous man (Matthew 23:35). Cain was religious, whereas 
Abel was spiritual.
Two Men Who Walked With God
We have seen two examples of men who walked with the devil – Adam and 
Cain. Now consider two men who walked with God – Enoch and Noah. 
In Chapter  5,  we  read  the  expression  ‘and  he  died’  eight  times.  But  
right in the middle of that chapter, we read of one who did not die at all!! 
That was Enoch. He walked with God and God took him to heaven alive. 
That is a picture of resurrection life in the midst of death. Enoch was a 
man who lived in resurrection power, overcame death and was taken up 
to  heaven  –  a  picture  of  a  godly  church  living  in  the  midst  of  spiritual  
death, overcoming by resurrection power and finally being raptured. 
Enoch was probably a godless man for the first 65 years of his life. But 
at 65, he got a son. He named the boy “Methuselah”, by Divine revela-
tion. “Methuselah” means “At his death, the waters will come forth.” That 
seems  to  indicate  that  God  gave  Enoch  a  revelation  when  his  son  was  
born. God told Enoch that when that son died, the world would be judged 
by a flood of waters. That revelation of judgement came first to Enoch 
and not to Noah. So he named his son Methuselah.
Now when you have a baby, you don’t know how long he will live. So 
every time Methuselah was sick, Enoch would have wondered whether 
the time for judgement was near. Can you imagine a baby having a name 
that means, “At his death the flood will come”? Each time you called him, 
you would be reminded of judgement. And that fear of God’s judgement 
made Enoch walk with God and realise that the things of eternity were 
more important than the things of time. That was the crisis that made 
Enoch walk with God every day for the next 300 years.
The Bible says, “The world will pass away” (1 John 2:17). If we believe 
that, we too will realise, as Enoch did, that the things of eternity are more 
important than the things of time. 
God’s tremendous longsuffering with man is seen in the fact that He 
allowed  Methuselah  to  live  longer  than  any  other  human  being  –  969  
years.  For  969  years,  whenever  people  heard  Methuselah’s  name,  they  
heard  a  message  of  judgement  to  come.  But  the  people  rejected  the  
message.  It  was  not  only  Noah  who  preached  about  this  judgement.  
Enoch preached it for 300 years too and Methuselah preached it by his 
name for another 669 years. 
Noah  also  walked  with  God  and  preached  about  judgement  for  the  
last 120 years of Methuselah’s life. Enoch and Methuselah did not know 

Two Men Who Walked With God                                                                                                            13
Genesis
the details of the flood as clearly as God later revealed to Noah. But they 
knew that some type of judgement connected with a flood of waters was 
going to come when Methuselah died. 
Jude  tells  us  that  Enoch  prophesied  judgement  against  all  the  
ungodly  people  of  his  time  (Jude  14,  15).  Enoch  was  a  prophet  and  
he walked with God. Adam was 622 years old when Enoch was born, 
and died at the age of 930 (5:5–23). So Enoch must have known Adam 
for 308 years. I can imagine that Enoch must have often asked Adam 
about how things were in Eden where Adam himself had once walked 
with God. And Enoch must have had a great longing to walk with God 
himself. Enoch became the first man to prove that one could walk with 
God outside Eden too. Even after sin came into the world, man could 
walk with God. 
I’ve met a lot of great preachers in my life, but I have met very few who 
walk with God. But it is those few who produced a longing in my heart 
from my younger days, to walk with God myself.
Methuselah’s  grandson  was  Noah.  And  Noah  lived  with  Methuselah  
for 600 years. He must have asked Methuselah many times about how 
Enoch had walked with God. Into Noah’s heart came a longing to walk 
with  God  himself.  We  read  in  6:9 that  Noah  also  walked  with  God.  As  
Noah walked with God, God revealed His purpose of judgement to him.
It  was  the  truth  of  judgement  against  sin  that  God  revealed  to  the  
first  two  people  who  walked  with  God  (in  Scripture).  And  Enoch  and 
Noah  faithfully  preached  that  message,  even  though  no-one  believed  
them. Every true prophet of God since then has also preached the same 
message: God will judge believers and unbelievers for their sins.
Enoch and Noah are the first two preachers mentioned in the Bible 
and they both walked with God. Would to God that every preacher since 
then had done the same. 
God told Noah to build the ark and Noah immediately began to build it. 
He did not ask God who was going to pay for the ark. If he had asked God 
that, God would have told him, “You have to pay for it yourself of course.” 
Have you ever heard God tell you that you must pay for the expenses of 
His work from your own pocket? Most Christian workers feel that if they 
do  God’s  work,  someone  else  must  pay  them  for  that!  But  Noah  didn’t  
think like that. He supported himself and his family and served the Lord. 
He had to put in extra hours of work to earn the money needed to build 
the ark. But he did that gladly. God needs men like that today too. If, as 
Jesus said, the last days are going to be evil like in Noah’s time, then God 
must be needing many “Noahs” in the last days too – men who like the 
apostle Paul support themselves and serve the Lord.
People must have asked Noah how the animals would come into the 
ark.  Noah  knew  that  that  was  God’s  business  and  not  his.  And  God  
brought the animals inside supernaturally. Noah only did what he was 
supposed to do – build the ark. He left all other matters with God. We too 

14 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
have to do only what God has told us to do. We can leave all the impos-
sibilities with God. 
Finally we read that God shut the door (7:16). It was God who shut the 
door of the ark, not Noah. God will also shut the door of salvation one day 
when the time is up for entering God’s kingdom. 
The  ark  is  a  picture  of  Christ  and  of  His  Body,  the  church.  It  must  
have been inconvenient living inside the ark, just like it can be in the 
church! In the church, we have to mingle with people who are different 
from us, and many of them may rub us the wrong way at times. But 
even if the ark was not convenient, it was the only safe place on earth 
at that time. So is the church today. I am happy to be in the church, 
even if there are difficult people in it. I hope you are happy too. That’s 
why we invite people to join us.
When the flood was finally about to subside, Noah sent a crow and a 
dove out of the ark – a picture of the flesh and the Spirit. The crow never 
came back. The crow found the dead bodies of men and animals and was 
delighted  at  the  feast  that  all  that  provided  for  it.  Similarly,  those  who  
live according to the dictates of their flesh find the world a very enjoyable 
place. But the dove came back very quickly. And that is how it is with those 
who live according to the Spirit. They never feel at home in the world and 
always long to come back to the fellowship of God’s people in the church. 
After Noah came out of the ark, the first thing he did was to build an 
altar to the Lord on which he offered a sacrifice of thanksgiving (8:20). 
That example of putting God first and offering Him our worship and 
thanksgiving is a good example for us to follow at all times.
Noah however was not a perfect man. He got drunk one day and lay 
naked in his tent. His son Ham saw him and reported this to his broth-
ers. Because Ham dishonoured his father thus, a curse came upon him. 
Shem and Japheth however walked backwards and covered their father’s 
nakedness. Therefore they were blessed. There is an important message 
here for us. This is the first place in Scripture where we read of God 
punishing a son and his seed for dishonouring his father. It is a serious 
matter before God, when we disrespect authority. When you see a weak-
ness in your father or in a man of God, don’t expose his nakedness to 
others, as Ham did, unless you want to get a curse upon yourself. Be like 
Shem and Japheth and cover it. “Love covers a multitude of sins” (1 Peter 
4:8; Proverbs 10:12). Noah blessed Shem and Japheth with the blessing 
of fellowship saying, “May God enlarge Japheth, and let them dwell in the 
tents of Shem” (9:27). We too must build fellowship with those who live 
together and cover each other’s sins. Only such believers can build the 
church of Jesus Christ. 

Babylon                                                                                                                                                         15
Genesis
Babylon
In Chapter 10, we see a continuation of the two streams that began with 
Cain and Abel – religiosity and spirituality. If these streams were atheism 
and spirituality, the difference between them would have been as clear as 
black and white. But religiosity and spirituality are like cream and white. 
Only in bright light can the distinction between these two colours be seen 
clearly. The devil is a deceiver and he makes the counterfeit look as much 
like the genuine as possible. The gate to the broad way looks very similar 
to the gate of the narrow way, and a lot of people who enter through it 
don’t even realise that they are entering the broad way. They are deceived 
by clever preachers. We must be careful.
I am talking now about believers who are deceived. Consider just one 
area:  How  many  believers  really  believe  what  Jesus  said:  “You  cannot  
serve God and money” (Luke 16:13)? Very, very few. There are multitudes 
of Christians and Christian workers who believe that they can serve both 
God and money at the same time. That’s just one example of the great 
work  that  Satan  has  done  in  deceiving  Christians.  There  are  believers  
who  love  money  and  who  imagine  that  they  love  God  too,  even  though  
Jesus  said  that  this  was  impossible.  Such  people  are  not  spiritual  but  
only religious.
In Chapter 10, we read of the beginning of Babylon. Its destruction is 
described in Revelation 18. Babylon appears at the beginning of the Bible 
and continues until the end of the Bible. We read here of a man named 
Nimrod  (10:8,  9) who  was  a  mighty  hunter  “against  the  Lord”  (Literal  
translation). The beginning of his kingdom was Babel (or Babylon). Babel 
originally meant ‘the gate of God.’ Nimrod was not an atheist. Like Cain, 
he was a religious man whose profession was to lead people to God! That 
is how the Babylonian system works.
Babylon  is  a  religious system  (Revelation  17) as  well  as  a  financial 
system (Revelation 18). Money and the work of God are joined together, 
and that’s how Babylon is formed. And that’s how people are deceived. 
They think they are doing the Lord’s work, but they are drawn towards 
the work because there is money to be earned in it too! There is fame to 
be earned there too. 
Christendom has become like that today. We see preachers today using 
the money given for God’s work by poor people, to build expensive houses 
and  to  buy  expensive  cars  for  themselves,  with  a  lifestyle  that  resem-
bles that of film stars and not that of Jesus Christ and His apostles. We 
don’t  have  to  judge them,  because  the  Bible  tells  us  not  to  judge.  But  
we must not follow them either. Neither should we be deceived by them. 
Let  us  follow  Jesus  instead.  A  “Christian”  religious  system  that  brings  
people fame, wealth and power is certainly a Babylonian system. Babylon 
claims to show people the gate to God (Babel). But it actually leads them 
to the gate to hell. Jesus said, “I am the door” (John 10:9) He is the door 
to Jerusalem, the true church of God.

16 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
Nimrod is a type of the Antichrist, who will arise in the future. It says 
here that he was a hunter. Perhaps a lot of people were being killed by 
wild  animals  in  those  days,  and  Nimrod  hunted  down  those  animals  
and got a name as a great deliverer. Thus he became a world-leader. The 
Antichrist is going to be like that in the last days. He is going to deliver 
people in some amazing way and will thus earn the respect of many. In 
Revelation, we  read  that  a  false  prophet  will  be  very  closely  associated  
with the antichrist. Religion and politics will be closely joined together in 
the last days. We see that at election time both in India as well as in the 
United States. Political leaders know that using the religious card will get 
them more votes. Even the “Christian religion” is used by politicians for 
promoting  themselves.  But  that  is  not  the  faith  of  Jesus  Christ.  Jesus 
said “My kingdom is not of this world” (John 18:36). That is the identify-
ing mark of the true faith. You could never get Jesus or His apostles to 
be secular kings like Nimrod was. They were servants. Once when they 
tried to make Jesus a king, He ran away from their midst. He would not 
be their king. 
In 11:4, we read that the people of the world decided to build a tower. 
They  said  to  each  other,  “Come,  let  us  build  for  ourselves  a  city  and  
a  tower  whose  top  would  reach  to heaven.”  They  wanted  their  tower  
to  be  the  gate  of  God  (Babel).  Human  effort  to  reach  God  is  a  major  
constituent of false religion. False religion is always a religion of works 
–  and  not  one  of  faith  and  dependence  on  God.  The  leaders  of  false  
religion are always strong personalities with the charisma of film stars. 
They are not weak, unimpressive men like Paul, nor are they men with 
no  reputation  like  Peter.  The  leaders  of  false  Christianity  are  people  
who seek fame and honour for themselves. The true prophets of God 
however are always misunderstood and called “heretics” and cast out 
by religious Christendom. That’s how Jesus and the apostles were.
There can be a lot of unity in Babylon. It says here that the whole earth 
used the same language (11:1) – not just the same language in terms of 
speech, but also the same language of human cleverness, human ability 
and  human  glory.  That  is  the  language  spoken  by  the  world  and  that  
unfortunately is the language spoken by many “Christian” leaders as well. 
Jesus Christ however was crucified through weakness and there was no 
beauty in Him to attract people (2 Corinthians 13:4; Isaiah 53:2). He was 
a servant Who washed people’s feet. He was not a General Director or a 
Superintendent  or  a  Pope.  He  called  himself  an  ordinary  man  (“son  of  
man”) and had no title whatsoever. These are the identifying marks of a 
true servant of God. 
In Babylon they say, “Come, let us build.” They don’t need to consult 
God about such matters. They could build the gateway to heaven them-
selves! False religion does not depend helplessly on God for its every need. 

Babylon                                                                                                                                                         17
Genesis
They  may  pray.  All  religions  have  prayer,  but  it  will  be  meaningless  
prayer.  The  prophets  of  Baal  prayed  for  hours  on  Mount  Carmel,  but  
nothing happened. Elijah prayed for one minute and the fire of God fell 
from heaven! Some of us may glory in hours spent in prayer. That may 
be good. Jesus spent all night in prayer too. But prayer has value only if 
it is an expression of our helpless dependence on God for His guidance 
and help. Babylonians however do not need to seek God’s will, for they 
depend on human cleverness. False religion begins with man, not with 
God. Its motto is: “In the beginning man,” not “In the beginning God,” (as 
in 1:1). False religion originates in man, it is done through man’s power 
and it is propagated for man’s glory.
The  Bible  speaks  about  building  with  wood,  hay  and  straw  or  with  
gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3:12). What does it mean 
to  build  with  gold,  silver  and  precious  stones?  The  answer  is  found  
in Romans  11:36:  “From  God,  through  God  and  to  God”.  This  is  how  
Jerusalem  (the  true  church  of  God)  is  built.  The  opposite  of  that  is  
“From man, through man and to man.” That is how Babylon is built. 
Babylon  is  built  by man’s  ideas.  A  lot  of  Christian  organisations  
are  doing  their  work  today  through  human  ideas  and  not  God’s.  They  
follow  the  principles  of  multinational companies  and  large  business  
corporations, rather than the teachings of the apostles. They run their 
organisations  like  business  enterprises  and  not  like  the  churches  that  
the  apostles  built.  Why  didn’t  Jesus  give  His  gospel  to  an  advertising  
agency? Wouldn’t they have done a better job than those twelve apostles? 
But that would have been man’s method. God’s methods are different.
Very few people know God’s methods, because very few people know 
God. Man is a religious creature and he would rather have religion than 
God. It is uncomfortable to live with God. It is comfortable to live with reli-
gion. You cannot live with God and be a great man in the world. But you 
can have the “Christian religion” and still be a great man. People don’t 
want God. Even most believers would rather have Christianity than God 
Himself. They don’t want the yoke of Jesus Christ on their necks.
Babylon is built through man’s power. It does not need the Holy Spirit’s 
anointing  or  the  supernatural  gifts  that  God  gives.  With  natural  gifts,  
good music and electronic gadgets, the job can be done! No wonder our 
work for God is of such poor quality! We do not know the power that the 
early  apostles  knew.  The  baptism  in  the  Holy  Spirit  that  many  people  
claim to have experienced today, I am convinced is a counterfeit baptism 
of their own human soul – a psychological experience that satisfies them 
but far removed from what the apostles received on the day of Pentecost. 
Few  today  have  experienced  that  genuine  anointing  of  the  Holy  Spirit  
that came upon Jesus and the apostles. I would urge you to seek for that 
genuine enduement with power that Jesus promised His apostles, before 

18 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
He ascended to heaven. Thus alone can we truly serve God. Why do I say 
that a lot that goes on today in the name of the Holy Spirit is counterfeit? 
Because Jesus said that we would be able to identify false prophets by 
their  fruits.  The  love  of  money  is  so  glaringly  obvious  in  most  of  those  
who claim to be baptised in the Holy Spirit today. Such fruit is certainly 
not from God, for the Holy Spirit is not a lover of money. These people 
love power, position and the honour of men. These are not the fruit of the 
Holy Spirit. Then their “power” must be coming from some other source, 
from some other spirit.
Babylon is built for man’s glory. “Let us make a name” is what we read 
in 11:4. Years later, we read in Daniel 4:30 that Nebuchadnezzar looked 
over the city of Babylon that he had built. I have heard that it was built as 
a square, 25 kilometres long and wide, with walls that were 87 feet thick 
and 350 feet high. It had a beautiful hanging garden that was one of the 
wonders of the world. And Nebuchadnezzar said, “Is this not Babylon the 
great, which I myself have built, by the might of my power for my glory?” 
It  was  built  from  man,  through  man  and  to  man.  Nebuchadnezzar  lived  
nearly 2000 years after the building of the tower of Babel. But he had the 
same spirit. 2500 years after Nebuchadnezzar, we find the same spirit 
in operation in Christendom today. This is what Babylon is – From man, 
through man and to man. And it is the very opposite of Jerusalem.
We read in 11:5 that “the Lord came down to see what man had built”. 
Remember that the Lord will come down to examine whatever we build. 
He does not come to examine the size of our church or organization, but 
the  motive  with  which  it  was  built.  For  whose  glory  was  it  built?  If  He  
were examining the size of the Tower of Babel, it was very impressive. But 
God came down looking for something else at that time. And He comes 
down looking for something else today as well.
Jerusalem – Abraham and Melchizedek
In 12:1, we see the beginning of the building of the true Jerusalem. This 
began with Abraham through whom came the nation of Israel the capital 
of which was Jerusalem. There would have been no Jerusalem if there 
had  been  no  Abraham.  We  observe  in  Abraham  something  completely  
different from what we see in Babylon. It says, “The Lord said to Abram, 
‘Go forth from your country, and from your relatives and from your father’s 
house to the land which I will show you.’ ”
†
Abraham didn’t suddenly get a bright idea one day like these people 
in Babel, and say, “I think I have lived long enough in Ur. Let me move 
to  Canaan  and  do  something  there.”  No.  His  move  was  totally  dictated  
by God. Abraham was 75 years old. It is good to wait for even 75 years 
to  hear  God  and  then  move.  Moses  waited  for  40  years  as  a  shepherd

and then moved, when God spoke to him. And think of what he accom-
plished! I am not saying we must wait for 75 or 80 years. All I am saying 
is that we must wait until we hear from God and then move. But, do you 
think busy 21
st
-century-man has time for that? No.
I am thankful that when I was a young man, God taught me one lesson: 
“Don’t let men move you. Let God alone move you.” Many good men have 
urged  me  to  do  various  things  –  including  my  co-workers.  I  hear  their  
advice, but I don’t move until God also speaks to me. I wait until I hear 
God, because I know I will end up disastrously, if I listen to the opinions 
of men. I am not saying that we should not consider the opinions of our 
co-workers. All I’m saying is that the final voice we hear must be God’s. 
God  told  Abraham  to  “Go,”  and  he  went.  God  told  Moses  to  “Go,”  and  
he went. God told Paul to “Go,” and he went. These are the people who 
accomplished something with their lives. Today people run around trying 
to  do  something  or  the  other  for  God.  But  they  accomplish  nothing  of  
eternal value. Statistics-wise, what they do may be impressive. But it’s 
all religious Babylon, and not Jerusalem.
“Come,  let’s  move.  Let’s  do  something  for  the  Lord.  Let’s  make  bricks,  
let’s  make  mortar,  let’s  do  something.”  You  can  impress  men.  “Let  us  
make us a name.” And you may make a great name for yourself building 
Babylon – like Nebuchadnezzar did. This is happening today in Christian 
work  and  that  is  the  message  in  Revelation17  and  18.  But  Abraham  
waited for God’s “Go.”
Notice that whenever Abraham moved without the leading of God, he 
got  into  trouble.  For  example:  We  read  that  God  had  told  Abraham  to  
leave  Ur  of  the  Chaldees  and  to  go  where  He  would  lead  him.  But  in  
Chapter  11:31  we  read  that  it  was  Terah  (Abraham’s  father)  who  took  
Abraham and moved out of Ur. But what had God told Abraham? “Leave 
your relatives and leave your father’s house.” But here we see the 75-year-
old Abraham holding his Daddy’s hand and moving out! That was how 
Abraham started!!
The ones who will hinder you from doing the will of God will be your 
relatives first of all – your parents, your brothers, your sisters, your 
wife and your children. Jesus said, “If any man comes to Me and does 
not hate his father, mother, brother, sister, wife and children, he cannot 
be My disciple” (Luke 14:26). You may want to follow the Lord. But your 
father or your wife may say “No”!
So  Terah  took  Abraham,  and  they  came  as  far  as  Haran  (11:31)  and  
settled  there.  That  was  not  God’s  will.  Why  did  they  settle  there?  That  
was Terah’s idea. Haran perhaps had good pasture-land for the flocks. 
But  it  was  not  God’s  place.  And  Abraham  settled  down  there  with  his  
Daddy! Abraham was a man who made mistakes – and the first mistake 
he made was to listen to his father, when God had already told him to do 

20 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
something else. So what did God do? God can easily deal with such situa-
tions. He took away Terah through death (11:32)! Then “Abram went forth 
as the Lord had spoken to him.” (12:4).
Do you have to wait until God does something drastic like that before 
you move on? If God loves you, He will do something drastic like that. 
But if God sees that you yourself are a compromiser, He may allow you 
to stay on in Haran all your life and miss the will of God totally. Learn 
to move with God. Don’t listen to relatives who do not know God. By all 
means, learn from a father if he is a godly man, who knows God – but not 
from a father who is worldly. (I’m referring to spiritual principles here). 
Finally when Abraham reached Canaan, “the Lord appeared to him and 
said ‘To your descendants I will give this land.’” (12:5, 7). 
And then God tested Abraham again. God tested Adam and He tested 
Abraham, and He will test you and me too. This time the test was through 
a famine in the land (12:10). What do you do when God has told you to 
go  to  Canaan  and  there  is  a  famine  in  Canaan?  You  either  live  by  the  
witness of your senses or you live by what God has told you through His 
Spirit. There is a lovely verse that says about Jesus that “He would not 
make a judgment either by what His eyes saw or His ears heard.” (Isaiah 
11:3,  4).  But  that  is  not  the  way  man  lives.  If  we  hear  about  or  see  a  
famine  in  Canaan,  we  make  a  decision  immediately,  by  what  our  eyes  
and ears and our clever brain tell us. We decide that Canaan is certainly 
not the place to be in now. We need to move on. We don’t have to consult 
God, because we are living by our senses! That was what Abraham did: 
“So Abram went down to Egypt” (12:10). Who told him to go to Egypt? Not 
God, but his senses!
Can’t God preserve a man during a time of famine? Certainly. “Blessed 
is  the  man  who  trusts  in  the  Lord.  He  will  not  be  barren  even  in  time  of  
famine” (Jeremiah 17:5–8). The man who trusts in the Lord will not move 
until God tells him to. That was what our Lord told Satan in the wilder-
ness  when  He  was  tempted.  Satan  told  Jesus  to  turn  the  stones  into  
bread. There was a famine there in the wilderness and there were no food 
stores around. But Jesus replied, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but 
by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.” (Matthew 4:4).
But Abraham did not live like that. He decided to live by bread alone. 
So, since there was bread in Egypt, he went there. That is how a lot of 
Christian work is done today too. Most Christian workers don’t go where 
the Lord tells them to go. They go where they can get a good salary, where 
bread  is  available  in  plenty.  They  join  organisations  where  there  is  no  
famine of money. “Egypt” may be a comfortable place to be in – during a 
famine. But the question is whether that is the place that God wants you 
to be in. If God has called you to be in “Canaan”, you should not move to 
“Egypt”. If you don’t hear what God is saying to you right now, you may 
do the same thing when you are tested. Live by the words that come from 

Jerusalem – Abraham and Melchizedek                                                                                                 21
Genesis
the mouth of God, like Jesus did. His attitude was, “Yes. Bread is neces-
sary for life. But to obey God is more necessary for life.”
If  Satan  tempted  even  Jesus  like  this,  don’t  you  think  he  will  tempt  
you  too  –  to  go  where  there  is  plenty  of  bread?  If  you  are  in  full-time  
Christian work and face a financial trial, Satan will tell you that you can 
get more money in another organization or another church and tell you 
to go there. May God have mercy on you at such a time, that you don’t 
listen to Satan and thus ruin your life.
What was the result of Abraham’s going down to Egypt? He had to tell 
a lie there, that his wife was his sister. You can get into a lot of problems 
when  you  go  to  ‘Egypt’.  You  have  to  tell  lies,  write  false  reports,  state  
things that are not 100% true, compromise your conscience etc.,
Sarah was about 65 or 70 years old. But she must still have been a 
very attractive woman, for Pharaoh the king of Egypt to want her in his 
harem.  The  sad  thing  is  that  even  when  Abraham  saw  his  wife  being  
taken into the harem to be corrupted, he still loved his own life so much, 
that he didn’t tell Pharaoh the truth. It is when we are in a tight spot that 
we discover whether we love the truth or not.
So  we  see  that  the  great  Abraham  was  a  man  who  made  serious  
mistakes. At first, he held his Daddy’s hand and disobeyed God. Then he 
told a lie to save his life, even when it meant losing his wife. Such was the 
man whom God chose – a weak and selfish man. Abraham was just like 
us. And that is our encouragement. God can use us too.
But God saved Abraham from both situations. God delivered him from 
Haran and God delivered Sarah from Pharaoh. And God will deliver us 
too,  even  when  we  have  made  mistakes,  if  He  sees  that  our  heart  is  
sincere, like Abraham’s was. That is what encourages us.
It  was  Pharaoh  who  rebuked  Abraham  for  telling  a  lie  (12:18).  Can  
you imagine a heathen king rebuking a prophet of God for telling a lie? 
Sometimes God’s people get into compromising situations where worldly 
people have to correct them. That is what happens when we go to ‘Egypt’.
Now I want to mention something more serious. Something happened in 
Egypt that produced consequences for the next 4000 years. When Abraham 
went to Egypt and saw the rich people there having maids (female serv-
ants)  in  their  houses,  he  decided  to  have  one  himself  too.  So  he  picked  
up a  servant-woman named Hagar. When he came back from Egypt, he 
brought her with him. Sarah didn’t have to do all the work in the tent now. 
Hagar was there to help her. Later, when Sarah didn’t have any children, 
Hagar was there to help her with that problem too! Through Hagar came 
Ishmael whose descendants have been in conflict with the descendants of 
Isaac for 4000 years. But all this started with one man not listening to God 
once. You may say, “Well, most of the time I listen to God.” Good. But what 
we see here is the consequence of not listening to God just once. I hope 
that message will come home to us with seriousness.

22 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
Who  are  the  ones  who  can  build  Jerusalem?  Men  who  listen  to  God.  
When there is a famine, we must wait on God, and say, “Lord, what do 
You want me to do?” Maybe God will tell us to go somewhere. Maybe not. 
Years later, God did tell Jacob to go to Egypt during a time of famine. But 
that  was  not  God’s  will  at  this  time  for  Abraham.  If  God  tells  you  to  go  
somewhere, go. If God tells you to turn the stones into bread, do that. And 
if God tells you to join some other church, do that. But wait for God to 
speak. That is the important thing.
Now I want to show you something good about Abraham. I am mention-
ing  these  things  just  to  show  you  that  Abraham  was  an  ordinary  man  
just  like  all  of  us.  We  shouldn’t  be  discouraged  by  our  failures.  In  13:7 
we read that there was strife between Abraham’s servants and Lot’s serv-
ants. Abraham and Lot obtained vast wealth through their trip to Egypt 
and now that wealth causes problems. Wealth always causes problems. 
Lot and his wife were affected by what they saw in Egypt. They wanted 
to make more money. But Abraham was a man who would not fight with 
anybody. But his servants fought.
“There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the 
herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were 
dwelling  there.”  Why  is  that  last  sentence  included  there?  Because  
those heathen people were watching this fight. This is very relevant 
to  the  situation  in  today’s  Christendom  too.  The  heathen  are  dwell-
ing in the land and what do they see? Christian groups fighting with 
each other. And in the midst of all this can we find a godly man like 
Abraham today who will call Lot (the worldly person who loves money) 
and say to him, “Let there be no strife between you and me (verse 8), 
we are brothers”? They were not brothers. Abraham was the uncle, Lot 
was his nephew. See the graciousness of this 75-year-old man to his 
35-year-old nephew. “We are brothers!” A godly man is a humble man. 
He was 75 years old, but he could look at his young nephew and say, 
“We are brothers. You are equal to me. I will give you first preference. 
Choose what you want.” Jerusalem is built by such men. Christendom 
needs such leaders – and they are not easily found.
Today,  we  have  many  leaders  who  assert  their  authority,  who  would  
have said, “I am 75 years old, I am your uncle. I am the one whom God 
called, not you. You just came along with me.” But Abraham did not speak 
like that to Lot. He said to Lot, “If you go to the right, I’ll go to the left. And 
if you go to the left, I’ll go to the right. You take what you want first.” And 
Lot, greedy man that he was, with the spirit of Babylon, grabbed first. He 
looked at the lovely fields of Sodom, saw the opportunity to make money 
there, and the rich people who lived there, and said, “I’ll move there and 
serve God there as well.”

Many Christian preachers migrate to wealthy countries and to preach 
in wealthy churches because they love money. But invariably, they lose 
out spiritually. I have seen that happen again and again. Do you go some-
where because God led you there or because money attracts you? 
When  Abraham  was  taking  this  decision,  the  Lord  had  come  down  
(as in Babel), to see what he and Lot were doing. And the Lord saw the 
godly  way  in  which  Abraham  conducted  himself.  Immediately  after  Lot  
had left him, the Lord said something very important to Abraham (verses 
14–17). God separated him first from his father (by death), and then He 
separated  Abraham  from  yet  another  relative  (who  would  have  been  a  
hindrance to him through his covetousness). 
The Lord said, “Now you are alone and now I can get you to go where 
I want you to go and to be what I want you to be. I saw exactly what 
happened” Do you know that God watches every transaction that takes 
place  between  people?  He  watches  our  attitudes.  Have  you  given  up  
your right to something because you are a Christian? God says to you, 
“I have taken note of that.”
Then God said to Abraham, “Just stand here and look north, south, 
east, west. All the land that you can see will one day belong to your chil-
dren. I promise that. It will not belong to the descendants of Lot. God said 
that to Abraham 4000 years ago. Look at that land today 4000 years later 
and ask yourself who is living there. The descendants of Abraham, not 
the descendants of Lot. God keeps His word. Thousands of years may go 
by, but if God has said to Abraham, “I will give this land to your descend-
ants forever,” (verse 15), then it will be exactly like that.
Then  we  see  in  Chapter  14  how  Lot  got  into  trouble.  You  always  get  
into trouble when you go outside the will of God. He was captured by his 
enemies. Abraham could have said, “Serves him right. The fellow grabbed 
something from me.” But Abraham didn’t react like that. There you see 
another time that Abraham was tested: What would Abraham’s attitude 
be, when he hears that this man who cheated him, has got into trouble? 
When somebody who has cheated you gets into trouble himself, then you 
will discover very quickly whether you are a man of God – or not. Abraham’s 
reaction was, “Let me go and help Lot. It’s true that Lot cheated me. But 
what did he cheat me of? Some garbage of earthly wealth. That’s nothing. 
I’ve got heavenly riches. I feel sorry for Lot because he went after earthly 
things, and now he has got into trouble. Let me go and help him.” And 
Abraham  went  and  delivered  Lot  himself.  That’s  the  attitude  of  a  godly  
man. Only such people can build Jerusalem.
On his way back from the battle, Abraham was exhausted, and possi-
bly  proud  as  well  of  the  fact  that  with  just  318  servants  he  went  and  
destroyed  the  many  armies  of  so  many  kings.  He  was  also  in  danger  
of  collecting  all  that  wealth  that  he  had  accumulated  through  winning

Genesis
this battle. In those days if you won a battle all the gold and silver of the 
enemy’s was yours. At that time God sent a servant of His to Abraham. 
Isn’t  it  wonderful  to  see  that?  An  unknown  man  named  Melchizedek,  
who was living out there in the desert, was in touch with God. You read 
about him in 14:18.
The reason why Melchizedek is important is because in Psalm 110:4, 
Jesus is called a Priest after the order of Melchizedek. And in Hebrews 7 
that is confirmed. The only place in Scripture where Melchizedek comes 
is in 14:18–20 – three verses, that’s all. Melchizedek appears, fulfils his 
ministry  and  disappears.  And  God  said  to  his  Son,  “You  are  a  Priest  
forever  after  the  order  of  Melchizedek.”  Not  a  priest  after  the  order  of  
Levi – the old covenant priesthood. How did this man Melchizedek, who 
appears in only three verses in the Bible become so important? It is good 
for us to know the reason.
First of all he was king of Salem (14:18) – Jerusalem. Jerusalem, we 
have seen, is a picture of the true church, the opposite of Babylon. Jesus 
is the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek in this church, 
and we are to be priests according to the same order. Jesus is King in 
Jerusalem,  and  we  are  called  to  be  kings  too.  Our  Lord  has  made  us  
kings and we shall reign on this earth. We are called to rule over sin and 
we are called to rule over our passions. 
What did Melchizedek do? He first of all brought food for Abraham and 
for his 318 servants. Christianity is practical. If a man is exhausted, 
what  he  needs  is  food,  not  a  sermon!  There  is  nothing  unspiritual  
about providing food to a hungry man. That is the most spiritual thing 
you can do for him. When Elijah was exhausted, an angel came from 
heaven  and  gave  him  food  twice (1  Kings  19:6–8).  After  Jesus  rose  
up  from  the  dead,  when  He  saw  His  disciples  one  morning,  coming  
back exhausted from a whole night’s fishing, He kept food ready for 
them  (John  21:9).  That  is  true  spirituality,  to  help  others  with  food  
and material things, where there is a need. That is the first part of the 
priesthood of Melchizedek.
It goes on to say that Melchizedek then blessed Abraham (14:19). He 
did  not  criticise  Abraham.  There  is  no  accusative  spirit  in  the  order  of  
Melchizedek.  No.  Only  blessing.  And  how  did  he  bless  him?  He  said,  
“Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth.” He 
reminded  Abraham  that  his  God  owned  the  heaven  and  the  earth  and  
that therefore he should not take the little gold and silver that he won 
in  the  war.  He  was  trying  to  save  Abraham  from  being  covetous.  Then  
he said, “Blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into 
your hand.” Thus he reminded Abraham that it was God Who had given 
him the victory, thus saving him from pride.

Jerusalem – Abraham and Melchizedek                                                                                                 25
Genesis
How  did  Melchizedek  know  that  Abraham  had  these  three problems 
–  that  he  was  exhausted  and  needed  food,  that  he  was  in  danger  of  
covetousness and of pride? How did his ministry fulfil these three needs 
exactly. Melchizedek’s ministry was like arrows that went straight to the 
centre of the target. His secret was that he was a man who had the habit 
of  listening  to  God  every  day.  He  did  not  live  by  his  bright  ideas  but  
by  God’s  Word.  This  is  the  secret  of  all  prophetic  ministry  that  meets  
people’s needs exactly.
When Melchizedek was waiting on God one day as usual, God told him, 
“Get up. Take a large quantity of food for about 400 people. And take this 
two sentence message with you and give it all to a servant of Mine, whom 
you have never met, who is travelling on such-and-such a road.” Like Philip 
went to meet the Ethiopian eunuch on the road to Gaza, Melchizedek got 
up and went, not knowing whom he was going to meet. When he went to 
the place God told him of, he met Abraham. He gave him the food and gave 
him the message – and then went off back home. What a ministry – bless-
ing people and then disappearing, without waiting around to receive a gift 
or appreciation. The priesthood of Melchizedek is one that ministers and 
disappears.  Jerusalem  is  built  through  such  priests.  These  are  the  true  
kings of Jerusalem today.
One  day  God  took  Abraham  outside  his  tent  and  told  him,  “Look 
towards the heavens and see if you can count the stars there. That’s how 
many descendants you are going to have” (15:5). At that time Abraham 
didn’t even have one child. There are millions of stars in the sky. And it 
says that Abraham believed the Lord (verse 6). The word ‘believe’ there in 
the original Hebrew is ‘aman’ from which we get the English word ‘Amen’ 
which means ‘I believe that it will be so.’ So when God told Abraham that 
his seed would be like the stars of heaven, Abraham just said, “Amen. 
I  believe it will be so.” That’s it. And it was fulfilled. Today, the children of 
Abraham (physically and spiritually) number in millions.
Faith  means  saying  “Amen”  when  God  has  said  something  to  you.  
Faith is always based on the word of God. “Faith comes by hearing and 
hearing by the word of God” (Romans 10:17). You can’t have faith, if you 
don’t listen to God. Abraham heard God first. Then he said “Amen”.
Nowadays, I find many believers saying that they have faith for things 
about  which  God  has  said  nothing.  They  say:  “I  have  faith  that  God  
will give me a Mercedes-Benz car. And I believe it’s going to be black 
in  colour.”  That’s  not  faith.  That  is  presumption. It  is  tempting  God. 
Faith  can  be  born  only  after  hearing  God  speaking  to  us  first.  Only  
then can we say, “Amen. It shall be so.” If you remember this, you will 
be saved from presumption and from “counterfeit faith”. Faith begins 
with God’s promise and not with our desires. That which begins with 
our own desires will only lead to Babylon. What begins with God will 
lead  to  Jerusalem.  Once  God  has  spoken,  we  must  keep  on  saying,  

26 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
“Amen” to it, all through our life, no matter how long God takes to fulfil 
His Word..
But in Chapter 16, we read that Sarah was impatient. She suggested 
to Abraham to have children through Hagar, her maid (16:2). What did 
Abraham  do  then?  Unfortunately  he  said,  “Amen”,  to  Sarah  too.  That  
caused  a  problem  for  Abraham’s  descendants  that  has  now  lasted  for  
4000 years. 
What are we to learn from this incident? Just this that we must never 
say “Amen” to man’s word, when God has told us something else. God 
can  solve  any  problem  we  have,  without  our  having  to  adopt  carnal  
methods. We don’t need Sarah’s advice. God is well able to do what He 
has promised. 
Thus Ishmael was born (16:15). Notice something here. When Ishmael 
was  born,  Abraham  was  86  years  old.  The  next  verse  carries  on  from  
when Abraham was 99 years old (16:16 & 17:1). What happened during 
those  13  years?  The  Lord  was  silent.  The  Lord  appeared  to  Abraham  
again only when he was 99, after a silence of 13 years. It is as if the Lord 
was  saying  to  him,  “Did  you  say  ‘Amen’  to  Sarah’s  suggestions?  Then  
you will have to learn a painful lesson. I won’t speak to you for 13 years, 
until  you  learn  to  value  My  voice  more  than  anyone  else’s.”  Yes,  God  
is very strict. He teaches us some lessons in a very hard way at times 
–   for otherwise the lesson won’t sink in. 13 years is a long time to live 
without hearing God. But Abraham learnt his lesson by then and never 
consulted Sarah again – not even when he was told to sacrifice Isaac 
much later. 
God did not give up on Abraham. He now told him, “Your name will no 
longer  be  called  Abram (exalted  father)  but  your  name  will  be  Abraham 
(father of a multitude). You won’t just have that name; you will actually be 
the father of a multitude.” Abraham said, “Amen” once again – and within 
a  year,  he  got  a  son  –  when  things  appeared  hopeless.  God  gave  him  a  
son because he finally learnt to say, “Amen” to God alone. Abraham had 
learnt his lesson. 
God  also  told  him  at  this  time  to  circumcise  every  male  member  of  
his  household.  Circumcision  under  the  old  covenant  was  a  cutting  off  
of the flesh. Under the new covenant, it symbolized “no confidence in the 
flesh”. “We are the true circumcision, who have no confidence in the flesh” 
(Philippians  3:3).  God  was  telling  Abraham,  “You  must  not  depend  on  
yourself. Trust in Me.”
We read a little bit about Abraham’s hospitality in Chapter 18. We’re told 
in Hebrews 13:2 to be hospitable to strangers, “because some have thus 
entertained  angels  without  knowing  it”.  That  is  referring  to  Chapter  18. 
A godly man is always hospitable, warm and good – even to strangers.

Jerusalem – Abraham and Melchizedek                                                                                                 27
Genesis
Then in Chapter 18 and 19, we read of Lot getting into trouble again. The 
Lord told Abraham that He was going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for 
its sins. Again Abraham was concerned about Lot. Lot still hadn’t learnt 
a lesson. After being captured as an enemy, he went back to Sodom to 
make  more  money.  But  Abraham  didn’t  judge  Lot.  As  a  godly  man,  he  
prayed for Lot to try and save his life. This is the first recorded interces-
sion in the Bible and it is for the salvation of souls. Lot was saved as a 
result of Abraham’s prayers. But his wife was left behind as a pillar of 
salt. Jesus referred to this when He said that at His second coming, two 
would be in one bed (husband and wife), and only one would be taken up. 
The other would be left behind (Luke 17:32, 34). 
Lot’s is a sad story. He lost his wife and both his sons-in-law, and all 
his property, in his pursuit of wealth. Finally, he had to go as a pauper 
to the very place where God had told him to go in the first place! His 
daughters then committed incest with him and bore two sons – Ammon 
and Moab (19:37, 38). From them came the Ammonites and the Moabites 
who fought with Israel constantly. 
In contrast to the way Lot brought up his children, we read the Lord 
Himself  testifying  concerning  Abraham  that  Abraham  would  “command 
his children to keep the way of the Lord” (18:19). God also said there that 
this was why He could fulfil all His promises for Abraham. God cannot do 
much for many people today, because they cannot control their children 
in their own home!
In Chapter 20, we see Abraham failing a second time in the same area 
of telling  lies  to  a  heathen  king  in  order  to  save  his  life.  He  was  even  
willing to allow his wife to go to bed with another man to save his own life. 
How weak a man he was – just like us. But God was good to Abraham 
and saved Sarah from being touched by Abimelech. It is interesting to see 
that God praises a heathen king for “the integrity of his heart” (20:6). God 
told him that it was the integrity of his heart that made God stop him 
from committing adultery with Sarah. God will help any young man who 
has integrity of heart today, in the same way as He helped that heathen 
king 40 centuries ago!
We see something wonderful in 20:17–21:2. We see Abraham praying 
here for many barren women in Abimelech’s household, at a time when 
his  own  wife  Sarah  was  barren.  It  requires  much  largeness  of  heart  to  
pray that others might get what we ourselves have not received from God. 
But when Abraham prayed like that, not only did all those women receive 
children, barren Sarah also conceived and gave birth to Isaac. “He who 
waters  others  will  be  watered  also  himself  (by  God)”  (Proverbs  11:25). 
When Job prayed for others, God blessed those others and Job as well 
(Job 42:10).
But Abraham had waited patiently for 25 years before he got what God 
had promised him. King Abimelech now heard of Isaac’s birth and came 
to Abraham and told him, “God is certainly with you” (21:22). When we 

28 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
are faithful to the Lord, the Lord will make even the heathen recognise 
that He is with us.
In Chapter  22, we read of the first time in the Bible that God testi-
fies about a man saying, “Now I know that you fear Me.” That was when 
Abraham offered up Isaac. Abraham was about 125 years old at this time, 
and God tested him again. This time it was to see whether Abraham still 
loved God supremely, as at the beginning. God told him, “Sacrifice your 
son Isaac. I am not asking you to do it tomorrow morning. No. Do it on 
Mount Moriah – three days journey away. Take those three days to think 
about it.” God never asks us to do anything in a hurry. Abraham walks 
for three days and counts the cost and lays Isaac on the altar, and says, 
“Lord, here You are. I love You more than my dearest earthly possession.”
That showed Abraham’s dedication and Isaac’s dedication too. Isaac, 
as  a  25-year-old  young  man  was  much  stronger  than  125-year-old  
Abraham. Abraham would never have been able to tie Isaac on the altar if 
Isaac had not been willing. That shows how Abraham had taught his son 
to obey him. Blessed is the man who can bring up his children in such a 
way that even if he were to say to them, “I am going to offer you to God 
now. Lie down here,” they will lie down and say, “OK, Dad. Go ahead.” 
You can be certain that such a father is a godly man indeed. 
Abraham called this an act of “worship” to God (22:5). This is the first 
time that the word “worship” occurs in the Scriptures – and this is what 
true worship is. The Father seeks for such worshippers even today.
God saw Abraham’s devotion to Him and said, “Now I know that you 
fear  Me”  (22:12). The first time it is recorded in Scripture that a  man  
feared  God  is  when  a  man  obeyed  God  totally  saying,  “God,  I  love  You  
more than my dearest earthly possession”. Abraham had left Ur 50 years 
earlier because he had loved God more than his own family members. 50 
years later, his love for God had not waned even slightly. It was through 
such a man that Jerusalem began. What an example to follow! Blessed 
are you if you can go this way all the days of your life.
Abraham  named  this  place  “Jehovah  Jireh” –  the  Lord  will  provide  
(22:14). That is a word we can think of whenever we face any problem in 
life, for His promise is, “God shall provide all your need” (Philippians 4:19).
It was here on Mount Moriah that Abraham caught a glimpse of the 
heart of God Who would one day offer His Son as a sacrifice 2000 years 
later.  Jesus  referred  to  this  in  John  8:56:  “Abraham  rejoiced  to  see  My  
day and he saw it and was glad”. God was so delighted with Abraham’s 
attitude here, that he commanded the temple to be built on this very spot 
1000 years later (2 Chronicles 3:1). Yes, God’s house is built even today 
by those who fear and worship God like Abraham did.
Before Abraham finished his life, we read in Chapter 24 of his concern 
for his son. He sent his servant to go and find a bride for his son. There are 

Jerusalem – Abraham and Melchizedek                                                                                                 29
Genesis
many  marriages  mentioned  in  Scripture,  but  only  two  marriages  that  
we see clearly as being God-ordained. One was Adam’s. Eve was defi-
nitely God’s choice. The other was Isaac’s marriage. Rebekah was God’s 
choice  too.  People  ask  me,  “Do  you  believe  in  arranged marriages?” 
“Yes,”  I  tell  them,  “I  believe  in  marriages  arranged  by  God!”  God  may  
arrange  it  through  one’s  parents  (as  in  Isaac’s  case)  or  apart  from  
parents (as in Adam’s case). The thing that matters is that it must be 
arranged by God. 
If you are a godly father, you will have a concern for your children’s 
marriages. If you as a young man are fortunate enough to have a godly 
father, I would say that you should take his advice very seriously. If such 
a godly father says “No,” to the one you want to marry, wait. God may 
be testing you there. Your father’s “No” may only be for a time. After God 
sees that you are willing to respect your godly father’s advice, He will give 
you the partner He has chosen.
Abraham sending his servant to find a wife for Isaac is a picture of 
God the Father sending His Holy Spirit to earth to pick a bride for His 
Son Jesus Christ. That is what is happening in the world today as the 
gospel is preached. Read that chapter, and you will find some beautiful 
analogies. 
One of the tests that the servant applied was to find out whether the 
girl would be willing to offer water to his camels. You know that camels 
drink a lot of water. What Abraham’s servant wanted to find out was 
whether  the  girl  was  a  gracious,  hard-working  girl.  And  Rebekah  was  
such a girl. She was also a modest girl, for it is clear from Chapter 24:16, 
that she had no interest in gazing at strangers, like Abraham’s servant 
who was at that well. She had filled her jar with water and was about to 
go home, when Abraham’s servant made his request. That is the type of 
wife you need. 
And  that  is  the  type  of  bride  for  Christ  that  the  Father  looks  for  on  
earth too. God led Abraham’s servant sovereignly to the right person – 
Rebekah.  The  servant  then  took  Rebekah  on  that  long  and  dangerous  
journey of 700 kilometres (that probably took a month) all the way back 
from Mesopotamia to Canaan – a picture of our journey in this world as 
the bride of Christ.
What do you think the servant talked to Rebekah about, during that 
long journey? I am sure it was about Isaac. What do you think the Holy 
Spirit wants to talk to us about on our long journey? About Jesus. Not 
about doctrine, not about heaven, but about the Lord Jesus. And I am 
sure Rebekah herself was keen to hear about Isaac too. I want to know 
more  and  more  about  my  wonderful  Saviour,  from  the  Holy  Spirit  on  
this long journey, until the day I see Him face to face (like Rebekah saw 
Isaac). And then one day, like Rebekah, I too shall enter the tent of my 
Lord and be His wife. Do you have that longing? That is what Chapter 24 
is all about.

Genesis
The Life of Isaac
But Rebekah had a problem. For 20 years or more, she was barren (cf. 
25:20 with 25:26). Is it possible to have problems, when you get the wife 
that God Himself chose for you. Yes! That may be part of your spiritual 
education. Even when God leads you somewhere, you can face problems 
there.  Problems  don’t  indicate  that  you  are  out  of  God’s  will.  No.  They  
only  mean  that  you  have  to  pray  and  ask  God  to  solve  the  problems.  
Isaac prayed, and the problem was solved. Rebekah conceived (25:21).
Twins  were  born  to  Rebekah.  Jacob  came  out  grabbing  Esau’s  heel  
(25:26). Jacob’s grabbing nature started in the womb itself. He dashed 
for the exit to come out first but missed. Esau came out first and so he 
grabbed Esau’s heel. That was Jacob. This was the man God chose to be 
the head of the nation of Israel!! God chose a weak man to be His servant 
– a man who was interested only in furthering his own interests and in 
grabbing for earthly things. They called him ‘Jacob’ meaning ‘Grabber.’ 
What an encouragement that is for fallen sinners like us. Our Lord came 
to call sinners and not the righteous.
Isaac was not a wise person like his father Abraham was. Isaac’s home 
was filled with partiality. Isaac was on Esau’s side and Rebekah was 
on Jacob’s side. Such an attitude is the best way to split a home. Esau 
and  Jacob  became  lifelong  enemies  because  of  the  partiality  of  their  
parents. One parent favoured one son and the other parent favoured 
the other. So the two boys became jealous of each other. And no doubt 
this separated Isaac and Rebekah too. What a beautiful marriage theirs 
was  when  they  had  started  out  as  a  couple  chosen  by  God  for  each  
other and deeply in love with each other! But their partiality towards 
their  children  ruined  their  marriage  thoroughly.  The  saddest  part  is  
that the reason for this partiality, in Isaac’s case, was his love of good 
food:  He  liked  the  deer-meat  that  Esau  would  bring  home  regularly.  
Jacob was not a good hunter and so Isaac did not care for him. Isaac’s 
blessing  of  Jacob  (that  caused  so  many  problems)  also  came  about  
through  his  love  for  deer-meat.  A  glutton  like  Isaac  certainly  doesn’t  
come forth as a good father at home, like Abraham was. Godly fathers 
can at times have sons who act quite foolishly. 
We read in Chapter 26:7 of another of Isaac’s foolish acts – but here 
he  followed  in  his  father’s  lying  footsteps.  When  Isaac  was  in  Gerar,  
the men there asked him about his pretty wife, Rebekah. He told them 
that  Rebekah  was  his  sister.  That  was  the  lie  that  his  father  Abraham  
had  said  concerning  his  mother  Sarah,  on  two  occasions  (Chapters  12  
and 20). But Isaac had not learnt from his father’s mistakes. We don’t 
have to make the same mistakes that our parents have made before us. 
A  wise  man  will  learn  from  the  mistakes  of  others  so  that  he  does  not  
repeat them.

Genesis
But  to  Isaac’s  credit,  it  must  also  be  said  that  he  had  some  of  the  
good qualities of his father, when it came to dealing with people outside 
his family. We read of a time (in 26:18) when Isaac re-opened the wells 
that  his  father  had  dug  earlier  and  that  the  Philistines  had  closed  up  
out of jealousy. Those wells belonged to Abraham, because he had dug 
them.  And  so  they  now  belonged  to  Isaac.  But  the  herdsmen  of  Gerar  
quarrelled with Isaac’s servants and said, “The water is ours!” So Isaac’s 
servants went and asked Isaac, and Isaac said, “Give it to them.”. Just 
like  Abraham  gave  Lot  the  land  Lot  wanted,  Isaac  also  follows  in  his  
father’s footsteps here. Then Isaac dug another well (verse 21) and the 
Gerarites  quarrelled  over  that  one  too.  And  a  second  time,  Isaac  said,  
“Give  that  also  to  them.”  He  moved  away  from  there  and  dug  another  
well. The Gerarites were ashamed by now and did not fight for this well. 
And  so  Isaac  named  it  ‘Rehoboth’,  saying,  “At  last  the  Lord  has  made  
room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.”
Think about that phrase “Rehoboth, the Lord has made room for us.” 
Isaac did not make room for himself by pushing people out. No. He gave 
up  his  rights  and  the  Lord  made  room  for  him  and  he  became  fruit-
ful. This is the way to build Jerusalem. This stream (of giving up one’s 
rights) began with Abraham, continued with Isaac and flowed on finally 
into  Isaac’s  grandson  Joseph  many  decades  later.  This  is  the  principle  
we  must  live  by:  “I won’t fight or grab for earthly things. Let the world, 
and  worldly  Christians  have  what  they  want.  I’ll  take  what’s  left  over.  
And  from  the  leftovers,  God  will  make  room  for  me  and  I  will  be  fruitful  
in the land.” Those who grab Sodom and Gomorrah and its wealth will 
remain barren. The way of the church (Jerusalem) is the way of giving 
up one’s earthly rights, even as Jesus our Lord did. His kingdom was not 
of this world. Neither is ours. The way of Babylon however is the way of 
grabbing.
Jacob started life as a grabber and he had to be converted before he 
could became Israel and thus be in the “Jerusalem stream”. Otherwise 
he  would  have  been  in  the  “Babylon  stream”.  These  are  some  of  the  
important principles that we find in the book of Genesis that apply to us 
even today. Look at the number of believers who are seeking for position 
and honour in Christendom. The very first qualification to be a Christian 
leader (or elder) is that you have no desire to be a leader because you are 
thoroughly convinced that you are not fit to be a leader. We must allow the 
Lord to make room for us and to make us leaders. Then we will be fruitful 
in the land. If we try to make room for ourselves, we will never be fruitful. 
That is certain.
In Chapter 26:28, we read that this man who was Isaac’s enemy finally 
comes to Isaac and says, “We have seen clearly that the Lord is with you,” 
and he makes a feast for Isaac. That is God’s way. A man of God makes 
peace with his enemies. If our enemy is hungry, we must feed him. That 
is the way of the Jerusalem-stream.

32 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
In 26:34, 35, we read: “When Esau was 40 years old, he married Judith 
the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the 
Hittite;  and  they  brought  grief  to  Isaac  and  Rebekah.”  We  see  here  that  
Isaac was not as careful as Abraham was, to find a partner for his son. 
He allowed Esau to marry whomever he liked. He had spoilt Esau by his 
favouritism  and  partiality.  Isaac  was  more  interested  in  the  food  Esau  
brought him than in the wife whom Esau chose. These are some of the 
warnings in Scripture, for us today.
Toward the end of his life, Isaac’s eyesight began to fail. There is nothing 
serious  about  that.  As  we  grow  older  our  eyes  will  naturally  become  
weaker. But the sad thing was that Isaac’s spiritual vision also was dim 
and clouded. As we grow older, our outer man may decay. But our inner 
man  should  become  stronger  and  our  spiritual  vision  must  be  sharp.  
But Isaac’s was not. He knew what God had said when his two children 
were in Rebekah’s womb: “The older will serve the younger.” But he still 
decides  to  go  against  God’s  word  and  to  give  his  blessing  to  the  older  
brother. Can you see his folly there? He tells Esau in 27:2, 3:   “I am going 
to die soon. Go and get your bow and your quiver and get some venison 
for me.” This old man with one foot in the grave is still thinking of food!! 
No wonder he lost his spiritual vision. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9:27, 
“If I don’t subdue my body, I will preach to others and still be disqualified 
myself.” This is the reason why the word of God encourages us to fast 
from food now and then – so that we can keep our gluttonous desires and 
our sexual passions under control, so that we worship God and not our 
stomachs. It was love of food that made Isaac spiritually blind. And it is 
love of good food that has made many preachers spiritually blind too.
Isaac was saying as it were, “Esau, go and bring me this venison. If it 
is tasty I will give you God’s blessings. I know God told me many years 
ago  that  your  younger  brother  is  to  receive  the  birthright.  But  I  don’t  
care about what God said those many years ago. You have been a good 
son  to  me  and  have  always  brought  me  good  venison  to  eat.  So  I  am  
sure God will understand if I give you the blessing instead of giving it to 
your brother who never brought me a good meal in his life”!! Think of the 
depth of Isaac’s stupidity here. But God ensured that Isaac’s plan failed.
Rebekah was on Jacob’s side. Rebekah knew that God had said that 
the younger brother must get the blessing. So when she heard that Isaac 
was going to give the blessing to Esau, she schemed to help God fulfil His 
promise! She told Jacob, “Esau will take some time to get the venison. 
Meanwhile I’ll make some good, tasty curry that your Dad likes. You go 
put  on  some  animal  skin  and  pretend  to  be  hairy  Esau  and  take  the  
curry to your father.”
But did God need all of Rebekah’s clever schemes to fulfil His promise 
to  Jacob?  Rebekah  made  the  same  mistake  that  Abraham  made  with  
regard to Hagar. Abraham felt: “God needs help! It looks as if the promised 
seed will not come. I must go in to Hagar and have a son.” Here Rebekah

Genesis
says  something  similar:  “God  needs  some  help  now,  because  it  looks  
as if Esau is going to get the blessing. I must help Jacob to grab it.” Let 
me assure you that God doesn’t need our help to fulfil His promises. 
He certainly doesn’t want us to cheat and tell lies to promote His work.
Many Christians think that the end justifies the means. That means 
that if our ultimate goal is good, it doesn’t matter how we get there. But 
that is wrong. The goal must be spiritual, and the way to the goal must 
also be spiritual too. If God wants Jacob to get the birthright, the way 
he gets it must be spiritual too. In the same way: If it is God’s will that 
the gospel must be preached to every creature, then the way we do it 
must be spiritual too. We must not do evangelism or church-building 
by hook or by crook. It must be a godly way by which we reach that 
godly goal. And if as a result of choosing a godly way we find that we 
are not able to do as much as other people can do in an ungodly way, 
then so be it. But we will not compromise spiritual principles in order 
to  do  God’s  work.  It  is  better  to  spend  all  our  life  building  a  small 
little structure made of gold, silver and precious stones than to build a 
massive structure made of wood, hay and straw that will be burnt up 
in the final day!
What about you? Are you building in a godly way towards a godly goal?
Esau had despised his birthright. It says in 27:34 that when he heard 
that he had missed the blessing, “he cried out with an exceedingly great 
and bitter cry.” Now he regretted the decision he had taken many years 
earlier to sell his birthright. He had then thought that he would outsmart 
his simple-minded brother Jacob by getting the porridge from him then 
and the birthright as well later. But God outsmarted Esau finally. God 
knows  how  to  “catch  the  wise  in  their  own  craftiness”  (1  Corinthians  
3:19). He ensured that Jacob got the birthright. So let all clever schemers 
beware. You will finally reap from God what you sow now.
It says in Hebrews 12:16, 17: “Let there be no immoral or godless person 
like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal, for you know that 
afterwards when he desired to inherit the blessing he was rejected”. You 
make a choice in life when you are young. You come to a fork in the road 
when you are young, concerning moral matters especially. That is why it 
talks there about immoral people. Do you want the birthright, the eternal 
blessings, the spiritual blessings, or do you want the temporal blessings, 
the  immediate  ones,  the  bowl  of  porridge,  that  will  satisfy  your  bodily  
needs?  That’s  a  choice  that  faces  many  young  people  today  –  a  choice  
between  that  which  is  eternal,  spiritual  and  in  the  future  –  and  –  that  
which is temporary, material (physical) and available immediately.
We all come to that fork in the road often. Moses came to that, and he 
refused the pleasures of sin, the wealth of Egypt and the honour of being 
Pharaoh’s  grandson  (Hebrews  11:24–26).  And  so  God  could  use  him.  

34 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
Many of you are at that fork in the road right now. You may say, “Let me 
indulge  a  little  bit  in  these  things.  Ultimately  I  will  repent  and  get  the  
spiritual blessing too.” Let me assure you that you will not. Like Esau, 
you will only reap what you have sown. Make the right choice now for it 
says there, “See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God” (Hebrews 
12:15). May none of us fall from the grace of God and end up like Esau.
The Life of Jacob
In Chapter 28 we read of how Jacob goes away from his home. He is sent 
off  by  Rebekah  to  her  brother  Laban’s  place  to  escape  Esau’s  wrath.  
Jacob was still unmarried and probably about 70 years old at this time. 
It says in 28:11, “the sun had set.” Though that is referring only to a 
geographical fact, yet the sun had indeed set on Jacob’s life, spiritually 
speaking  too.  He  had  been  living  for  the  world,  and  had  grabbed  and  
cheated. And yet God met with Jacob in mercy and told him that He had 
a great purpose for his life. “I am the God of your father Abraham,” God 
told him, “I will give you and your descendants the land on which you lie. 
All the families of the earth will be blessed through you?” (verses 13, 14).
This  is  called  “the  blessing  of  Abraham”  (Galatians  3:14).  When  God  
called Abraham, He had told him, “I will bless you, and all the families 
of the earth will be blessed through you” (12:2, 3). God repeated it here 
to Jacob. In Galatians 3:14, we are told that this blessing becomes ours, 
when we are filled with the Holy Spirit.
What  then  is  the  purpose  of  being  filled  with  the  Holy  Spirit?  It’s 
certainly not that we might speak in tongues! That’s just one of the gifts 
that God gives to some of His children. Unfortunately a lot of Christians 
have made too much of that. But that’s not the main purpose. The main 
purpose is not even physical healing. Paul was never healed from a “thorn 
in his flesh”. The primary purpose of the fullness of the Holy Spirit is that 
God might bless us and thus make us a blessing to every family that we 
encounter on the face of the earth (Galatians 3:14).
When God fills us with the Holy Spirit, we will be a blessing to all people. 
No-one will be able to meet us without being blessed in some way! It’s 
like these heavily-perfumed ladies. You can smell their perfume even 
when  you  are  a  few  feet  from  them!  Anywhere  they  go,  people  smell  
their perfume. So will it be with us. If we enter a home we will bless 
that home, whether we visit it for five minutes or five days. That is “the 
blessing  of  Abraham” – rivers of living water flowing with blessing to 
thirsty people everywhere.
God  said  to  Jacob  that  night,  “That’s  My  calling  for  you.  I  am  with  
you.” When God fills us with the Holy Spirit, He Himself will be with us 
(verse 15). He told Jacob, “I am with you, I will keep you, I will bring you

back and I will not leave you until I have done for you what I have prom-
ised.” Jacob woke up, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none 
other than the house of God – Bethel – the gate of heaven!” 
But  now  see  how  he  responded  to  this  fantastic  promise  from  God.  
He says effectively (in verse 20), “Lord, I am not interested in all those 
things. Just take care of me on this journey, give me enough food to eat 
and clothes to wear, and protect me from accidents and robberies along 
the  way.  Bring  me  safely  back  to  my  father’s  house.  That’s  all  I  want.  
I  am  not  interested  in  being  a  blessing  to  all  the  families  of  the  earth.  
If you give me these material blessings I have asked for, I will give You 
tithes of all my earnings, and build a house for You. Bless my business, 
Lord, and I promise You, I will give you 10% of all my profits.”
That  unfortunately  is  the  response  of  many  Christians  to  God  today  
too. God wants His children to be filled with the Spirit and to have the 
blessing of Abraham so that they become a blessing wherever they go. But 
what are the prayers of most Christians like? They pray saying, “Lord, 
give me a comfortable job with a large salary. Heal me of my sicknesses. 
Help me to build a good house for my family. Get my children married to 
rich, good-looking partners. And protect us from all dangers. And we will 
give you a percentage of all our earnings”!! 
Is that what God has called us for? Many Christians have missed God’s 
best,  because  they  settle  for  earthly  blessing,  when  God  has  called  
them  to  “every  spiritual  blessing  in  the  heavenly  places”.  They  settle  
for  something  material  and  temporary  when  God  has  called  them  to  
inherit  spiritual  and  eternal  blessings.  God  doesn’t  want  us  to  have  
any regrets in eternity. But many are exactly like Jacob. The sun has 
indeed set on such believers too.
Jesus referred to the ladder that Jacob saw here as a picture of Himself. 
Jesus is the ladder from earth to heaven (John 1:51). And we can praise 
God that the foot of that ladder came right down and touched the earth 
instead of hanging some distance above our heads! Jesus was “made like 
us in all things” so that He might be our High Priest (Hebrews 2:17).
But God did not leave Jacob. He was determined to break him in order 
to bless him. But how does God do that? He allows Jacob to deal with a 
craftier person than himself – Laban. Jacob who had cheated his father 
and his brother now finds someone who cheats him.
It’s interesting to see how Laban cheated Jacob in getting him married 
to Leah instead of to Rachel. In those days they used to have a big feast 
before the wedding. So Laban, crafty man that he was, said, “Let’s have 
the wedding at night” – so that people’s faces would not be clear. Then he 
got Jacob thoroughly drunk at the feast, so that Jacob would not know 
what  was  happening  around  him.  Laban  then  put  Jacob’s  hand  into  
the hand of a heavily-veiled girl and asked Jacob if he would marry her. 

36 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
Jacob imagining it was Rachel said “Yes” and got married! The night was 
dark and he could not see the face of his bride who lay next to him in 
his tent. When he woke up the next morning he discovered it was Leah! 
Jacob had met his match in Laban and been outsmarted at last! And he 
had worked seven years for his wife!
He  now  tells  Laban,  “I  wanted  Rachel.”  Laban  says,  “Sorry.  Around  
here, we have to marry off the older girl first. If you want Rachel, you’ll 
have to work another seven years for me.” And Jacob had to say “OK”. 
That was how God began breaking Jacob’s human strength.
There  is  a  beautiful  verse  here  that  blessed  my  heart  when  I  was  a  
young believer. In 29:20, we read: “Jacob worked seven years for Rachel 
and it seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her.” It wasn’t 
a desk job that Jacob had. It was hard work in the fields, looking after 
sheep. He had to work in the hot sun during the day and sleep outside in 
the cold at night. He even lost his health. But yet it says that he felt the 
seven years were just like a few days for him – because Jacob’s love for 
Rachel was so passionate and so strong. 
And I thought, “If Jacob could serve like that for a woman, how should 
I be serving the Lord who loved me and gave His life for me?” Today I can 
testify, after 56 years of serving the Lord, that all these years have been 
just like a few days for me. Nothing can equal the joy of serving the Lord, 
when we serve Him out of love, and do not seek for money, or honour, or 
comfort, or fame. 
Do you find your labour for the Lord heavy? It’s because you don’t love 
the Lord with all your heart. 
Chapter 30. Finally Jacob begins to cheat Laban in return and to steal 
his sheep by crooked methods. When he has amassed enough wealth, he 
plans one day to leave secretly (Chapter 31). Then he hears that Esau is 
coming to meet him. He is scared, because he imagines that Esau must 
be coming to kill him. But we see something wonderful in Chapter 32. 
Even though Jacob was still the same old grabber and schemer after 20 
years, yet the angel of God met him on his way. None of us would have 
wasted our time with such a selfish man. Which earthly company would 
employ a man after seeing him deceive them and ignore their orders for 
20 years? Every earthly company would dismiss such a man. But God 
did not dismiss Jacob. And He doesn’t dismiss you or me either, despite 
our numerous failures. He still comes and meets us through his messen-
gers. Praise God for that. 
The word ‘angel’ can also be translated as ‘messenger.’ When God sends 
a messenger across your path, it’s a mark of His love for you. When God 
gives up on you, one mark of it will be that He does not send you any 
more of His messengers with a message. God sends His messengers to

Genesis
us to show us His love, especially when we are going to encounter some 
danger or evil. 
When Jacob heard that Esau was coming, he schemed as to how he 
could escape. He put the three wives whom he did not like, right up in 
front. And he put Rachel and himself right at the back – so that even if 
all the others got killed, he and Rachel would escape! Jacob is still the 
same old selfish person he always was. It’s a great encouragement for us 
to see that God picked up such a selfish man and transformed him into 
an ‘Israel’. 
We then read how God met with Jacob, wrestled with him and dislo-
cated his hip. He does drastic things in order to bring us to the place He 
wants us to be. He broke him and said, “From now on you are going to be 
a prince of God (Israel).” (32:28). When could God call him “Israel”? Only 
after 60 or 70 years of struggling with him and finally dislocating his hip 
and breaking him thoroughly. Then God says, “Let me go now”.
And at last Jacob says, “I will not let You go unless You bless me.” This 
man  who  had  spent  his  life  grabbing  money,  grabbing  the  birthright,  
grabbing  property,  grabbing  women  and  grabbing  sheep,  now  leaves  
everything and grabs hold of God. He says, as it were, “God, I have lived 
for  money,  women,  property  and  many  earthly  things.  But  I  want  You  
alone now.” God is waiting for that day to come in our lives too. Then He 
will say to us as He said to Jacob, “You will no longer be called a grabber 
or a deceiver (Jacob). You will be called a prince of God (Israel) because 
you have striven with God and have prevailed. 
When did Jacob become an overcomer? When his hip was broken. This 
is a great truth that we see right from the beginning of Scripture: God has 
to break us before He can empower us. 
It is the broken man who leans upon his staff like Jacob, who becomes 
the prince of God, and not the great, mighty ‘Mr. Universe.’ God has to 
break you, dear brothers and sisters, before He can make you what He 
wants you to be.
And then we read these wonderful words in Chapter 32:31, “Then the 
sun rose.” Again a geographical fact – but true spiritually in Jacob’s life 
as well. Twenty years earlier the sun had set on him. Now the sun rose.
Chapter 34. Jacob had 12 sons and a daughter, Dinah. And Dinah got 
him into a lot of trouble, when she decided one day to take a walk all by 
herself in an area filled with immoral men. This chapter has a warning 
for all young girls, because there are many such immoral men today as 
well. All young girls should read this and see the problems that Dinah 
caused  for  herself  and  her  father.  She  thought  she  could  take  care  of  
herself among immoral people. But someone caught her and raped her. 
Her brothers then went out and murdered all the men in his city. And 
Jacob’s name began to stink in that area – all because one girl decided 
to wander off in an immoral area on her own. She who has ears to hear, 
let her hear.

38 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
Chapter 35. The Lord now told Jacob to go back to Bethel. In a sense, 
it was Jacob’s fault too that he got into all these problems. Because if he 
had gone straight back to Bethel after God had met with him in Peniel, 
this  sad  and  violent  interlude  (in  Chapter  34)  would  never  have  taken  
place.
The Life of Joseph
Let us now look at Joseph’s life. He was the eleventh of Jacob’s twelve 
sons. We see Jacob making the same mistake here that his father had 
made before him. He too shows partiality to Joseph! Chapter 37:3: “Israel 
loved  Joseph  more  than  all  his  sons,  because  he  was  the  son  of  his  old  
age;  and  he  made  him  a  vari-coloured  tunic.” The  best  way  to  destroy  
your children is by being partial to one of them, by giving a special gift to 
one of them that you don’t give the others. Jacob had already seen what 
partiality had done in his own father’s home. Yet he repeats it in his own 
home. The result was that the ten older sons became jealous of Joseph 
and almost killed him. Partiality can have very serious consequences.
When parents praise one child in the presence of the other children, 
what is the result? The other children become enemies of the favourite 
child – sometimes, for life. Whose fault is it? The fault of foolish parents. 
There are warnings in Scripture for every area of our life. 
In 37:18. We read how Joseph’s elder brothers plotted to kill him. And 
we see the sovereignty of God here in making one of the brothers stop 
that plan and change it to selling Joseph off to some slave traders who 
were passing by at that time. Who sent those slave traders there at that 
time? God. God timed the travel of those Ishmaelite slave traders such 
that  they  would  land  up  there  exactly  when  Joseph  was  about  to  be  
killed.  And  those  slave  traders  were  going  to  Egypt,  which  was  exactly  
where God wanted Joseph to go!! It is wonderful to see the sovereignty 
of  God  at  work  again  and  again  in  Joseph’s  life.  God  has  a  plan  and  
purpose for your life too, and nobody can frustrate it. Not your jealous 
brothers and not your foolish father, nobody. That’s what we see here.
By  the  time  Joseph  was  17,  God  had  already  revealed  to  Joseph  in  
dreams that he had a purpose for his life. It is wonderful when a young 
man is so sensitive to God that at an age when most teenagers have filthy 
dreams,  he  has  dreams  from  God!  Young  people,  don’t  ever  complain  
that older brothers are not giving you an opportunity to serve God. If you 
sincerely  submit  to  God,  no-one  can  mess  up  God’s  plan  for  your  life.  
When I was young, some elder brothers, who were jealous of my preach-
ing-gift, would not allow me to share the Word in the church I attended. 
So  I  preached  the  gospel  on  the  streets  where  I  did  not  need  anyone’s  
permission  to  preach!  In  the  church  meetings,  God  told  me  to  humble  
myself and keep quiet, and never to criticise the elders. Those were the 
years when God broke me like He broke Joseph. But none of those elders

could  hinder  God’s  plan  for  my  life.  When  the  time  came,  God  opened  
doors for me and His plan for my life was fulfilled. I say that for your 
encouragement. So don’t ever complain against people. The only person 
who can mess up God’s plan for your life is you yourself. Remember that.
God  used  the  jealousy  of  Joseph’s  brothers  to  fulfil  His  plan  for 
Joseph’s life by getting them to sell him off to Egypt. God makes the evil 
that others plan against us to work for our good and for the fulfilment 
of  His  purposes.  Hallelujah!  If  God  protected  us  against  the  evil  that  
other people try to do to us, that itself would be a great thing. But God 
does  something  even  better!  He  makes  the  very  evil  that  others  do  to  
us to fulfil His plan for our life! Isn’t that much better, when God turns 
the tables on Satan like that? Just think: If Joseph’s brothers were not 
jealous of him but were good to him instead, Joseph might never have 
gone to Egypt. How did Joseph go to Egypt? Step One: His brothers were 
jealous of him. Step Two: They sold him off to some slave-traders. Step 
Three: The slave traders took him to Egypt and sold him off there. Thus 
God’s plan to take Joseph to Egypt was fulfilled! So, some of the evil 
things that others are doing to harm you will ultimately only fulfil God’s 
plan  for  your  life  –  if  you  love  God  (Romans  8:28).  You  may  face  a  few  
trials. Joseph had a tough time as a slave too. But it fulfilled God’s plan 
for his life. Praise the Lord!
A man of faith will say, “The God of Joseph is my God too. If I love God 
with  all  my  heart,  any  number  of  people  can  be  jealous  of  me,  any  
number  of  people  can  plan  evil  against  me.  But  they  will  not  hinder  
God’s plan from being fulfilled in my life.” May you have such faith in 
our wonder-working God.
Chapter  38  is  a  slight  diversion  from  Joseph’s  story.  Here  we  read  
of Judah committing adultery with his daughter-in-law, Tamar, and of 
Tamar giving birth to twins (38:29, 30). The interesting thing here is that 
it was through one of those twins – Perez – that Mary the mother of Jesus 
was born. So Jesus descended from this line of incest and adultery! Our 
Lord deliberately chose that genealogical line to come through (Matthew 
1:1–3).  Why  did  He  choose  such  a  sinful  line?  How  many  of  us  would  
have chosen an incestuous family line to come through? The Lord chose 
it  deliberately  from  heaven,  in  order  to  show  that  He  had  come  to  call  
sinners – even the incestuous – to salvation. Jesus identified with the 
worst transgressors in His family line.
Chapter  39  is  a  wonderful  story  of  a  young  man  who  was  faithful  to  
God when tempted strongly by an attractive and powerful woman. There 
is only one way to avoid immorality – and that is to run away from it (See 
1  Corinthians  6:18).  And  that  was  exactly  what  Joseph  did.  Potiphar’s  
wife pressed him to commit adultery with her (39:7). But Joseph refused. 
He  refused  to  even  be  anywhere  near  her  (verse  10).  He  did  not  just  

40 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
say,  “No.”  He  ran  away  from  the  source  of  the  temptation.  As  soon  as  
that evil lady came near him, Joseph would go off somewhere else. You 
cannot  overcome  temptation,  if  you  are  always  hanging  around  people  
who tempt you. God is looking for such men – who will run away from 
temptation.  One  day  when  she  was  alone  with  him  in  the  house,  she  
caught him. This time he pulled himself away and left her clutching on 
to his coat. This angered her so much that she accused Joseph of trying 
to rape her. Her husband was furious, and locked up Joseph in jail.
Look at the things Joseph suffered – jealousy from his brothers, false 
accusation from an evil woman, and jail. In those days jails were terrible 
dungeons with rats, worms and cockroaches crawling all over the place. 
But it says in verse 21, that in addition to all those crawling things, “the 
Lord was also with Joseph”. And that made all the difference. It doesn’t 
matter if you are surrounded by every type of inconvenience, if the Lord 
is with you. That is enough. And that was all that Joseph wanted.
There in the jail he meets Pharaoh’s cupbearer and thus gets an intro-
duction to Pharaoh. You see how God’s plan begins to work out slowly. 
It’s not just that God protected Joseph from the evil that Potiphar and his 
wife did to him. He made the evil that they did to him to work out God’s 
perfect plan. How would Joseph have ever met Pharaoh’s butler and got 
an introduction to Pharaoh if he hadn’t gone to that jail?!!
If  Joseph  could  have  seen  all  this  at  the  beginning,  he  would  have  
been praising the Lord all the while when he was in jail – just as Paul 
and  Silas  did  later.  They  could  praise  the  Lord  in  that  Philippian  jail,  
because  they  had  seen  the  sovereignty  of  God  in  the  Scriptures.  If  we  
study the Scriptures, we too will praise the Lord in every tight situation 
caused by the evil that others do to us. One day, people may put us in 
jail too, with many false accusations. I am sure the Egyptians believed 
all the false stories that had been spread about this man who was the 
most upright man in Egypt. But that didn’t bother Joseph. Many false 
stories are spread about true servants of God today too. What must we 
do? Keep quiet. Leave it to God to defend your reputation. He will vindi-
cate you at the right time. Nobody can frustrate God’s plan for your life, 
if you honour Him.
I  want  you  to  notice  how  Joseph  came  into  contact  with  Pharaoh’s  
cupbearer. Joseph had enough problems of his own to worry about in 
prison. But he forgot about his own sorrows when he saw two newcom-
ers to the prison looking sad one day. Joseph had been appointed by 
the jailer to be in charge of all the prisoners and so he asked these two 
prisoners the reason for their looking so dejected (40:7). That was how 
he interpreted their dreams correctly and thus got an opening through 
one of them (the cupbearer) to interpret Pharaoh’s dream one day. God 
has  amazing  ways  of  opening  doors  for  His  servants  who  are  faithful  
to  Him  and  who  can  forget  their  own  sorrows  and  have  a  concern  for  
others. That is what we learn from this incident. So let’s not be taken 

The Life of Joseph                                                                                                                                       41
Genesis
up with our own sorrows. Let us open our hearts to other needy people 
in this world.
Finally  Joseph  stood  before  Pharaoh.  But  that  was  in  God’s  perfect  
time.  The  Bible  says,  “They afflicted Joseph’s feet with fetters. But iron 
entered  into  his  soul  during  his  time  in  jail.  Until  the  time  appointed  by  
God, Joseph was tested. Then God’s Word came and set him free” (Psalm 
105:18, 19 - free paraphrase). God is always on time. He is never late. 
There is a specific length of time fixed by God for all our trials. During 
that  time,  He  will  test  us.  When  that  time  is  over,  He  will  command  
freedom  for  us.  But  by  then,  if  we  have  been  faithful,  iron  would  have  
entered  our  soul,  and  we  will  have  become  strong  in  faith.  God  turns  
the  tables  on  Satan  and  uses  the  very  harm  that  Satan  does  to  us  to  
strengthen us. Hallelujah!
You know the rest of the story, how his brothers were hungry for food 
because of the famine in the land, and had to come and bow down before 
Joseph, exactly as God had shown him 20 years earlier. God keeps His 
Word.
43:1, 2: When the famine was severe in the land, Jacob told his sons 
to go to Egypt and get some food. Whenever there is a famine anywhere, 
you have to go and get food from those who were wise before the famine. 
Joseph was wise in the seven years of plenty. He stored up food. Therefore 
those who were lazy in the times of prosperity had to come to him now. 
The Bible says, “Go to the ant, you lazy man, and learn from it – how it 
stores up its food in summer for the winter” (Proverbs 6:6–8).
Apply this truth spiritually: In times like these, when you have plenty of 
opportunity to study God’s Word and to become spiritually rich thereby, 
use your time wisely. Then, many years later when you don’t have much 
time  to  study  the  Word,  because  of  the  pressures  of  life,  you  will  have  
plenty of wisdom to fall back on. The wisdom from God’s Word that you 
store up now will not only satisfy you fully, you will also have plenty to 
share with others as well.
I  studied  the  Bible  earnestly,  in  my  bachelor-days,  when  I  was  an  
officer in the Indian Navy. I never went to a Bible school. I studied the 
Scriptures at the feet of Jesus. That habit also kept me away from many 
temptations. It was a time of plenty – because I had plenty of time as a 
bachelor. Once you get married and have children you won’t have that 
much free time. So if you are lazy in the years when you have plenty of 
time, you will regret it in the days of famine. Learn that lesson and apply 
it to yourself.
Joseph dealt with his brothers in a godly way. In Chapter 45:5 he says, 
“It was God who sent me before you.” Again in verse 7, he says, “God 
sent me before you.” And one again in verse 8: “God sent me.” He was 
telling his brothers, “It was not you who sold me to the Ishmaelites, it 
was God. It was not Potiphar’s wife who sent me to the jail, it was God.”. 

42 Through the Bible: Beginnings
Genesis
Blessed indeed are we if we can see God in all our ways – even in the 
evil that others do to us.
Have  you  seen  this  glorious  truth?  Don’t  ever  say,  “This  person  is  
harming me” or “That person is harming me.” It is God Who allows people 
to do things to you. 
Joseph prepared a great feast for his brothers who had once sold him 
into slavery. He also gave the best land in Egypt – the land of Goshen – to 
these brothers who had once prepared a pit for him (46:34)! Such is the 
attitude of a man of God.
We  also  see  the  tremendous  respect  that  Joseph  had  for  his  father  
(46:29). Even though Joseph was the second ruler in the world, he went 
out to meet his father and showed him respect. A godly man will always 
respect and honour his parents.
We now see Jacob in the closing years of his life as a prophet of God. 
In Chapter 47:10 he blesses Pharaoh, the greatest ruler in the world, and 
then he blesses his own sons. Joseph brings his two sons, Manasseh and 
Ephraim to Jacob and says, “Put your right hand on Manasseh’s head 
(the older boy) and your left hand on Ephraim’s (the younger one).” But 
Jacob  doesn’t  do  that.  He  crosses  his  hands  and  blesses  the  younger  
above the elder. His eyes were also dim now (like his father Isaac’s had 
been). But Jacob had spiritual vision, unlike his father: He knew whom to 
bless and whom not to. Why was that? Because Jacob had been through 
many a trial in his life, unlike his father who had lived a comfortable life. 
It is through trials that God sharpens our spiritual vision.
Jacob  was  the  first  man  to  prophesy  about  the  coming  of  Christ. 
He tells Judah his son, that the Lion of Judah would come through his 
seed, and would rule (49:9, 10).
In 50:20,  we  hear  Joseph  saying  words  similar  to  what  Paul  says  in  
Romans 8: “As for you, you meant evil against me. But God meant it for 
good”. This verse is the Romans 8:28 of the Old Testament. God makes all 
things work together for good for those who love Him.
Thus  we  come  to  the  end  of  this  wonderful  book  of  beginnings  –  
Genesis. Let us look now at the last verse of the book. Genesis began with 
the words, “In the beginning God” but it ends with the words, “a coffin in 
Egypt.” This is the result of man’s sin. 
But from that coffin in Egypt, God brought forth a wonderful redemp-
tion for fallen man!
Hallelujah!!

EXODUS
The Nation of Israel is Born
I
f Genesis is ‘The Book of Beginnings,’ we could entitle Exodus as ‘The 
Birth of a Nation’ – the nation of Israel. We saw the beginnings of this 
nation in Genesis. Now we see it as a full-fledged nation. In the first 
15 chapters we read of their slavery in Egypt and their deliverance from 
Egypt. The rest of the book deals with the giving of the Law, a little bit 
of  their  time  in  the  wilderness  and  the  plan  God  gave  for  building  His  
tabernacle.
Redemption from Egypt
In the first chapter, we read that Pharaoh was disturbed by the Israelites, 
even  though  they  were  slaves.  They  were  becoming  numerous  and  he  
was afraid that they would finally rebel against him and stop working for 
him. So he passed an order that all male children born to the Israelites 
must be killed immediately. Now that scheme originated from the devil. 
Satan has always been after the Jews to kill them – many times in human 
history. This was just the first of such occasions. 
We saw in our last study how God not only protects us from Satan’s 
plans, but does something even better: He turns the tables on Satan and 
uses Satan’s work to fulfil God’s purposes. That shows God’s almighty 
power  in  a  much  greater  way  than  if  he  merely  destroyed  Satan  or  
merely stopped Satan from working. God shows us His power not only 
by protecting us from the devil, but by using the very thing that Satan 
does to destroy him. The greatest example of this is Calvary – where 
Satan  got  Jesus’  enemies  to  crucify  Him.  But  that  cross  became  the  
very place where Satan himself was defeated!! Satan’s plan backfired 
on him – as it always has.

44 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
God turned the tables on Satan for Jesus. He will do the same for us 
too, if we live with a clear conscience in humility before Him. Whatever 
the  devil  and  his  agents  do  to  harm  us  will  be  turned  back  on  them  –  
and God’s purposes for our lives will be fulfilled. This is one of the main 
messages of the Bible – and we see it happening again and again in the 
Scriptures.
We see here that it was because Pharaoh had passed an order that all 
male babies should be killed, that Moses’ mother put Moses into a little 
basket and floated it down the river with a prayer to God. If it were not 
for that evil edict, she would never have done such a thing. But because 
she did that, Moses was picked up by Pharaoh’s daughter, and grew up 
in Pharaoh’s palace – the place where God wanted him to be trained for 
the first 40 years of his life. That could never have happened if Pharaoh 
had not passed that evil law, for then Moses would have grown up to be 
just another slave. Do you see how God’s purposes are fulfilled through 
what Satan does?
There is a great lesson here for all of us – that we see in church history 
too. Whenever  God  wants  to  do  something  for  His  people,  He  always  
begins with a man. He had to find a suitable man before He could deliver 
the  Israelites.  The  training  of  that  man  took  80  years  –  and  it  wasn’t  
academic  training  alone.  Moses  was  trained  in  the  best  academies  of  
Egypt,  but  that  did  not  qualify  him  for  God’s  work.  In  Acts  7,  Stephen  
says  that  Moses  was  mighty  in  both  word  and  deed.  He  was  a  strong  
man, and an eloquent speaker at the age of 40. He was a great military 
leader, a very rich person, and had been educated with the best educa-
tion that the most advanced country in the world could give – for Egypt 
was the world’s only superpower in those days. At the end of it all, he was 
unfit to serve God. Stephen says that Moses thought that the Israelites 
would recognise that God had raised him up to deliver them. But they did 
not recognise him as their leader. All his earthly fame and abilities could 
not prepare him for the task God had prepared for him.
Today many Christians imagine that they can serve God just because 
they have Bible-knowledge, musical ability and plenty of money. But 
they’re mistaken. They need to learn a lesson from Moses’ life: 40 years 
of the best that this world could give him could not prepare him for God’s 
service.
God had to take him through another 40 years in the wilderness, in 
a  totally  different  environment  from  the  palace,  in  order  to  equip  him.  
He had to be broken of his human strength. And God accomplished this 
by  making  him  look  after  sheep  and  by  allowing  him  to  live  with  his  
father-in-law  and  work  for  him  –  for  40  long  years.  Living  with  one’s  
father-in-law  for  even  one  year  can  be  quite  humiliating  for  a  man!  I  
know that many married women in India live with their fathers-in-law all

Exodus
their lives. But it’s different when a man has to live with his wife’s father 
and work for him as well. That can be quite a humbling experience for 
a man. But that’s how God broke Moses. You remember that that was 
how God broke Jacob too. He too had to live with his father-in-law for 20 
years. God uses fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law to break His children. 
What all the universities in Egypt could not teach Moses, he learnt in 
the wilderness, looking after sheep and working for his father-in-law. At 
the end of those 40 years, Moses is so broken that he who was once so 
eloquent and who thought he could deliver Israel, now says, “Lord, I am 
unfit. I cannot speak properly. Please send somebody else to lead your 
people.” It was then that God said, “At last you are ready. I will send you 
to Pharaoh now” (4:10–17).
What is the lesson we learn from Jacob and Moses? Just this: When 
you think you are ready, you are not. When you think you are capable, 
that you are strong, that you have knowledge, that you can speak and 
sing  and  play  musical  instruments,  and  do  wonderful  things  for  God,  
God says, “You are unfit. I have to wait until you are broken.” With Jacob 
that process took 20 years, with Moses it took 40 years, with Peter it took 
3 years, and with Paul at least 3 years. How long will it take with us? That 
depends on how quickly we learn to submit under God’s mighty hand.
How long does it take to go through school from First Standard (Grade) 
to Twelfth Standard (Grade)? 12 years – if you pass each year. But there 
are  children  who  take  16  years  to  complete  12  years  of  school.  Some  
medical students take 10 years to complete a 5-year medical course! How 
long anyone takes to finish school depends on how quickly he learns his 
lessons. It is the same in the Christian life too.
It says in 12 :40, “The time that the sons of Israel lived in Egypt was 
430 years.” However when God spoke to Abraham, He had told him that 
his  descendants  would  be  in  another  land  for  just  400  years  (Genesis 
15:13). But here we read that they were actually there for 430 years. Did 
God make a mistake? No. God is very exact in his timetable. God doesn’t 
make any mistakes. When God spoke to Abraham, His perfect will for the 
Israelites was that they should be in Egypt for 400 years. Why then did 
they stay an extra 30 years?
To find the answer to that, let us consider another example. When 
God brought the Israelites out of Egypt His plan for them was that they 
should be only 2 years in the wilderness. But how many years did they 
actually spend in the wilderness? 40 years. (See Deuteronomy 2:14). God 
may plan to break you in 2 years. But it may actually take 40 years. God 
may  want  to  begin  to  use  you  2  years  after  you  are  converted.  But  He  
may not be able to use you for 40 years. It all depends on how quickly 
you are broken. So also, God’s plan for Israel was that they should stay 
400 years in Egypt. But they had to stay for 430 years.
I  believe  the  reason  was  that  their  leader  Moses  was  not  yet  ready.  
I  believe that when Moses left Egypt at the age of 40, God had wanted to 

46 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
break him through a 10-year course with his father-in-law in the wilder-
ness,  so  that  he  could  be  ready  at  the  age  of  50  to  be  Israel’s  leader.  
But Moses did not learn his lesson in 10 years. His father-in-law had to 
humble him some more, before Moses was broken enough. It took Moses 
40 years to complete that 10-year course! Therefore the Israelites had to 
wait 30 more years. God is dependent on broken men for His work on 
earth.
This  has  a  message  and  a  warning  for  us.  God  may  have  a  plan  for  
your life. But it will never be fulfilled till you are broken. What He has 
planned  to  do  in  you  in  10  years  may  take  40  years.  So,  it  is  good  to  
be quick to humble ourselves always under God’s mighty hand – which 
refers to the circumstances He sends across our path.
Lamentations 3:27 says, “It is good for a man to bear the yoke (humble 
himself and be broken) in his youth.” Allow God to break you when you 
are young. Don’t fight against the circumstances God permits in your 
life, for that will only delay God’s plan. All your Bible knowledge, musical 
abilities  and  money  cannot  equip  you  for  God’s  service.  Brokenness  is  
essential. Jacob could become an Israel only when he was broken. Moses 
could become a leader and a prophet only when he was broken.
Chapter  2:  Here  we  read  of  the  time  when  Moses  goes  out  to  deliver  
the Israelites from the Egyptians. He sees an Egyptian beating a Hebrew 
(2:11) and he beats the Egyptian to death. Can you imagine how strong 
Moses was to kill a man just with his bare hands? If he had continued 
killing the Egyptians at this rate – one by one – how many years do you 
think  it  would  have  taken  to  kill  all  the  millions  of  Egyptians?  Moses  
would have died before all the Egyptians were killed. But when God had 
broken him by the age of 80, all Moses had to do was to lift up his rod 
over the Red Sea, and in a moment the entire Egyptian army was buried 
under the Red Sea. That’s the difference between what a man can accom-
plish in his own strength and what a broken man with God’s power can 
accomplish.
The message in the Scriptures right from the beginning is this: If you 
want to build Jerusalem, the true church, you have to be broken. You 
have to be humbled by God through circumstances and through people. 
If  you  don’t  rebel  in  those  circumstances,  God  can  do  a  quick  work  in  
you.  I  have  seen  a  lot  of  zealous  young  people  who  know  the  Bible  in  
their heads and who think they can go out and serve God. And they go 
out and serve God in their strength. Twenty or thirty years later they are 
frustrated, discouraged, critical, and blame this person and that person 
for their failures. They have accomplished nothing and wasted their lives. 
Why? Just one reason – they never allowed God to break them.
The Bible says that “the godly man’s life is exciting” (Proverbs 14:14 - 
Living). I am 76 years old now and have been a child of God for over 56 
years – and I can honestly testify that my Christian life has been exciting. 
I have been through many trials, but in all of them I have experienced 

Redemption from Egypt                                                                                                                             47
Exodus
God in exciting ways. I am excited to be able to live for God and serve 
Him. Serving the Lord is the best thing that anyone can do in this world. 
I don’t have a complaint against anyone in the whole world. Nobody has 
ever succeeded in doing harm to me so far. Many have tried to harm me 
and some of my co-workers have betrayed me. But everything they did 
has only worked for my good – as it says in Romans 8:28. So I actually 
thank  God  for  them,  because  God  used  their  evil  actions  to  make  me  
more Christ-like – that was the good that came out of their evil actions. 
God broke me in my younger days and He is still breaking me today. This 
is the way of fruitfulness. The more we are broken, the more God can use 
us to be a blessing to others.
We read in Chapter17 that it was only when the rock was smitten that 
the waters begin to flow. If the rock is not smitten, the waters will not 
flow. When the woman who brought perfume in an alabaster vial broke it 
at Jesus’ feet, only then did the sweet odour fill the house. No-one could 
smell  that  until  the  vial  was  broken.  When  Jesus  took  the  bread  and  
blessed it, nothing happened. But when He broke it, five thousand were 
fed. What is the message in all these examples? Brokenness is the way of 
blessing. When the atom is split what power is released! It can give elec-
tricity to a whole city! Imagine the power that is released when a small 
atom – so small that you can’t even see it under a microscope – is broken. 
The message in nature as well as in the Bible is just this: God’s power is 
released through brokenness. May that message grip your life.
God gripped me with that message in 1963, when I was seeking God 
for the baptism in the Holy Spirit and for His power in my ministry. God 
showed me then that the way of brokenness was the way of power. And I 
never want to forget that all my life. I want to encourage you to learn that 
lesson when you are still young.
God  made  a  promise  here  through  Moses  to  the  people.  He  told  all  
those elders and leaders of Israel (3:17), “I will bring you up out of the land 
of Egypt into the land of the Canaanites.” There were two promises there.
“I will bring you out of Egypt.”
“I will bring you into Canaan.”
Only the first was fulfilled. The second was not fulfilled for those elders 
who  heard  it.  Out  of  all  those  elders  who  heard  the  promise  of  God,  
“I   will bring you out of Egypt, I will bring you into Canaan,” none entered 
Canaan. Only half of God’s promise was fulfilled because those elders did 
not respond in faith when the time came to enter Canaan (Numbers 13). 
God’s promises are not fulfilled, until we respond in faith.  It’s  like  an  
electric switch. At a switch, two wires are connected next to each other, 
but not touching each other. The moment you put the switch on, those 
wires touch and the lights come on. God’s promise and our faith are the 
two wires. They may be very close to each other. But if they don’t touch, 

48 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
nothing  happens.  The  moment  they  touch,  power  is  released.  You  can  
hear about God’s promise and you can understand it, but it is only when 
your faith reaches out and says, “Yes, I believe that will be fulfilled in my 
life,” that it is fulfilled. Out there at the borders of Canaan, only Joshua 
and Caleb believed God’s promise, and so only Joshua and Caleb expe-
rienced it.
Chapter 4: We read here about God calling Moses. In order to encourage 
Moses and to teach him some lessons, God gave him three signs. When 
Moses  told  the  Lord,  “They  will  not  believe  what  I  tell  them,”  the  Lord  
asked him, “What is in your hand?” Note that! The Lord always begins 
with what is already in our hands. We don’t have to go looking for some-
thing that we don’t have. Elisha asked the widow, “What do you have in 
your house?” She replied “Only a jar of oil”. Elisha said, “That’s enough. 
With that pot of oil all your problems can be solved.” (2 Kings 4:2, 3). Moses 
had only his shepherd’s staff in his hand. That was enough. When God is 
with you, miracles can happen with even a shepherd’s staff. 
For the first sign, God told Moses to throw the staff down. It became a 
serpent and Moses fled from it (verse 3). The Lord said, “Don’t be scared. 
Stretch out your hand and take it by the tail.” He caught it and it became 
a staff in his hand again. What was the message there? 
First of all, that Satan is far closer to us than we think – as close as 
that staff was to Moses. Do you think Satan is far away from us? No. 
He  is  always  nearby  to  cause  misunderstandings  between  husband  
and  wife,  and  between  co-workers,  etc.  But  we  can  overcome  Satan!  
We are not to be afraid of him, for he is a defeated foe. God will crush 
him under our feet. One of the first lessons we need to learn when we 
serve the Lord is not to be afraid of Satan. Satan has got his citadels 
and  his  forts,  but  we  don’t  run  away  from  him.  We  are  to  run  away  
from temptation (2 Timothy 2:22), but Satan has to run away from us 
(James 4:7). In Jesus’ mighty Name the very thing that Satan uses to 
try and frighten us, will become a rod of authority in our hand – to split 
the seas and to lead God’s people forward.
As God’s servants we need His authority – not Bible-knowledge first, 
but Divine authority. I would rather have spiritual authority than Bible 
knowledge any day. The first thing Moses needed was authority over the 
enemy. It was Satan who was enslaving the Israelites through his servant 
Pharaoh. And Moses needed to pick him up by the tail, without any fear. 
Satan should never be able to make us afraid of him.
For  the  second  sign,  the  Lord  asked  Moses  to  put  his  hand  into  his  
bosom (verse 6). When Moses did that and took out his hand, it was full 
of leprosy. 

Redemption from Egypt                                                                                                                             49
Exodus
The  second  thing  we  need  to  understand  as  the  Lord’s  servants,  is  
that nothing good dwells in our flesh (Romans 7:18). Selfishness and 
corruption are found everywhere within our flesh. If you think that is 
not true, just put your hand inside your flesh and see! Ask God to give 
you light on the leprosy that dwells inside. If you don’t learn this impor-
tant  lesson,  you  will  go  around  condemning  people,  as  though  they  
had a flesh that was worse than yours. Nobody can commit a sin that 
we are incapable of. If we have not sinned in the same way, it is only 
because of God’s mercy and because we never faced the same intensity 
of temptation. We are no better than our fellow-human- beings. If you 
think you are better than any human being on the face of this earth, 
I want to tell you that you are totally unfit to be a servant of the Lord.
For the third sign The Lord asked Moses to pour out some water from 
the  Nile  and  it  would  turn  into  blood  (verse  9).  The  River  Nile  was  the  
precious god of the Egyptians and blood is a picture of death. 
So the spiritual meaning of this sign is that all the things of this earth 
that worldly people worship and run after, we must pour out to death. 
A servant of the Lord must be crucified to the world and the world must 
be crucified to him. The world is no longer like water to me (essen-
tial for life), but like blood that we are not even tempted to drink. We 
would rather be thirsty than drink blood. That’s the way we need to see 
everything in this world. 
These are the three essential qualifications for any servant of God. 
Now Moses agrees to go to Pharaoh. He is equipped with Divine author-
ity  and  he  goes  forth  as  a  man  whom  God  Himself  has  trained  over  a  
period of 80 years. Moses was the one man on the face of the earth at that 
time  who  was  absolutely  essential  for  God’s  purposes.  Today  God  has  
many servants. So even if one man fails him, another can do the job. But 
at that time, God had only one man – Moses. All His purposes depended 
on  that  one  man.  But  before  that  man  could  meet  Pharaoh,  he  had  to  
learn one more very important lesson. 
We  read  in  4:24  that  the  Lord  tried  to  kill  Moses  as  Moses  was  going  
to Egypt. Now if it was written there that Satan had tried to kill Moses, 
we  could  understand  that.  But  why  in  the  world  would  God  Himself  
want  to  kill  the  one  man  who  was  most  essential  for  his  purposes  on  
earth? Because there was disobedience in Moses’ own house. Moses had 
married a non-Israelite woman; and yielding to his wife’s wishes, he had 
not circumcised his son. Moses’ wife must have refused to permit that, 
and Moses, “for the sake of peace at home”, must have humbly yielded 
to  her  wishes  –  especially  since  he  was  staying  in  her  father’s  house.  
Moses’ wife was the boss in their home! But God can never permit such 
misplaced authority in the home of any of His servants. And so God told 

50 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
him, as it were, “Moses, you cannot lead Israel out of Egypt, if you cannot 
lead your own home first.”
The  Bible  says,  “If  a  man  cannot  run  his  own  home  how  can  he  run  
God’s house?” (1 Timothy 3:5). We must first be head in our own home 
before we can lead God’s people. I have seen men who claim to be serv-
ants of God who are scared of their own wives. How can such men serve 
God? If we cannot bring up our own children (when they are living in our 
home)  in  a  godly  way,  how  can  we  ever  bring  up  God’s  children  in  the  
church in a godly way?
This was such a serious matter that God was telling Moses, “Even if 
you are the most important man for Me on earth, if you don’t obey me, I 
will kill you. I cannot compromise my principles.” Moses’ wife understood 
immediately why her husband was dying. So she took a sharp stone and 
cut  off  her  son’s  foreskin  and  angrily  said  to  Moses,  “You  are  a  bride-
groom of blood to me.” Moses did one wise thing after that – he sent his 
wife home and carried on with his ministry! He did not want any more 
problems with her being around him.
You see how God is strict with His servants. He will permit other people 
to compromise in many ways. But if you are one of His choice servants, 
He will require obedience from you in the smallest of matters. He will 
look into areas of your life that He will not bother about with others. 
If you have borrowed ten rupees or a book from someone and haven’t 
yet  returned  it,  if  you  are  a  choice  servant  of  God,  He  will  keep  on  
troubling your conscience until you return it. He doesn’t deal like that 
with everyone, but only with His special servants. Most Christians are 
compromisers who live for themselves. God just leaves them alone. If 
you are a choice servant of God, He won’t allow you to write even one 
false statement in a report about your work. He will not allow you to be 
unfaithful with even one rupee. Other believers may be unfaithful with 
millions, and God will ignore them. But not with you. Do you want to 
be a choice servant of God? Do you want God to watch over you with 
such a jealous care? Then you must be willing to be rebuked by Him 
for small matters.
Such was the man who finally stood before Pharaoh. When you can 
stand before God with a clear conscience, you can stand even before the 
world’s most powerful men. For what is Pharaoh in God’s eyes, but a pile 
of dust with breath in his nostrils. God needs men like Moses in India – 
men who live before His face. Elijah told King Ahab, “I live before God’s 
face”. So he was not afraid of Ahab. 
Dear  brothers,  we  don’t  have  to  go  buttering  Cabinet  Ministers,  and  
members of parliament, like many preachers are doing today. They think 
that is the only way to survive in India today. That’s because they don’t 
know God. I agree that if you don’t know God, then that is the only way 

Redemption from Egypt                                                                                                                             51
Exodus
to survive. But that was not how Moses survived or how Elijah survived. 
They lived before God, and God backed them up. 
Do  you  want  to  be  a  servant  of  God  like  them?  Don’t  look  at  the  
preachers  you  see  in  the  world  today.  Look  at  the  servants  of  God  
in  the  Scriptures.  God  is  looking  today  for  men  who  don’t  care  for  
man’s approval, who don’t want any man’s money, who don’t seek for 
backing from any earthly authority, but who want to be backed by God 
alone.  That’s  how  Moses  stood  before  Pharaoh.  And  God  backed  up  
Moses completely.
Listen to today’s preachers. I have heard many of them. Most of them 
have  bored  me  to  death.  Can  you  say  that  such  preachers  are  being  
backed up by God, who have no anointing in their words and no author-
ity in their lives but are wishy-washy compromisers who seek to please 
men? Paul said, “If I seek to please a single man I cannot be a servant of 
Christ” (Galatians 1:10).
Don’t ever seek to please man. Seek to please God. Let men treat you 
like dirt. The apostles were treated like garbage. Jesus was treated like 
garbage. But they lived before God’s face alone, and God backed them up 
fully. That’s the only way I want to serve God.
Moses  stood  before  Pharaoh  and  God  confirmed  Moses’  word  with 
plagues  of  blood,  frogs,  lice,  insects,  livestock-diseases,  boils,  hail,  
locusts, darkness and finally the death of the eldest boy in every house 
– ten plagues in all. Some of those plagues were duplicated by the tricks 
of  the  Egyptian  magicians.  But  their  magic  tricks  failed  after  a  certain  
point (7:11; 8:7, 18). 
Religious people (who have a form of godliness without its power) have 
always  opposed  godly  men  in  every  age,  just  like  Jannes  and  Jambres  
opposed Moses (2 Timothy 3:5, 8). The religious false prophets opposed 
Elijah  and  Jeremiah  in  their  day.  And  the  religious  Pharisees  opposed  
John the Baptist and Jesus and Paul in their day.
Throughout church history, professional preachers have always stood 
against the prophets whom God has raised up in different lands. It has 
always been the same story: God raises up a man to be His prophet. And 
the professional preachers (with their titles and their degree- certificates) 
will oppose him tooth and nail. But their attacks will not make him change 
his message one bit. Ultimately, after many long years, the prophet will 
be vindicated by God Himself, like Moses was.
If you want to be a man of God, don’t ever seek to please the profes-
sional religious establishment that does not know God. The knowledge of 
God is the most important thing we need. I will respect a man whose life 
and  words  demonstrate  that  He  knows  God,  that  he  lives  before  God’s  
face and that he understands God’s ways.

52 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
In Chapter12,  we  read  about  the  deliverance  of  the  Israelites  from  
Egypt. They were told to use a bunch of hyssop and to put the blood of an 
unblemished lamb on the lintel over their door and on their door-posts, 
to escape the angel of death. That is a picture of faith applying the blood 
of  Christ  to  our  hearts.  Hyssop  was  a  common  plant  that  was  easily  
found in Egypt. Faith too is very easy to find. The Israelites left Egypt 
on the 14th day of the first month of their new calendar – and the Lord 
Jesus was crucified on the same date about 1500 years later. God looked 
into  the  future  and  saw  the  day  on  which  the  Pharisees  would  crucify  
Jesus and chose that date to deliver the Israelites from Egypt!
How were the Israelites delivered? Not by their good life or their good 
works.  God  did  not  go  checking  inside  each  house  to  see  how  each  
person  there  had  lived  during  the  previous  30  years.  No.  He  only  
checked to see if they had faith to put the blood of an innocent lamb 
on their doors. When they dipped that hyssop into the blood and put it 
on their doors, they were saying, “I am not trusting in my good works 
or my religious activities to protect me. I am trusting in the blood of 
this innocent lamb. I believe therefore that the angel of death will not 
enter my house.” That’s the way of salvation. No man can boast saying, 
“I was saved because I lived a good life.” No. The man who had lived a 
good life and the man who lived a bad life were both saved that night 
in Egypt, by the blood of the lamb. If somebody in Israel had thought, 
“I’ve lived a good life. So I don’t believe God will judge me,” and there-
fore didn’t put the blood of the lamb above his door, what do you think 
would  have  happened?  The  angel  of  death  would  have  come  in  and  
killed his eldest son as with all the other homes in Egypt.
I know that many people have taken advantage of the truth of salvation 
by grace through faith in the blood of Christ, and lived carelessly saying, 
“It doesn’t matter how we live.” But that does not negate the truth that 
salvation is still not by works but by grace through faith.
Ephesians  2:9  says,  “Not  as  a  result  of  works,  lest  any  man  should  
boast.” But then the very next verse says that after we are saved, God has 
created us “unto good works”. So the full truth is this:
We cannot be saved by any number of good works that we may do.
But if our “faith” does not produce good works after we are saved, that 
would prove that our faith was not genuine.
That’s what James says: “Faith without (good) works is dead” (James 
2:26).
After putting the blood on the door, the Israelites were all commanded 
to eat unleavened bread that night. That is a picture of our feeding on 
Christ  Himself,  the  Bread  of  Life.  It’s  not  enough  that  we  trust  in  His  
blood,  we  must  feed  on  His  life  too.  We  are  “reconciled  to  God  by  His  
death and saved by His life” (Romans 5:10).

Redemption from Egypt                                                                                                                             53
Exodus
They were also told to eat the bread in their travelling clothes – with 
a readiness to leave Egypt at a moment’s notice. That is how we are to 
live in this world too – always ready to go, as soon as Jesus calls us up 
to meet Him. This world is not our home. We must be ready to leave at 
any time.
I want you to see the righteousness of God in 12:35: “The sons of Israel 
requested  from  the  Egyptians  articles  of  silver  and  articles  of  gold  and  
clothing.” Why was that? Does God ask His children to demand money 
like that from unbelievers? It’s certainly not right for us to do so. But it 
was right for those Israelites, because the Egyptians had made 600,000 
Israelite  men  to  work  for  them  for  four  centuries  and  never  paid  them  
their  wages.  Now  God  was  ensuring  that  they  got  their  full  wages  for  
430 years, before they left Egypt!! God’s righteousness will catch up with 
everyone who has cheated others – even if it is 430 years later! No-one 
can escape the laws of a just God. In these little things, we see the right-
eousness of God in the Scriptures. 
When  the  Israelites  reached  the  Red  Sea,  they  discovered  that  they  
were  hemmed  in  on  every  side.  Behind  them  the  Egyptian  army  was  
pursuing  after  them,  on  either  side  they  saw  huge  mountains,  and  in  
front  of  them  was  the  Red  Sea.  There  was  only  one  direction  in  which  
they could look – UP. When we are in tight circumstances like that, deliv-
erance can come to us only from one place – heaven. 
The Psalmist said, “I lift up my eye to the hills. Is my help going to come 
from there? No. The Lord who made heaven and earth is going to help me” 
(Psalms 121:1, 2). 
The Lord told Moses, “Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which 
He will accomplish for you. The Lord will fight for you while you keep 
silent”  (14:13,  14).  The  Lord  split  open  the  Red  Sea  and  the  Israelites  
walked across on dry land. The sea-floor beneath them was not even wet 
– it was dry (Exodus 14:21, 22)!
1 Corinthians 10:2 says that their going through the sea is a picture 
of baptism  in  water. A pillar of cloud and fire also came down from 
heaven enveloping the Israelites and giving them light and protecting 
them from their enemies. That was a picture of the baptism in the Holy 
Spirit and fire.
Those Israelites had a 3-fold experience in their deliverance. They were 
redeemed by the blood of the Passover lamb, they were immersed in the 
Red  Sea,  and  they  were  immersed  in  the  cloud  that  came  down  from  
heaven. Those were their initial three experiences. And it was exactly like 
that for the early Christians – as described in the Acts of the Apostles. 
They  too  were  redeemed  by  the  blood  of  Christ,  baptised  in  water  and  
baptised in the Holy Spirit.

54 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
Why  did  the  pillar  of  cloud  and fire come  upon  those  Israelites  from  
heaven? It was not to give them a thrilling experience that they could 
testify  to.  No.  It  was  to  lead  them  to  the  Promised  Land,  where  they  
could conquer the giants and occupy their God-given land. 
Today  many  seek  for  the  baptism in the Holy Spirit and fire merely 
in  order  to  have  an  experience.  But  God’s  purpose  is  that  through  the  
Spirit’s power we might enter the Promised Land of victory and conquer 
the  giants  of  lust,  anger,  dirty  thoughts,  jealousy,  bitterness,  love  of  
money etc. that have ruled over us for many years. 
Canaan belonged to the Israelites, and not to those giants. God, Who 
owns the whole earth, had promised it to the seed of Abraham 430 years 
earlier. Our body too belongs to the Lord and not to the dirty lusts that 
have  ruled  over  it.  Many  believers  have  not  understood  that  the  main  
purpose of the baptism in the Holy Spirit is to recapture our body for the 
Lord – because Satan has blinded their eyes to this truth. Jesus told His 
apostles  that  through  the  power  that  they  receive  from  the  Spirit  they  
would be His witnesses – not just bear witness to Him with their mouths, 
but BE His witnesses by their lives (Acts 1:8). Our body is now to be a 
pure temple for the Holy Spirit where God can be glorified through the 
Spirit’s power (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20). Satan has not blinded the eyes of 
believers to the truth of redemption through the blood of Christ or to the 
truth of baptism in water. But he has blinded most of them from under-
standing the main purpose of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
The Egyptian army was then drowned in that Red Sea. Psalm 106:12 
says that when the Israelites saw the Egyptians dead, then they praised 
the Lord. The man who walks by sight can praise God only when he gets 
the  answer  to  his  prayer,  when  he  sees  his  enemies  actually  drowned. 
But the man who walks by faith says, “Lord, You have prepared a table 
before me in the presence of my enemies” (Psalms 23:5). The enemies 
are still there. But we sit with the Lord feasting at His table, because we 
know  the  Lord  will  deal  with  our  enemies.  Meanwhile,  He  anoints  our  
head with oil and our cups run over with praise (Psalms 23:5). To praise 
God after we see the answer to our prayers is easy and is an old-covenant 
life. The new covenant Christian praises God in faith, before he sees the 
answer.
Satan is still alive today, but he has been defeated. So we are not afraid 
of him. Neither are we afraid of his agents in the world (of any religion) 
who may try to harm us. They cannot touch a hair on our heads without 
God’s permission. God may allow them to kill us perhaps. That’s all right, 
because God allowed Satan’s agents to kill Jesus, James, Peter and Paul. 
All the apostles were killed except John – but only when God’s time for 
each of them had come – after each of them had finished their earthly 
ministry. We serve the same God and so we are not afraid.

Israel in the Wilderness                                                                                                                             55
Exodus
Israel in the Wilderness
We  read  of  Israel  in  the  wilderness  in  Chapter  15  onwards.  When  they  
came to the bitter waters of Marah (verse 23), they began to complain. 
This was again a test of their faith in God. God was asking them, “Can 
you  trust  Me  when  you  come  to  the  bitter  waters,  that  I  have  provided  
a  solution  for  that  too,  just  as  at  the  Red  Sea?  Or  will  you  distrust  Me  
again  and  grumble  and  complain?”  The  Israelites  had  just  praised  God  
for delivering them from the Egyptians. But here we see that they started 
grumbling again. The man who walks by sight grumbles and complains 
again and again. The man who walks by faith constantly praises God and 
thanks Him.
Exdous15 begins with the Israelites praising God and ends with their 
grumbling  against  Him.  This  pattern  was  repeated  again  and  again  by  
the  Israelites  in  the  wilderness.  The  “sine  wave”  (in  mathematics)  that  
goes  up  and  down  forever,  is  a  perfect  description  of  the  lives  of  most  
 believers – praising God when they get what they want, complaining when 
something goes wrong, thanking God again when they have got over that 
problem,  and  then  doubting  again  when  the  next  problem  arises.  This  
is because most believers live by sight and not by faith – exactly like the 
Israelites. On Sunday morning they praise God aloud in their meetings 
(at  times  in  other tongues).  But  from  Sunday  afternoon  onwards,  their  
speech is different, this time in their mother tongue. It is anger, grum-
bling and complaining – both in their homes and their offices!! Then the 
next Sunday the sine wave goes up and they start praising God again. 
After  that,  the  wave  goes  down  again!!  This  is  certainly  not  how  God  
intended His new-covenant children to live. Cannot the Holy Spirit who 
gives a person the gift of other tongues control his speech in his mother 
tongue  as  well?  He  certainly  can.  The  Bible  says,  “Rejoice  in  the  Lord  
always.  In  everything give  thanks”  (Philippians  4:4;  Ephesians  5:20). 
That is the will of God for us at all times, in the new covenant. But to do 
that we must live by faith. We must believe that God has already planned 
a solution for every problem that we ever face.
When  the  Israelites  complained  to  Moses,  he  cried  to  the  Lord,  and  
the Lord said, “The solution to the problem is right there – in front of you” 
(verse 25). The Lord showed him a tree. Moses cut down the tree and put 
it into the water, and the water was made sweet.
Who  planted  that  tree  in  the  wilderness?  Was  it  some  man  or  God?  
Undoubtedly  God!  Men  don’t  plant  trees  in  the  wilderness.  God  had  
planted  that  tree  near  Marah,  perhaps  100  years  earlier,  because  He  
knew that 100 years later His children would come to Marah and find 
its waters bitter. So He had actually planned a solution for their problem 
100  years  in  advance.  Do  you  realise  that  the  same  God  has  planned  
solutions  for  all  your  problems  also,  long  before  you  face  those  prob-
lems? To walk by faith is to believe that. No problem can suddenly crop 
up today that takes God by surprise. Not only does God already know in 

56 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
advance what problems the devil is preparing for us, He has also made a 
solution for all of them, in advance! So you can face every problem boldly. 
I can testify to the truth of this, after having faced numerous problems in 
my 56 years as a believer. I have never yet faced a problem for which God 
had not planned a solution! He planted seeds for trees, long before I came 
to the Marahs in my life – to make the waters sweet for me. Let me urge 
you also to walk by faith in our wonderful, loving Father who is always 
“silently planning for us in love” (Zephaniah 3:17 - paraphrase) – and you 
will overcome all your problems constantly. Never again will complaining 
and grumbling and anger be found in your mouth, but only praise and 
thanks to God.
In Chapter17, we see the Israelites coming to yet another place where 
there  was  no  water  to  drink.  The  sine  wave  goes  down  and  they  start  
grumbling again. Again the Lord shows them His solution that is right in 
front of their eyes. He tells Moses, “Look at that rock in front of you. Smite 
it” (verse 6). Moses smites the rock and the waters begin to flow. When I 
first read that passage, I used to picture a little rock and a little trickle 
of water coming out of it and everybody drinking. But do you know how 
many people were thirsty there in the wilderness? 600,000 men, between 
the ages of 20 and 60, alone. Then there were many older men, younger 
men and women and children? There must have been at least 2 million 
people  there.  How  much  water  do  you  think  2  million  people  need  to  
drink? Was it just a little trickle? No! It had to be many rivers flowing in 
many directions, if all those 2 million people had to drink fairly quickly. If 
those two million people had to stand in line to drink from a small trickle, 
many would have died of thirst, before they ever got to the front of the 
line! No. There were rivers there in the wilderness that flowed from the 
smitten rock. This is the picture that Jesus gave of the Spirit-filled life 
that flows from a crucified man (“a smitten rock”) in John 7:37–39.
When  Jesus  was  smitten  on  Calvary,  that  prepared  the  way  for  
Pentecost. Calvary always precedes Pentecost. When we are baptised 
in  the  Holy  Spirit,  rivers  of  living  water  don’t start flowing from us 
immediately. If we are honest, we will admit that. God has to do a work 
of smiting and crucifixion in us thereafter to break us, before the rivers 
can begin to flow from us to bless others. God looks for ordinary, good-
for-nothing, weak, stupid people like you and me whom He can make 
a  blessing  to  millions  on  the  face  of  the  earth.  But  it  all  depends  on  
whether we will allow God to smite us and break us or not.
Immediately after the rivers began to flow, we read in verse 8, “Then 
Amalek  came.”  Amalek  is  a  picture  of  our  flesh,  throughout  the  Old 
Testament. The Spirit and the flesh are in constant conflict. As soon as 
the rivers began to flow Amalek appeared to fight against God’s people. 
As  soon  as  Jesus  was  anointed  with  the  Holy  Spirit,  Satan  came  to  

God’s Laws                                                                                                                                                    57
Exodus
tempt Him (Luke 3:22; 4:1, 2). Amalek was finally defeated by Moses and 
Joshua  working  together.  Moses  lifted  up  his  hands  in  prayer  on  the  
hilltop and Joshua fought the Amalekites in the valley. It is this combi-
nation that will enable us to overcome the flesh too – the sword of the 
Spirit (God’s Word) used directly against the enemy (as Jesus used it in 
the wilderness) and our hands lifted up in prayer to God (recognising our 
weakness and helplessness).
When  Moses’  hands  were  tired,  Aaron  and  Hur  held  up  his  hands  
(17:12). We also need Aarons and Hurs to help us out when we are weak 
and tired. One of the great truths that I have discovered in my Christian 
life is this: I can’t make it alone. I need my fellow-believers in the body of 
Christ. If I am standing here today without having fallen by the wayside 
many years ago, and without having compromised on my convictions, one 
of the reasons is that I have brothers and sisters who have encouraged 
me, prayed for me and exhorted me, constantly. I have many Aarons and 
Hurs who have held up my hands through the years and I have learnt 
to  value  them  immensely.  Aaron  and  Hur  were  not  as  gifted  as  Moses  
and they did not know God in the way Moses knew God. But Moses still 
needed them. Aaron was at least a leader. But Hur was an unknown man 
who never appears again in the Scriptures! But Moses, the great man of 
God, needed the help of even this unknown man. Don’t ever despise the 
weak unknown brothers in the body of Christ. You need them, even if you 
are the greatest man of God in the world. Even Jesus asked stumbling 
Peter, James and John to hold up His hands in Gethsemane! “Even the 
Head (Christ) does not say to the feet (the lowest members in the Body), 
I don’t need you’” (1 Corinthians 12:21).
God’s Laws
In Chapters  19  to  24,  we  read  of  many  of  the  laws  that  God  gave  the  
Israelites. The ten commandments are listed in 20:1–17. There is only one 
commandment among them that has a promise attached to it (and this is 
also mentioned in Ephesians 6:1, 3), “Honour your father and mother that 
it may go well with you and that you may live long on the earth.”. This is 
the one commandment that we must teach all our children in our homes.
After giving the Israelites the ten commandments, Moses says to them, 
“Don’t  be  afraid.  These  commandments  are  only  to  test  you”  (verse  20). 
The  people  had  already  told  Moses  earlier  that  they  would  obey  God  
in  everything  He  commanded  (19:8).  So  the  Lord  gave  them  these  
10 commandments. The Israelites then spent the next 1500 years diso-
beying every one of those commandments – thus proving that man can 
never keep God’s laws, even if he wants to. That’s why a new covenant 
was needed. The first covenant (the Law) was faulty (Hebrews 8:7–13).
Immediately after giving them the ten commandments, God gave the 
Israelites  a  beautiful  parable  in  Chapter  21  to  teach  them  the  spirit  

58 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
in  which  they  were  to  keep  His  commandments.  There  he  speaks  of  a  
Hebrew slave who is set free by his master because he has finished his 
six years of compulsory slavery. God’s law had stated that in the seventh 
year all Hebrew slaves must be released. But if in the seventh year this 
slave comes to his master and says, “I love you, my master. I don’t want 
to go out free. I want to continue serving you – no longer as a slave in 
bondage, but now freely out of love” (verse 5). And he continues serving 
his master forever thereafter.
It  is  interesting  to  note  that  this  comes  immediately  after  the  giving  
of  the  ten  commandments.  It  was  to  teach  the  Israelites  that  what  
God  really  wanted  from  them  was  not  slavish,  external  obedience  to  
the letter of the law, but joyful, loving obedience from the heart to the 
spirit of the law. Jesus said, “If you love Me, keep My commandments” 
– implying that if we did not love Him, He didn’t want our obedience 
under the new covenant. The old covenant spirit was summed up in 
the  ten  commandments:  “Thou  shalt,  thou  shalt  not,  thou  shalt,  thou  
shalt not...”. The Israelites had no choice. But Jesus came saying, “IF 
any man wants to follow Me, let him...”.
In 15:26,  God  said  to  the  Israelites,  “If  you  will  give  earnest  heed  to  
the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in His sight, and give 
ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the 
diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians, for I, the Lord, am your 
Healer.”  This  was  not,  as  some  understand  it,  a  promise  of  healing.  It  
was a promise of something even better than healing – health. Don’t you 
think health is better than healing? To get healing you have to be sick 
first! But the Lord told them that if they obeyed all His laws, they would 
not even get sick. They would be healthy! This was one reason why He 
gave them many laws on hygiene. If you are a glutton and you fall sick, 
you have to blame yourself. There is essentially no difference between a 
drunkard who dies prematurely because of his addiction to alcohol and 
a glutton who dies prematurely due to his addiction to good food! God’s 
laws  can  preserve  us  in  health.  You  won’t  need  to  go  and  ask  God  for  
healing so much, if you begin by obeying His laws. He will keep you in 
health. You will grow old and be a healthy, old man, not a sick, old man 
full of sickness caused by tensions and overeating.
In 23:9, we read another law: “Don’t oppress a stranger since you your-
selves know the feelings of a stranger, for you also were strangers in the 
land of Egypt.” We must be kind and merciful to people, because God has 
been so kind and merciful to us.
In 31:16, 17, we read about the law on the Sabbath. There are many 
arguments  in  the  scientific  community  as  to  whether  the  six  days  in 
which  the  earth  was  remade  were  six  24-hour  days  or  symbolic  days  
representing millions of years. The answer is very clear here. The Lord 

God’s Laws                                                                                                                                                    59
Exodus
made the earth in six days and He instituted the seventh day of the week 
as a day of rest. 
That sabbath however has been fulfilled in Christ (Colossians 2:16, 17). 
So  we  don’t  keep  the  physical  sabbath  any  more  now,  because,  as  the  
Lord said very clearly here, it was a sign between Him and the Israelites 
alone.
In Chapters 32 and 33, we read of the Israelites worshipping a golden 
calf, and committing adultery in a feast to their idol. Moses had gone to 
the top of Mount Sinai and was away from the camp for just forty days. 
That was enough time for the people to go astray. Aaron was powerless 
to  control  them.  Israel  was  preserved  in  the  ways  of  God  by  just  one  
man – Moses. As long as He was present in the midst, they feared him 
and  obeyed  God’s  laws.  The  moment  he  went  away,  they  fell  into  sin.  
It  was  just  one  man  who  preserved  those  two  million  people  in  God’s  
ways  for  40  years.  This  is  how  it  has  been  throughout  the  centuries  
in church history too. During the three years that Paul was present in 
Ephesus, the wolves could not enter the church. The moment Paul left, 
the wolves entered in (Acts 20:29–31). It was so here in the wilderness 
too. The moment Moses went away, decay set in. God is looking for men 
like Moses today who can arrest the decay among His people. God can do 
more through one man like Moses than through a thousand compromis-
ers like Aaron. When Moses came back to the camp, he once again set 
matters straight and led the people back to God. 
It  is  here  that  we  read  of  Moses  asking  who  would  be  on  the  Lord’s  
side  to  stand  with  him  against  all  the  sin  in  the  camp  (Exodus  32:26). 
The tribe of Levi alone came out and stood with Moses that day. Moses 
commanded them to go into the camp and kill all the leaders of the idola-
try and not to spare their own relatives in the process. And they went into 
the camp and did that. That was the reason why the Lord gave the tribe 
of Levi the privilege of being His priests. That was not an arbitrary choice. 
He chose them because they chose to stand for Him (See Deuteronomy 
33:8–11 and Malachi 2:4, 5). Aaron’s grandson Phinehas also acted in the 
same spirit some years later and God made a covenant of priesthood with 
him too (Numbers 25:7–12). Even today, God appoints as His representa-
tives, those who will deal ruthlessly with sin in the church.
It is here too that we see how much Moses had imbibed of the spirit of 
Christ, through His long talks with the Lord on the mountain. He goes 
before the Lord in intercession and says that he is willing to be sent to hell 
eternally, if only God would forgive the sin of the Israelites (Exodus 32:31, 
32). This is the spirit of Calvary’s cross. 
It is here also that we read of God Himself telling Moses that a person’s 
name  can  be  blotted  out  of  the  book  of  life,  even  if  it  was  once  in  it  
(Exodus 32:33). There are different opinions among Christians on this 
doctrine. But all arguments that anyone may have are silenced when 

60 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
we see this warning repeated in the New Testament by the Lord Jesus 
Himself in Revelation 3:5 – a warning that we will all do well to take 
heed to.
In 32:34 and 33:14–16, we read of Moses’ passion for the person of the 
Lord. This has always been the hallmark of all godly men. They have a 
passion for the Lord Himself more than for His work. Moses tells the Lord 
that he and the Israelites will not move from that place if a mere angel 
from  heaven  were  sent  with  them.  The  Lord  Himself must  accompany  
them. God Who is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him granted 
Moses that request. 
Moses’ passion for the Lord is seen further in 33:18 where He prays 
that he might see the glory of God. God told him that it was impossible 
for any man to see His face and live. But He would hide Moses in a cleft of 
a rock (a type of our crucified Lord) and then Moses would be able to see 
a bit of His glory. That glory, God also said consisted of “His goodness” 
(33:19). Yes, it  is  the  goodness  of  God  that  is  His  glory. And  when  that  
glory comes into our lives, it will make us do good to both good and evil 
people, just as Jesus did (Acts 10:38).
The Tabernacle
A large part of Exodus (Chapters 25 to 31 and 35 to 40) deals with the 
construction of the tabernacle of God. In our study of Genesis, we saw 
the origin of the two streams of false and true religion in Cain and Abel 
that finally ends in Revelation as Babylon and Jerusalem. The tabernacle 
is the seed from which the temple of God came later. It is a picture of the 
ultimate Jerusalem, the church, the dwelling place of God. 
The literal translation of John 1:14 reads thus: “The Word became flesh 
and tabernacled among us.”
So this Old Testament tabernacle was first of all, a picture of Jesus 
himself, and then of His body the church, the dwelling place of God. And 
also of each of us who are children of God, in whom the Holy Spirit dwells. 
God  was  very  particular  that  every  part  of  the  tabernacle  should  be  
made  exactly  according  to  the  pattern  that  He  gave  Moses  (Exodus 
25:9). God gave Moses specific instructions about the sizes of the differ-
ent parts of the tabernacle and the materials to be used for each. Many 
Christians do not realise the need to do everything in the church and 
in  their  lives  also,  exactly  as  the  Lord  has  commanded  in  His  Word.  
They allow their human understanding often to decide how far to obey 
God and where to modify His commands. 
Moses had seen the construction of magnificent pyramids in Egypt. 
But he did not modify God’s simple pattern of the tabernacle to make it 

The Tabernacle in the Wilderness

62 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
more appealing to human eyes. In every detail, he constructed it exactly 
as  the  Lord  had  commanded  him  (Exodus  39:1–40:33).  That  was  why  
the glory of God filled it. If Moses had been given this pattern when he 
was 40 years old, he may have tried to ‘improve’ on God’s pattern with 
his Egyptian wisdom! The tabernacle would certainly have looked more 
impressive then – but the glory of God would have been absent. This is 
what has happened in many churches that have modified the standards 
of God’s Word to please their congregations.
God’s  thoughts  and  ways  are  far  higher  than  ours  (Isaiah  55:8,  9). 
Those who do not realise this will always add their human ideas to God’s 
commandments.  Only  those  who  are  eager  for  the  glory  of  God  to  be  
manifested  in  their  church  will  seek  God’s  perfect  pattern  and  will  for  
their lives. Our Lord lived His entire life on earth fulfilling minute details 
of Old Testament prophecies that had been made concerning His birth, 
life and death. He was careful at all times to fulfil everything that was 
written “in the Book” concerning Him (Hebrews 10:7). That was why the 
glory of God was manifest in Him always.
When God gave instructions for the construction of the tabernacle in 
25:8, He told Moses, “Let them construct a sanctuary for Me, that I may 
dwell  among  them”.  This  is  our  primary  calling  –  to  be  a  holy  dwelling  
place for God. All other things – even good things – must be treated as 
secondary. If we lose sight of this calling, it will be easy to be occupied with 
secondary matters like evangelism, Bible-teaching, charity programmes 
etc. all of which are good in themselves. But if the church does not become 
a holy dwelling place of God, we have failed in our primary purpose. Does 
God feel at home in your heart? In your home? In your church? Those are 
the most important questions. Not “How much are you doing for God?” or 
“How much are you helping other people?”
It was when Moses was alone with God on the mountain, fasting and 
praying for forty days that he saw the pattern for the tabernacle (Exodus 
25:40). If we are in too much of a hurry to wait on God today, we cannot 
expect to understand God’s perfect will and pattern for His church. 
God called Bezalel and Oholiab to build the tabernacle and we see that 
He gave them all the supernatural abilities that they needed to do this 
task – through the Holy Spirit (Exodus 31:1–3). This teaches us that if God 
calls us to build His church today, He will give us also the supernatural 
gifts of the Holy Spirit that we need to complete that work.
The Parts of the Tabernacle
Notice the order in which God gave the instructions for the construction 
of the tabernacle. 
While  human  wisdom  would  have  started  with  outlining  the  dimen-
sions of the tabernacle first, before going into the smaller details, God 
began first of all by giving Moses the details of the ark of the covenant. 

The Parts of the Tabernacle                                                                                                                      63
Exodus
The ark was a small piece of furniture to be placed in the smallest room 
of  the  tabernacle  –  the  most  holy  place  (Exodus  25:10).  But  that  room  
was where the glory of God was going to be present. And so that came 
first. In other words God started with Himself. It’s just like we saw in 
Genesis: “In the beginning God.”
God’s ways are not man’s ways. In every church this is where we must 
begin: With God. Not with activity but with God in the Most Holy Place. 
We must begin with the things that are “most holy” in the Christian life.
Adam spent his very first day in fellowship with God and only then did 
he go to work in the garden. So must it be with us too – God first and then 
His work – whether evangelism, or teaching or social work or whatever. 
God first and then  doctrinal  matters.  It  is  because  we  don’t  follow  this  
order that there is so much strife and disunity among us. 
When the Lord taught His disciples to pray, He did not teach them to 
begin  by  asking  the  Father  to  forgive  their  sins,  even  though  that  was  
so vital for fellowship with the Father. He taught them to first pray that 
God’s Name would be hallowed, that His kingdom would come and that 
His will would be done. This is what is implied in God starting with the 
ark. God will always back anyone who gives Him first place in his life, his 
home and his church.
The tabernacle is a picture of man. The tabernacle had three parts –
most holy place, holy place and outer court. This corresponds exactly to 
the three parts of man’s being – spirit, soul and body (1 Thessalonians 
5:23).
In the tabernacle, God dwelt in the most holy place showing that He 
seeks  to  dwell  in  our  spirit –  the  deepest  part  of  our  being.  He  does  

64 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
not dwell in our soul (mind and emotions). Understanding this clearly 
can save us from a lot of deception. For example, we will realise that 
an emotional meeting  may  not  necessarily  be  a  spiritual meeting,  for  
God  may  not have  been  there  at  all,  because  God  does  not  dwell  in  
our emotions. Likewise a meeting where we studied God’s Word intel-
lectually  may  not  have  been  a  spiritual meeting  either,  because  God  
does not dwell in our minds. The soul is as different from the spirit as 
the ear is from the eye. Just as a man can have good hearing and bad 
eyesight,  a  man  can  have  a  brilliant  intellect  and  yet  be  dead  in  his  
spirit. Likewise, a man can be very emotional in praising God and still 
be totally impure in his heart. The soul and spirit are totally different 
and God does not dwell in our soul. Knowing this truth can also save 
us from a lot of psychological, emotional, and logical deception being 
practised by many preachers in their preaching today.
The  tabernacle  had  an  outer  court  that  was  150  feet  long  by  75  feet  
wide. It was very small compared to the rest of the camp, just like the 
church is a very small fellowship of people, when compared to the rest of 
the world. 
At the far end of the outer court was a tent – 45 feet long and 15 feet 
wide. This was divided into two parts – the holy place (30 feet by 15 feet) 
and the most holy place (a 15-foot square). The height of the tent was 15 
feet. This made the most holy place into a cube, having the same length, 
breadth and height. 
In Revelation 21:16, we read that the heavenly Jerusalem (the bride of 
Christ) is also a cube – 1500 miles long, wide and high. This symbolises 
that those whose depth (inner life) is not equal to their external life – the 
front  that  they  project  to  others  –  cannot  live  in  God’s  presence.  God  
rejects hypocrites who give an appearance of spirituality to others, but 
who have no corresponding inner life (depth).
The tabernacle was surrounded by the camp of Israel on all four sides. 
There was a specific place for each tribe. The three sons of Levi – Merari, 
Gershon and Kohath – looked after the tabernacle and their tents were 
closest  to  the  tabernacle.  When  the  tribe  of  Levi  was  taken  out  of  the  
reckoning of Israel’s tribes, the tribe of Joseph was split into two tribes – 
Manasseh and Ephraim. So there were still 12 tribes. 
The outer  court  of  the  tabernacle  is  described  in  27:9–19.  A  sheet  of  
fine white linen – symbolising the righteousness of Christ – enclosed it. 
This  teaches  us  that  the  thing  that  separates  those  inside  the  church  
from those outside, is not a higher level of human righteousness, but the 
fact that those inside are clothed with the righteousness of Christ. The 
white  linen  also  symbolises  the  simplicity  that  should  characterise  the  
church. Babylon the harlot, on the other hand, is depicted in Revelation 
as  grandly  decked  –  in  contrast  to  the  simplicity  found  in  the  bride  of  
Christ (compare Revelation 17:4 with 19:8).

Exodus
The Camp of The Israelites

66 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
There was only one entrance to the tabernacle – a 30-foot wide curtain 
on  the  eastern  side,  by  which  alone  anyone  could  enter.  This  symbol-
ised Christ being the one and only way to the Father. One entered the 
tabernacle with his back to the sun (in the east), indicating thereby his 
rejection of the worship of the sun (that was common in Egypt and all 
over  the  world  at  that  time).  Unfortunately,  there  are  Christians  who  
still  face  east  today,  when  they  pray  –  and  especially  at  their  “sunrise 
services” on “Easter” morning! The devil has cleverly brought them full 
circle back, to worship the sun-god of the Egyptians!
In the outer court, there were two items – the altar of sacrifice and the 
laver.
The tent had a curtain at the entrance to the holy place. Between the 
holy  place  and  the  most  holy  place,  was  another  thick  curtain  (“veil”  –  
Hebrews 10:20). This was the veil (duplicated in the temple in Jerusalem) 
that was rent in two, when Jesus died on the cross, indicating that the 
way to fellowship with the Father was now open to all.
All  Israelites  were  permitted  to  enter  the  outer  court.  But  only  the  
priests could enter into the holy place. The holy place contained the altar 
of incense, the lampstand and the table of bread. 
Into the most holy place, only the high priest could enter – and that too, 
only once a year, on the day of atonement, with the blood of the sacrifice. 
There the ark of the covenant was kept, covered by the mercy seat. The 
glory of God was visibly present here. 
The Tent and its Boards
The  tent  of  the  tabernacle  is  described  in  26:1–27.  It  was  constructed  
with boards made of cheap acacia wood overlaid with gold. This symbol-
ised Jesus being both God (gold) and Man (wood). It also symbolises the 
members of the Body of Christ today who although human, have been 
made partakers of the Divine nature (2 Peter 1:4).
Each board had two legs that sat in two silver bases for stability when 
resting  on  the  desert  sands.  The  silver  sockets  speak  of  the  redemptive  
work of Christ on which we stand securely in the wilderness of this world. 

The Parts of the Tabernacle                                                                                                                      67
Exodus
Silver  is  a  picture  of  redemption  throughout  the  Old  Testament  
(See Exodus 38:25, 27 and 30:16). Judas Iscariot also sold our Lord 
for 30 pieces of silver. The two legs symbolise faith and obedience – 
that should be found in each believer, for stability in the desert of 
this world. Those who major on faith without obedience will be as 
unbalanced as a board with just one leg. Those who stress legalis-
tic obedience without faith will also be equally unbalanced.
The  wooden  boards  were  placed  next  to  each  other  without  
any  gap  between  them  –  symbolising  the  close  fellowship  that  
should exist between the members of Christ’s body. Each board 
had four loops  through  which  bars  were  placed,  to  hold  the  
boards  together.  A  fifth bar  was  passed  internally  (from  end  to  
end) through the middle of all the boards. These five bars held 
the  boards  close  together  and  made  them  stable.  This  symbolises  that  
besides  faith  and  obedience,  we  also  need  close  fellowship  with  each  
other in the Body of Christ if we are to be stable Christians.
The Coverings of the Tent
The  tent  of  the  tabernacle  had  four coverings.  The  innermost  covering  
was  of  fine linen with  intricate  designs  woven  into  it,  symbolising  the  
beauty of the righteousness of Christ. The second covering was made of 
goats’ skins symbolising Christ as the scapegoat who took our sins far 
away. The third covering was made of rams’ skins dyed red symbolising 
Jesus as our Substitute Who shed His blood for us. The outermost cover-
ing was made of badger’s skins – which had a dirty brown appearance 
and was always covered with the desert sand. 
So  the  most  beautiful  covering  was  visible  only  inside the  tent.  The  
true  beauty  of  a  Christian  must  be  inward,  not  outward. Psalm  45:13  
says  that  “the  king’s  daughter  is  all  glorious  on  the  inside.”  In  other  
words, there should be more sacrifice in a Christian’s inner life than 
other  people  can  see  on  the  outside.  In  the  world  however,  things  are  
quite the opposite – people are beautiful on the outside but filthy in their 
hearts.  A  tabernacle  in  which  all  the  glory  is  on  the  outside  is  not  the  
tabernacle of God but a Babylonian tabernacle.
The badgers’ skins on the outside symbolise “the reproach of Christ”. 
Outwardly, the church will always be misunderstood and dishonoured. 
Jesus was despised and rejected by the world. Only those who wanted 
godliness  came  to  Him.  It  must  be  the  same  with  the  church.  People  
should be drawn to our churches, not by our worldly attractiveness or 
music, but rather by the godliness of our life and our fellowship. Those 
who belong to Jesus will go to Him “outside the camp of this world” and 
“inside the veil” to fellowship with God (See Hebrews 13:13 and 10:19, 20). 
The vast majority of Christians however, live inside the camp of the world 
and outside the  veil!  To  go  outside  the  camp  means  to  be  rejected  by  

68 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
the world. If Jesus was misunderstood and called the prince of devils by 
people in His day, how much more we the members of His family will be 
called by worse names (Matthew 10:25). The reason why many Christians 
are popular with the world (unlike Jesus) is because they have sought to 
please men and are diplomatic and compromising.
As a young Christian, I was often drawn to certain preachers, because 
their preaching was wonderful. But when I got close to them I found that 
they  were  proud  and  haughty.  Many  of  them  lost  their  temper  easily.  
Their children were ungodly and they lorded over their co-workers. There 
was no glory inside. The glory was all on the outside. That I have seen 
now is one of the clearest marks of a Babylonian preacher. The true tent 
of God is the very opposite of this. The glory inside is greater than what 
you see on the outside.
The Bronze Altar of Sacrifice
The first item in the outer court of the tabernacle was the altar of sacri-
fice, which was a hollow bronze enclosure placed on the ground. The 
sacrifices had to be placed on the ground inside the altar, for God had 
said that His altar was always to be one of earth (created by God and not 
constructed by any man – symbolising Calvary’s cross, an altar made by 
God Himself – Exodus 20:24, 25).
The altar was not to have any steps going up to it, but only a sloping 
ramp (Exodus 20:26). This symbolised the fact that there are no “steps to 
salvation” and that there are no mediators or steps to go to the crucified 
Christ. You go directly to Him. 
The  altar  was  made  of  wood covered  with  bronze.  Bronze  stands  for  
judgement. When the bronze became hot with the altar-fires, the char-
ring of the wood inside could not be seen on the outside. This symbolised 

The Parts of the Tabernacle                                                                                                                      69
Exodus
the  inner  sufferings  of  Christ  that  no  one  could  see  (1  Peter  4:1).  Most  
Christians have seen only the external sufferings of Jesus on the cross. 
They  have  no  idea  about  the  inner sufferings  that  our  Lord  endured  
during His earthly life, as He faced different situations and temptations 
each day (Hebrews 4:15). 
When we draw near to God, we learn more about the inner sufferings 
that Christ went through. For example, when He was a young boy, people 
considered Him to be an illegitimate child and must have pointed at Him 
and  said,  “His  mother  is  Mary.  But  we  don’t  know  who  his  father  is.”  
There were many other inner sufferings that He must have gone through 
during His life. The greatest of all was the break of fellowship with His 
Father on the cross. That suffering was far greater than the nails and the 
crown of thorns. Most of us don’t know the agony of “a break of fellow-
ship” with the Father, because we are so used to our fellowship with the 
Father being broken.
Consider  this  example:  People  who  live  in  a  slum  do  not  know  what  
perfect  hygienic  conditions  are.  But  those  who  have  lived  in  houses  
where they have never even seen a lizard or a cockroach in their entire 
lives, will shrink back when they see such things in our houses! It was 
like that for Jesus. From all eternity He had lived in perfect fellowship 
with His Father. And then in Gethsemane, He thought of the prospect of 
being made sin and losing that fellowship when He hung on the cross. He 
was not afraid of the physical suffering. He would have been willing to go 
through a hundred physical crucifixions. But when He asked His Father 
“Do I have to drink this cup?” – that cup was not the physical suffering. 
It was the fellowship with His Father that would be broken on the cross. 
That was what He wanted to avoid at any cost. He prayed and prayed, 
and the Father told Him, “There is no other way.” So our Lord said, “All 
right, Father, I’ll accept it for the sake of fallen man.” There we see the 
love of Jesus for us – at Gethsemane. 
This altar had four horns in the corners to which the sacrificial animals 
were tied, before they were slain. Psalms 118:27 says, “Bind the festival 
sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar.” That speaks of the stead-
fastness, of Jesus in being determined to go to the cross. It says in Luke 
9:51,  “He  steadfastly  set  His  face  to  go  to  Jerusalem.” Nothing  would  
deter Him. We who want to follow Jesus must steadfastly set our face to 
go that way too. 
The Bronze Laver
The laver was a large tub for holding water, that was kept in front of the 
tent. It was made from the polished brass mirrors that the women of Israel 
used (Exodus 38:8). This symbolised the Word of God first of all. James 
1:23–25 says that God’s word is like a mirror. When the priests came to 
the  laver  they  could  see  whether  their  faces  were  dirty  and  they  could  

70 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
wash and be clean to serve the Lord 
in the holy place. Christ also “washes 
us with the word of God” (as we hear 
and obey it), so that we can serve Him 
in holiness (Ephesians 5:26).
The  laver  also  symbolises  water  
baptism. 
God cleanses us by water first and 
then by the fire of the Holy Spirit – even 
as gold is cleansed both by water and 
by fire (Numbers 31:21–23). Washing 
by the word from external sins in the 
outer court gives us a good testimony 
before people. But if we do not press on into the most holy place and allow 
the fire of God to cleanse us inwardly, we will never become spiritual. We 
will remain forever as religious people.
The Golden Table of Bread
Inside the tent, in the holy place, there were three items of furniture. On 
the northern side was the table of bread, on the southern side the lamp-
stand, and on the western end the altar of incense. 
The golden table had 12 loaves of bread on it, representing the twelve 
tribes  of  Israel.  This  represents  Jesus  as  the  Bread  of  life  by  which  
we are to live (Matthew 4:4). There were twelve separate loaves in the 
old covenant, because Israel could not become one body. Each tribe 
retained  its  own  distinctiveness.  But  in  the  new  covenant,  we  have  
only  one  loaf  of  bread  representing  Christ’s  body  at  the  Lord’s  table,  
because we are all one body, even though we are from many different 
tribes and backgrounds.
Only the priests were allowed to eat this bread under the old covenant, 
and they ate it on behalf of Israel’s tribes. But today, we can all partake 

The Parts of the Tabernacle                                                                                                                      71
Exodus
of the bread ourselves, because each of us can have a direct contact with 
Christ our Head, without going through any leader or mediator.
The Golden Lampstand
The lampstand symbolises the testimony of our life as well as of the local 
church. It is a picture of Christ as the light of the world and also of us as 
the light of the world (Matthew 5:14). The priests were to ensure that this 
lamp was always kept burning with oil, symbolising our responsibility to 
ensure that our testimony is burning brightly at all times, by the power 
of the Holy Spirit. 
In the old covenant, the lampstand was only one, with seven branches. 
This symbolised Israel as one denomination with many branches. But in 
the  new  covenant,  we  see  (in  the  book  of  Revelation)  that  each  church  
is represented by a separate lampstand, and that the Lord walks in the 
midst  of  them,  as  the  Head  of  each  
separate     lampstand     (Revelation 
1:20). This teaches us that new-cov-
enant churches are meant by God to 
be independent units directly under 
the  headship  of  Christ,  unlike  the  
tribes  of  Israel.  But  most  churches  
today  still  follow  the  Old  Testament  
pattern of being branches of a large 
denomination  (one  large  lampstand  
with many branches). 
Each of the seven lamps in the lampstand (symbolising each member 
of a local church) was to burn brightly on its own. Any member of a 
church who sins (whose light has died out), should set matters right 
and  trim  his  lamp  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  Otherwise,  he  should  
withdraw  from  his  local  church  so  that  the  Lord’s  testimony  in  that  
church  is  not  dishonoured  in  any  way,  because  of  him.  It  is  only  as  
we follow God’s pattern exactly that His glory can fill our local church.
The Golden Altar of Incense
The altar of incense represents prayer in Jesus’ Name (Revelation 5:8). 
Prayer is an expression of our dependence on God. Prayer in Jesus’ Name 
(like this incense) must rise from our hearts to God at all times (Exodus 
30:8; Luke  18:1). Moses was commanded specifically that this incense 
was to be prepared in a certain proportion only for the Lord and never to 
be made for any man (Exodus 30:37). This symbolises two things. 
First of all, it symbolises that we cannot pray to God in our own merit. 
The Name of Jesus is not a magic word (or mantra) that we use to come 

72 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
before God. It implies that we come in the merit of the Lord Jesus alone. 
If  we  pray  as  those  who  deserve to  get  answers  from  God  because  of  
some imagined merit in us, then such prayers are not being offered in 
Jesus’ Name. Prayer in the Name of Jesus implies that the only standing 
that we have before God is what we have in Christ. Those who consider 
themselves better than others will find that God answers the prayers of 
those others and not their own, because those others go to God without 
any merit of their own.
Secondly, this symbolises that we must never pray for anything for our 
own benefit. Whatever we do, we are commanded to do for the glory of 
God alone (1 Corinthians 10:31). Every prayer that we pray for ourselves 
should  also  be  for  the  glory  of  God.  This  is  the  reason  why  the  prayer  
of a righteous man is powerful – because he seeks God’s glory alone in 
everything (James 5:16).
The Veil – The Way into the Most Holy Place
The  tabernacle  (the  outer  court,  the  holy  place  and  the  most  holy  place) 
was a picture of man – body, soul and spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:23).
The word of God is like a sword that divides between our soul and spirit 
(Hebrews  4:12).  When  we  read  God’s  Word,  it  enters  our  soul (mind 
and emotions) first. It instructs our mind and stirs our emotions. But if 
it stops there and does not make us yield our will in obedience to God, 
then the Word cannot enter through the veil into our spirit – and we 
will not grow spiritually. The veil is our human will which must submit 
to God’s will.
Jesus came down from heaven not to do His own will but the will of His 
Father Who sent Him (John 6:38). All through His earthly life His attitude 
to His Father was, “Not My will but Yours be done”. This is where we are 
called  to  follow  Jesus  too.  Many  do  not  become  spiritual  because  even  
though they understand God’s will and are stirred by it in their emotions, 
they do not give up their own will to do God’s will. Denying one’s own will 

The Parts of the Tabernacle                                                                                                                      73
Exodus
and doing the Father’s will is the secret of true spirituality. Jesus has now 
inaugurated this new and living way for us – so that we can walk on it 
every day (Hebrews 10:19, 20). This is not a door through which we enter 
once for all. It is a way along which we have to walk every day. Only thus 
can we live in the most holy place at all times.
The Golden Ark of the Covenant
The most holy place contained the golden ark with the mercy seat as a lid 
on it. The ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat were together a picture 
of Christ as the Mediator of the new covenant between God and Man. The 
mercy seat was where the blood was sprinkled on the day of atonement. 
It had two golden cherubs on it. Cherubs were the ones who guarded the 
tree of life in Eden with a flaming sword (Genesis 3:24). That sword first 
fell on Jesus, when He died on the cross. But that sword fell on us too, 
for we too were crucified with Him (Galatians 2:20). The only way for us 
to  come  to  the  tree  of  life  (Christ)  now,  is  by  accepting  this  sword  and  
allowing our self-will to be slain. 
Inside  the  ark  were  kept  the  two  tablets  of  
stone  (with  the  ten  commandments  written  on  
them), a golden pot of manna, and Aaron’s rod. 
Let  us  look  at  the  manna first. Even though 
the manna came from heaven, if it was kept over-
night, it would breed worms and stink. But when the same manna was 
kept in the presence of God, it did not stink for forty years in the wilder-
ness. The symbolism here is this: If God’s truth is held only in our minds, 
it will stink after a while. But if we hold it in humility in God’s presence, 
it  will  remain  fresh  perpetually.  There  is  an  anointing  and  a  freshness  
when a man who lives in God’s presence preaches God’s Word. But the 
same message, when spoken by another, can be as dry as dead bones. 
Likewise, you can have an anointing from heaven and preach powerfully 
one day. If you lose that anointing the next day, and you preach the very 
same  sermon,  it  will  be  dry  and  dead.  The  reason  why  a  lot  of  today’s  

74 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
preaching is boring is because preachers are not living in the presence of 
God. Their sermons, like the old manna, are breeding worms and stink-
ing. It takes only 24 hours for hardening of heart to begin in any of us, 
according to Hebrews 3:13. 
“Exhort (encourage) one another daily (24 hours), lest any one of you be 
hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.”
Now let’s look at Aaron’s rod: There was a time when people questioned 
the  authority  of  Moses  and  Aaron  (Numbers  16).  God  then  asked  each  
tribe  to  bring  a  dead  tree-branch.  These  rods  were  kept  overnight  in  
God’s presence. Aaron’s rod alone budded during the night and brought 
forth  fruit  (Numbers  17). This  rod  was  thereafter  kept  in  the  ark  as  a  
reminder to the people that God bears witness to His servants by bring-
ing forth resurrection-life out of death. This rod also remained fresh for 
40 years (like the manna), teaching us that authority also remains valid 
only as long as it is exercised in the presence of God.
In the days of Samuel, some curious Israelites once lifted this mercy 
seat to see what was inside the ark and were slain by the Lord immedi-
ately (1 Samuel 6:19). This shows us how dangerous it is to try to inquire 
into hidden matters that do not concern us and that God has chosen not 
to reveal to us (See Deuteronomy 29:29).
The High Priest’s Dress
Aaron the high priest symbolises Jesus our High 
Priest.  His  outward  dress  consisted  of  three  
items.  First  of  all,  a  tunic  made  of  fine  white 
linen  symbolising  the  righteousness  of  Christ.  
Over that he had to wear a blue robe, with bells 
and figures of pomegranates alternately hanging 
all  round  the  bottom  of  the  robe.  Blue  is  the  
colour  of  the  sky  and  speaks  of  heavenliness.  
The  pomegranates  symbolised  the  fruit  of  the  
Spirit, and the bells the gifts of the Spirit. Jesus 
had both the fruit and the gifts of the Spirit in 
His life – and we need both too, if we are to serve 
God  effectively.  On  top  of  this  robe,  he  had  to  
wear a multi-coloured apron called an ephod.
The  ephod  had  three  items  that  came  along  
with it: Two shoulder-plates having the names of 
the twelve tribes of Israel; a breastplate having 
12  stones  that  represented  the  twelve  tribes  
of  Israel;  and  the  “Urim  and  Thummim”  placed  
in a pocket of the ephod. (We don’t know what 

The Parts of the Tabernacle                                                                                                                      75
Exodus
exactly the “Urim and Thummim” were. But they were used by the high 
priest to find God’s will for the Israelites. They were like traffic lights that 
told the Israelites when to “Go”, when to “Stop” and when to “Wait”).
These three items symbolised Christ’s power supporting us, His love 
caring  for  us,  and  His  wisdom  guiding  us.  These  three  are  brought  
together in 2 Timothy 1:7 as the virtues that the Spirit of God commu-
nicates to us today. 
The shoulder-plate teaches  us  that  we  too,  as  God’s  servants  must  
carry other people on our shoulders, lifting their burdens, like we carry 
little children on our shoulders. The breastplate teaches us that we too 
must carry God’s people on our hearts, and love them and have a concern 
for them.
A  true  prophet,  will  carry  God’s  people  on  his  heart  and  also  have  
God’s word in his heart. 
The  high  priest  also  had  to  wear  a  golden  plate  on  his  forehead  
(attached to his turban) that had these words engraved on it, “HOLINESS 
UNTO THE LORD”. Thus Aaron was to bear the guilt found in “the holy 
offerings” of Israel (28:36–38). There is sin even in our “holy offerings”! 
Jesus carried not only our filthy sins, but also the sins in our holy things. 
Some  examples  of  the  sins  in  our  holy activities  are:  preaching  to  get  
honour  or  money,  praying  to  impress  people,  doing  good  things  with  
selfish motives, etc. 
On the day of atonement (which was once a year), the high priest took 
off all these colourful clothes and went into the most holy place wearing 
only  a  simple  white dress.  When  he  came  
out  of  the  most  holy  place,  he  had  to  put  on  
his  colourful  clothes  once  again  before  going  
before the people (Ezekiel 44:19). This symbol-
ises that when we go before the Lord, we must 
go in simplicity and humility and brokenness. 
But when we come before the people, we must 
anoint our face, and hide our sacrifices and 
our  praying  and  our  fasting  from  them.  Our  
holy  white  dress  must  be  worn  before  God  
alone.  We  must  appear  to  men  as  though  we  
have been feasting, not fasting!
When I started serving the Lord full-time, I 
decided that even when I had no money, I would 
act as if I had plenty. That way, no-one would 
ever  give  me  any  gifts  out  of  pity  or  charity. 
Many  Christian  workers  give  the  impression  
(through  their  appearance  and  their  prayer-  
letters)  that  they  are  poor,  and  thus  receive  

76 Through the Bible: The Nation of Israel is Born
Exodus
gifts from others just like beggars receive gifts – as acts of charity. But 
there is a dignity about one who is a servant of the Lord of heaven and 
earth and he must not make himself an object of charity. He must anoint 
his face and appear as though he has everything he needs. His Master is 
well able to supply all His need without any charitable gifts from people! 
So let us take off our simple white clothes when we go before the people 
and wear colourful clothes before them always!
Three Levels of Christian Living 
The three parts of the tabernacle – outer court, holy place and most holy 
place – can also be taken to symbolise three levels at which we can live 
the Christian live – in the following seven different areas:
(a) Three stages of spiritual growth: 
1. forgiven by God;
2. serving God; and
3. fellowshipping with God. 
(b) Three types of Christians: 
1. a carnal Christian;
2. a soulish Christian; and
3. a spiritual Christian
(c) Three ministries of the Holy Spirit:
1. born of the Holy Spirit; 
2. baptised in the Holy Spirit; and
3. led by the Holy Spirit daily.
(d) Three attitudes towards God: 
1. thanksgiving;
2. praise; and
3. worship.
In thanksgiving,  we  think  of  God’s  gifts  that  we have  received  and  
been blessed by. In praise, we think of God’s greatness and almighty 
power  that  are  exercised  on  our behalf.  But  in  worship,  our  focus  
shifts to God Himself, and we adore Him for Who He is.
(e) Three levels of light:
1. human reason;
2. the teaching of God’s Word; and
3. God’s nature.
All of us live our lives by the understanding that we receive from one 
or more of the above three sources. The light in the outer court and 
holy place was created light – sun (outer court) and lampstand (holy 
place). But the light in the most holy place was the uncreated light 
of God’s own presence.

Three Levels of Christian Living                                                                                                                77
Exodus
(f) Three levels of fruitfulness: 
1. thirty-fold;
2. sixty-fold; and
3. hundred-fold.
The good ground in the parable of the sower was also of 3 types – as 
with the bad ground (Mark 4:1–8). The measure of fruitfulness in the 
good ground depended on the measure of wholeheartedness.
(g) Three levels of Christian maturity:
1. babes;
2. young men;
3. fathers.
Babes are dependent on others. Young men are zealous. Fathers are 
full of love and wisdom (1 John 2:12–14).
The way into the most holy place is through the rent veil of the yielded 
human will. That veil does not have to be rent today, for it has already 
been  rent  by  our  Lord  (Hebrews  10:20).  But  we  have  to  walk  that  way  
every day, if we are to fellowship with the Father in the most holy place. 
God’s will is that we should live in His presence every day. 
The way of the cross is a way and not a goal. Our goal is not death to 
self, but fellowship with the Father.
So we do not major on the message of the cross but rather on the 
message of fellowship with the Father. 
May we live in that blessed fellowship all our days.



LEVITICUS
The Holiness of God
T
his is really one of the most difficult books to study and to get 
something for the heart from. But it is the inspired word of God. So 
God has something for us in it. 
Leviticus is a book that speaks of the holiness of God. It’s a book that 
has holiness as its main theme throughout. 
Holiness is a word a lot of believers are afraid of. But we must boldly 
proclaim the standards of God’s Word – for they are all realistic and 
attainable. 
Holiness is the very nature of God. The Spirit God gives us is a Holy 
Spirit. When Isaiah got a vision of God, he saw Him in His holiness and 
saw himself as an unclean man. 
Holiness is like health. How many of you are afraid to hear messages 
on  being  perfectly  healthy?  Are  we  afraid  of  good  health?  No.  Then  
why should we be afraid of perfect health in our spirit – which is more 
important than health for our body? Sin is like sickness. We see that in 
Leviticus. The Lord gives rules here concerning holiness and concerning 
health. The two are similar - one is for the spirit and one is for the body. 
Holiness for the body is what we call health. Health for the spirit and soul 
is what we call holiness. So we need to get rid of this fear of holiness. And 
we must come to the place where we desire total holiness more than we 
desire total health. Just like we want to be totally free of all sickness in 
our bodies, we must want to be totally free of all sin that defiles us.
We must not tolerate sin any more than we tolerate sickness. To toler-
ate  dirty  thoughts  is  like  tolerating  tuberculosis  or  leprosy.  To  tolerate  
anger by justifying ourselves saying, “That’s my weakness or that’s my 
temperament”  and  thus  to  permit  it  in  our  lives,  is  like  making  allow-
ance for AIDS or syphilis in our body. Sin and sickness are very similar. 

80 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God80 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God
Leviticus
For  example,  in  Leviticus, God  tells  the  Israelites  how  to  deal  with  a  
person having leprosy and similar skin diseases. That is a type of sin in 
this book and the laws given here relate to how to deal with sin.
The words ‘holiness’ and ‘holy’ appear in this book nearly 100 times, 
emphasising that that is the main theme of this book. A book of 27 chap-
ters where holiness is mentioned 100 times must certainly be an important 
book. But this book has no stories like many of the other books of the 
Bible.  There  are  not  many  interesting  verses  or  promises  either.  But  
there is a lot of description of offerings, feasts and things like that. I want 
to bring out some of the important parts of this book and explain them 
to you. I also want to explain some of the offerings and feasts described 
in this book and see how they apply to us in this new covenant age. We 
know from Hebrews that God has finished with all offerings and sacri-
fices. But those sacrifices pointed to Christ and to us, and therefore, it is 
good for us to see how they apply to us and what they symbolise – just as 
we saw with the tabernacle in the last chapter.
The Five Offerings
Chapters  1  to  7  of Leviticus describe five offerings.  All  of  them  picture  
Christ and His perfect life and His death. God does not want us to think 
only of Christ’s death, but also of His perfect life, because there are some 
offerings described here in which no blood is shed. Those offerings obvi-
ously do not refer to Calvary, but to Jesus’ perfect life. That shows that 
God wants us to think much about His life too. Many Christians think 
only of the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross. But what we learn from 
Leviticus is that He made many sacrifices in His life too. He offered His 
life day by day to His Father, pouring out His own will and His soul-life 
to death. 
Two of these five offerings were mandatory (compulsory) – the sin offer-
ing and the guilt offering. 
The other three offerings were voluntary – the burnt offering, the grain 
offering and the peace offering. 
The first offering mentioned in Leviticus 1 is the burnt offering – which 
is  a  picture  of  our  offering  ourselves  totally  to  God.  The  burnt  offering  
had to be first cut into pieces to ensure that there was no defect in any 
part of it – and then it was offered. People could offer a bullock or a sheep 
or a goat or even a dove or a pigeon, according to their financial ability. 
But each offering had to be without any blemish or defect.
The burnt offering is a picture of the way Jesus presented His body, 
throughout His earthly life, to His Father – and then finally on the cross 
as well. All through His earthly life, He kept His body perfectly pure in 
every temptation before He presented it to His Father as a sacrifice on 
the cross. God would not have accepted Jesus’ offering up of Himself on 
the cross if there was a single spot in His earthly life during the previous 

The Five Offerings                                                                                                                                       81The Five Offerings                                                                                                                                       81
Leviticus
33½  years.  This  was  why  when  He  was  hungry,  He  did  not  turn  the  
stones into bread. That would have been a sin, because the Father had 
not told Him to do it. His life was one of total dependence and total obedi-
ence. Jesus never did anything without the Father’s prompting, even if it 
appeared to be a harmless thing like turning stones into bread to satisfy 
one’s hunger! That is the standard of obedience to which God calls us. 
That is why Jesus’ life was so triumphant, and that was why the Father 
was so delighted with Him. 
Consider  yet  another  example:  In  Luke  4:38–42,  we  read  of  a  great  
revival in a town. The next morning, the multitude pressed Him to stay 
on there and to continue the revival meetings. But Jesus said, “No.” Why? 
Because, before He met the people that morning, He had met with His 
Father in the wilderness and He had heard the voice of His Father telling 
Him to go elsewhere. So, He would not yield to the pressure of the multi-
tudes but went where the Father told Him to go. If He had yielded to the 
multitudes and conducted revival meetings, he would have sinned! Have 
you got such an understanding of sin yet? 
How  many  of  us  believe  that  conducting  revival  meetings  could  be  
sinful!! That was the level of sensitivity to sin at which Jesus lived. We 
normally think of sins as things like getting angry, having dirty thoughts, 
being jealous or bitter etc. These are also sins – but at the kindergarten 
level. Jesus was dealing with sin at the Doctorate (Ph.D.) level. Did you 
know  that  if  God  has  not  called  you  to  go  and  take  meetings  at  some  
place and you do that, you are sinning? 
But  we  can’t  reach  this  Doctorate  level  overnight!  We  have  to  make  
gradual progress from one class to the next, year by year. As we progress, 
we will discover that a lot of things we never considered as sin earlier, 
now become sin for us. When “sin becomes utterly sinful” (Romans 7:13), 
we can be certain that we are growing spiritually! 
So,  when  we  look  at  Jesus’  life,  we  don’t  think  only  of  His  death  at  
Calvary,  but  also  of  His  whole  life  where  He  presented  Himself  to  the  
Father  fully  saying,  “A body Thou hast prepared for Me ... and I have 
come to do Thy will O God (in this body)” (Hebrews 10:5, 7). Jesus never 
once did His own will in his body but only the Father’s. This is what it 
means to offer oneself as a burnt offering to God.
This is what Paul exhorts us also to do in Romans 12:1. “Present your 
bodies a living and holy sacrifice to God ... that you may prove what the 
will of God is” – exactly as Jesus did. This burnt offering was pres-
ented to God and burnt completely. The Bible says this was “a soothing 
aroma  to  the  Lord”  (1:17) –  meaning  something  that  God  was  very  
pleased with – “This is My Beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased.”
Paul  said  that  his  life’s  ambition  too  was  to  “please  the  Lord” 
(2 Corinthians 5:9).

Leviticus
When we present our bodies to the Lord, it is very easy to say, “Lord, I 
give my body totally to You.” But we don’t know whether we have offered 
it all, until we “cut it up”. We could be deceiving ourselves. What does it 
mean to cut it up and offer it piece by piece – as was done with the burnt 
offering? It means that we offer our bodily parts piece by piece to God. 
We say, “Lord, here are my eyes. I have used them for the devil and for 
myself  for  the  past  many  years,  looking  at  and  reading  many  things  
that  offended  You.  But  I  am  laying  my  eyes  on  the  altar  now.  Never  
again do I want to use these eyes to look at or read anything that You 
would  not  look  at  or  read.  I  never  want  to  sin  with  these  eyes  any  
more.”
We go next to the tongue and say, “Lord, here is my tongue. I have used 
this  tongue  for  the  devil  and  for  myself  for  so  many  years,  speaking  
whatever I liked, telling lies for my own gain, getting angry at people 
and gossiping and backbiting against others and accusing them. But I 
never want to do all that any more. Here is my tongue Lord. It is yours 
from this moment onwards – totally and completely.”
We go next to our hands and our feet and our bodily passions, one by 
one, and say the same thing: “Lord, here are the members of my body 
and my bodily passions, with which I have sinned and hurt You. Never 
again  do  I  want  to  use  these  to  please  myself  or  to  satisfy  my  lusts.  
They are all Yours.”
It is only as we cut each piece and lay them on the altar one by one, that 
we discover whether we really are offering our body totally to God or not.
When the offering is cut into pieces and laid out on the altar fully, then 
you can say, “Now, Lord, let Your fire fall on the sacrifice and consume 
it.”  We  read  in  Leviticus  9:24  how the fire of God fell upon the burnt 
offering and consumed it. That fire is a picture of the baptism in the Holy 
Spirit and fire that comes to consume our sacrifice and to set our bodies 
on fire for God. But the fire never fell until every last piece of the burnt 
offering was placed on the altar.
What do Christians do when they don’t want to pay the price of yield-
ing their bodies as a burnt offering and yet want to get the fire? They 
manufacture a false fire – a counterfeit one. And that is what we see in 
Leviticus 10:1, 2: “Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took firepans 
and put fire in them and offered strange fire before the Lord which He 
had  not  commanded  them.” When we don’t have the real fire of God, 
and we want to be a part of those who have the real fire, the danger is 
that we will imitate what they have so as to be able to say, “Yes, we also 
got the fire. We also spoke in tongues!” God was so angry with Nadab 

The Five Offerings                                                                                                                                       83The Five Offerings                                                                                                                                       83
Leviticus
and Abihu for imitating the real fire that He sent down another fire 
from His presence – this time not to consume the burnt offering but to 
consume these two hypocrites! 
It is dangerous to imitate the real thing in spiritual matters. Yet, multi-
tudes of Christians are doing this, these days. They are being coached by 
preachers to speak in tongues, to work up their emotions and to expe-
rience psychosomatic “healings” (imagining that these are the same as 
being healed “in the Name of Jesus.”).
Those who have obtained the real fire from God have paid a price for it. 
They laid everything on the altar of God – their money, their eyes, their 
tongue, their hands, their all. They examined their lives and made sure 
that every piece of the burnt offering was on the altar; and God sent His 
fire on them. You watch the life of such a man, and you wish you had 
the  same  powerful  anointing.  But  you  are  not  willing  to  pay  the  same  
price for it; you still want to show others that you are anointed. It is then 
that you can do what Nadab and Abihu did – produce strange fire, work 
up your emotions, manufacture “tongues” etc. Since more than 95% of 
believers don’t have spiritual discernment, you may be able to fool them 
that you have the real fire. But you know better than anyone else that 
what you have is self-produced and not from God. Beware!
If God were to judge Christendom today in the way He judged Nadab 
and Abihu, I am sure that a lot of Christians would die. 
The second offering  is  the  ‘grain  offering’  (Leviticus  2).  There  was  no  
blood in this offering. No animal was slain. It was an offering of flour, 
roasted  grain,  salt  and  oil.  One  of  the  things  the  Lord  said  in  connec-
tion with this offering was “Don’t use any leaven.” (verse 11). Leaven is a 
picture of sin throughout the Scriptures. But The Lord told them to add 
salt. Salt is a picture of an eternal covenant. Numbers 18:19 reads: “It is 
an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord.” Whenever you read of salt 
being offered in the Bible and Jesus mentioning it in the New Testament 
too,  remember  it  refers  to  this  everlasting  covenant  mentioned  here  in  
Numbers. We use salt to preserve things for a long time. That is why the 
Lord  uses  it  to  refer  to  that  which  is  everlasting.  So  the  salt  that  was  
added  to  the  grain  offering  indicated  that  the  offerer  was  committing  
himself to the Lord forever – not just for 5 years or even 50 years! It is like 
a marriage – an everlasting covenant.
The third offering is the peace offering (Leviticus 3). The offerer had to 
bring the animal and lay his hand on its head (verse 2). Thereby, he was 
confessing that through the death of that animal he had come to peace 
with  God.  “Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with 
God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Romans 5:1). Peace in our conscience 
is of vital importance in the Christian life. God does not want any of His 
children  to  live  in  uncertainty  about  His  accepting  them.  We  must  be  
absolutely  convinced  that  our  sins  are  all forgiven.  There  must  be  no  

84 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God84 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God
Leviticus
feelings of guilt in our lives whatsoever. Just like this man laid his hand 
on the animal, we also lay our hands on the Lord at Calvary, and believe 
that He paid the price for all our sins and cleared our debt completely and 
tore up our certificate of debt at Calvary (Colossians 2:14). So now, like 
our Lord said on the cross, we too can say, “It is finished.” God’s promise 
to us is, “Your sins and iniquities I will remember no more.” Hallelujah! The 
New Testament speaks about entering into God’s rest and dwelling there 
at all times (Hebrews 4). Do you know that God has accepted you just as 
you are – not after you have changed, but just as you are. This is what 
brings rest into our lives. This is what is symbolised in the peace offering.
The fourth offering is the sin offering (Chapter 4). It’s very interesting 
to note that only ‘unintentional sin’ is mentioned here. “If a person sins 
unintentionally in any of the things which the Lord has commanded...” 
(verse 2). It may be the anointed priest who sinned (See verse 3). He too 
has to bring a sin offering to the Lord. It may be a leader who has sinned 
(verse  22).  Some  Christian  leaders  act  as  though  they  don’t  sin  at  all!!  
When God judges sin, He always begins with the leaders and the priests. 
They must settle their scores with God first.
If  you  were  one  of  the  ordinary  Israelites  and  you  saw  the  leader  of  
your tribe bringing an offering to the altar, you may be surprised and say 
to yourself, “This man is our leader, but he has sinned too.” That would 
encourage  you  to  believe  that  God  chooses  ordinary  people  like  you  to  
be His leaders. Don’t we all sin? Is there a man on earth who does not 
sin?  Don’t  give  people  the  impression  then  that  you  are  perfect,  when  
you know you are not. One thing that encourages me about the stories of 
godly men in the Bible is that the Bible does not hide their mistakes. We 
have seen that in the lives of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The apostle Paul 
made mistakes too and he told his co-worker Luke (who wrote the Acts 
record) not to hide any of them. So Luke wrote faithfully that Paul fought 
with Barnabas, that he circumcised Timothy, that he shaved his head to 
fulfil a Jewish vow, and that he shouted at the high priest towards the 
end of his life, etc. These things are written for our encouragement, so 
that we realise that great men of God also make mistakes and fall into sin. 
Most  modern  biographies,  however,  never  speak  the  whole  truth.  They  
make those men look as if they never made any mistakes in their lives. 
Such biographies don’t encourage anyone. The Scriptures, however, are 
honest. Leaders do sin and need to settle matters with God and man – 
just like everybody else.
I am not asking you leaders to confess your sins in public. No. But I 
am saying that you shouldn’t give people the impression that you never 
make a mistake or sin. If you never apologise to anybody in your church 
then that is the impression that you are giving. Personally, I have had 
to apologise numerous times to my wife, to my children, to people in my 
church,  and  even  to  young  people  who  are  younger  than  my  youngest  
son – all because of one reason: I am not God. There is only one person 

The Five Offerings                                                                                                                                       85The Five Offerings                                                                                                                                       85
Leviticus
who  never  needs  to  apologise  to  anyone  –  and  that  is  God  Himself.  So  
humble yourself and ask for forgiveness from those whom you have hurt. 
They will respect you even more for that.
When  an  anointed  priest  sinned,  he  had  to  bring  an  offering  to  the  
doorway  of  the  tent  (verse  4).  He  could  not  do  it  privately  or  in  secret  
saying, “I am an anointed priest and my reputation will go down if I do 
this  publicly.”  He  had  to  confess  his  sin  right  there  in  front  of  all  the  
people, at the doorway of the tent. He had to lay his hand on the head of 
the bull and admit that he had sinned, and take some of the blood of the 
bull, dip his finger in it and offer it to the Lord.
I  want  you  to  notice  one  interesting  thing  here  in  4:13,  14:  “If  the  
whole congregation of Israel commits a sin and it has escaped the notice 
of the assembly, and they commit any of the things, they also must bring 
a bull.” Now there are different offerings mentioned here – for a leader 
who sinned (4:22), and for a common person who sinned (4:27). When a 
common person sinned, he had to bring only a female goat (4:28), which 
was not very expensive. But if the whole congregation sinned, they had 
to bring a bull (more expensive). If the priest sinned he also had to bring 
a bull. Notice here that the offering for a sinning priest was the same as 
for a sinning congregation. A leader sinning was not like a common man 
sinning.  No.  It  was  equivalent  to  the  whole  congregation  sinning.  Both  
had to bring a bull.
A  lot  of  people  don’t  realise  that  God  does  not  look  at  all  same  sins  
in  the  same  way.  When  an  anointed  leader  sins  in  some  way,  and  a  
common  man  sins  in  exactly  the  same  way,  they  are  not equal  sins  in  
God’s eyes. The sin of the anointed priest is far more serious. He has to 
bring a bull, whereas the common man has to only bring a female goat. 
The more anointed we are and the more we teach others (as the old cove-
nant priests did), the more we are answerable to God for our lives. “To 
whom more is given, from him more will be required.” (Luke 12:48).
Notice that the sin offering is prescribed only for unintentional sin (See 
4:2, 13, 22, 27). Look at the warning given in Hebrews 10:26. “If we 
go on sinning intentionally, there is no more sacrifice for sin.” This is in 
keeping with Leviticus 4. If you have truly turned to the Lord and have 
become  one  of  God’s  children,  you  will  not  want  to  sin.  That  is  one  
mark of being born again. We may sin. In fact, we all do sin unknow-
ingly. But if we are born again, we will never want to sin again. We don’t 
take  advantage  of  God’s  mercy  and  goodness.  One  who  sins  against  
God  because  he  knows  that  he  can  get  forgiveness  easily,  is  almost  
certainly not born again. A born-again Christian may fall into sin, but 
he hates sin.
But we must all confess that we have all sinned deliberately too, even 
after we have been born again. What about those sins? Hebrews 10:26 is 

86 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God86 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God
Leviticus
referring to continuing in sin and not to the occasional act: “If we go on 
sinning wilfully,” refers to continuously taking advantage of God’s good-
ness. Then there is no more sacrifice for sin, but only a looking forward 
for God’s judgement (Hebrews 10:27).
The fifth offering  is  the  guilt  offering  (Chapter  5).  This  refers  to  sins  
committed not only against God, but also against other human beings. 
Certain sins are only against God. If, for example, we have dirty thoughts, 
we don’t harm anybody else. Such sins are only against God. If we have 
wrong  motives,  we  sin  only  against  God.  But  many  sins  involve  other  
people too. Here in verse 1, it speaks of someone who refuses to testify 
about something he has seen or known, perhaps because it will implicate 
his friend, and as a result an innocent person is punished, then the first 
man is guilty of a sin against God and against man. Other similar sins 
are mentioned in the following verses.
In verse 16, restitution is mentioned: “He shall make restitution for that 
which he has sinned against the holy thing and shall add to it a fifth 
part (20%) and give it to the priest.” – if the sin is against the Lord. That 
principle applies even to making restitution to man (as mentioned in 
Numbers 5:6, 7). If you have cheated or robbed someone, then when 
making restitution, you must give him back 20% more than what you 
took from him. This will teach you not to do it again to anyone!
The Lord says one more thing, which I want you to notice here, about 
the guilt offering (7:30), “His own hands are to bring offerings by fire to the 
Lord” You must bring your offering personally, whoever you are – big or 
small. You couldn’t send it through a servant. However great a man you 
may be, you have to come yourself, humble yourself, admit your mistake 
and acknowledge that you have sinned. All are equal before God. 
Holiness and Health
Now we come to a number of chapters that deal with laws on holiness 
and health. All of these show God’s intense interest in the smallest little 
details of a person’s life. We may imagine that God is not interested in 
the small details of our lives. But I find in the book of Leviticus that God 
is interested in every little detail. The Israelites were told here what to do 
even if a lizard fell into a cooking pot. The earthenware pot into which the 
lizard fell should be destroyed and none of the food in it should be eaten, 
for it may produce an infection and bring death. (Leviticus 11:33). God 
also gave them instructions on bathing, when they were defiled in some 
way – they were to bathe in running water (Leviticus 15:13). He also told 
them to wash their clothes when they were defiled (Leviticus 15:5, 7, 11 
and Chapter 17 also). These are just two examples of the care that God 
has for His people. Did you ever imagine that God could be so interested

Leviticus
in the food you eat and in your cleanliness – in your bathing habits and 
in your washing your clothes regularly. I am excited to read such things. 
Who said that the book of Leviticus was boring? 
This book also has teaching on sexual purity and a number of other 
interesting subjects. In Chapter 10:8–11, God told Aaron, “Don’t ever 
drink wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons when you come 
into the tent of meeting so that you will not die. That’s how you make 
a distinction between the holy and the profane so as to teach the sons 
of  Israel  all  the  statutes  which  the  Lord  has  spoken.”  God  was  telling  
the leaders that they should not consume anything that would pollute 
their bodies. As leaders, they had to be exemplary in their conduct.
In Chapter 11 God told them about the animals that were clean and 
those  that  were  unclean,  the  type  of  animals  they  could  eat,  and  the  
type of animals they should not eat. What I learn from this passage is 
that God in heaven is interested even in our eating habits – that we have 
healthy  food  habits.  The  Bible  says  in  1  Corinthians  10:31,  “Whatever 
you do, whether you eat or drink, do all to the glory of God”. The essen-
tial message in Leviticus concerning eating and drinking is: “Don’t eat or 
drink  anything  that  is  not  good  for  your  body.”  I  am  sure  that  the  Lord  
would have a lot to say to His children about the junk food that many eat 
and drink today!
There are rules for hygiene too, as for example, in 11:33: “If an animal 
dies and falls into a clay pot, everything in that pot is defiled, and the pot 
must be smashed,” and “If water used to cleanse an unclean object touches 
any food, all of that food is defiled” (11:34). He is telling the Israelites here 
to have hygienic habits and a clean lifestyle. 
We can’t disobey the rules of health and then pray when we are sick, 
“Lord,  please  heal  me.”  That  is  foolishness.  If  you  disobey  the  laws  of  
hygiene that God has made, you have no-one to blame but yourself when 
you  fall  sick.  We  saw  what  God  said  in  Exodus15:26.  “If  you  obey  My  
laws, then I will be your Healer.” God wants to give us the gift of health 
more than healing! But we must obey His laws for our body. 
In Chapter 11:44, we read, “I am the Lord Your God. Consecrate your-
selves therefore and be holy, for I am holy.” This is the main theme of the 
book of Leviticus – and this verse comes right in the middle of the book. 
Peter quotes this verse in 1 Peter 1:16, “We are to be holy, because the 
One who called us is holy.”
Holiness and cleanliness are two of the main themes of Leviticus.
The Cleansing of Lepers
Chapter 13 deals with the test for leprosy: “If a man has on the skin of 
his body a swelling or a scab or a bright spot, and it becomes an infection 

88 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God88 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God
Leviticus
of leprosy on the skin, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to 
one of his sons the priests. The priest shall look at the mark on the skin 
of  the  body,  and  if  the  hair  has  turned  white  and  the  infection  appears  
to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is an infection of leprosy. But if 
the bright spot is white on the skin of his body and it does not appear to 
be deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has not turned white, then the 
priest shall isolate him who has the infection for seven days” (13:2–4).
I  want  you  to  apply  this  not  to  leprosy,  but  to  sin.  It  is  a  precious  
passage. When you see something that you think is sin, in a brother or 
sister, what are you supposed to do? What were the Israelites supposed 
to do here? They were not to pass judgement on it themselves, for they 
could have been wrong. It may not be leprosy. This is the lesson for us 
too. It may not be what you think it is. So take the matter first to the 
Lord (Aaron symbolises Christ here), and then to the elders (Aaron’s sons 
symbolise the elders in the church here). Let them deal with the matter. 
If you follow this simple principle, you can be saved from so much that 
destroys you and others. If an Israelite could only humble himself and 
say,  “I  am  not  a  priest.  So  let  me  take  him  to  God’s  appointed  priest”,  
what a lot of problems could be solved. And if you could humble yourself 
and  do  the  same,  what  a  lot  of  false  rumours  and  confusion  could  be  
avoided in the church! 
We notice here that the priest also does not pass judgement immedi-
ately on the basis of what he hears. Many elders, unfortunately, pass a 
judgement, as soon as they hear a matter, without verifying whether the 
matter is true. The Bible says, “How stupid to decide before knowing the 
facts” (Proverbs18:13 - Living). 
The priest here looks carefully at the person, examines every part, asks 
him questions, and only then determines how serious the case is. What 
peace there would have been in every church if all the elders had followed 
this simple principle taught here!
The Lord says, “Be very careful. It may not be as serious as you think; 
or it may be more serious than you think. So examine the person care-
fully, make full allowance for human error, and then decide whether to 
pronounce him unclean or not.” If the person has to be put out of the 
camp as a leper, do so. This is the way discipline should be carried out 
in any church. After careful examination, finally, if the brother has to 
be put out of the church, then do so. 
Sometimes the priest may not be able to come to a firm conclusion on 
first examination. Then he says, “I am not sure whether this is a serious 
case. Let’s wait for 7 days and I’ll see him again.” (verse 4). Many of us 
don’t like to wait when we see something we think is wrong in a brother 
or sister. But God is concerned that innocent people are not punished – 
both under the old covenant and the new.

The Cleansing of Lepers                                                                                                                             89The Cleansing of Lepers                                                                                                                             89
Leviticus
We  must  see  another  very  important  thing  here:  The  aim  of  the  priest  
was always to bring the leper back into the camp healthy, one day. And so 
the priest would look at the person again after seven days. If he was not 
happy with what he saw, he would ask that the person be brought back 
after another seven days. And if the infection had gone by then, the priest 
would  say,  “Praise  the  Lord.  He  is  clean  now.  He  can  now  have  a  bath,  
wash his clothes and come back to the camp once again.” (verse 4–6). If, 
however, he was still not clean, then for the sake of protecting the others 
in the camp, he would be put outside the camp and isolated. No doubt, the 
priest would examine him once again after some more days. Do you see 
the attitude of the priest here? His aim was to try and keep the man inside 
the camp as far as possible. Only as a last resort would he put him out.
And that, Jesus said, must be our attitude to an erring brother – “win 
your  brother”  (Matthew  18:15).  Try  every  method  possible  to  save  him  
from  his  sin.  If  nothing  succeeds,  then  put  him  out  (Matthew  18:17; 
1  Corinthians  5:13).  But  even  after  he  has  been  put  out,  if  he  repents  
sincerely, bring him back into the fellowship of the church (2 Corinthians 
2:6–11).
 This unfortunately, is so different from the attitude that I have seen 
in  many  churches  today,  where  they  not  only  tear  believers  apart,  but  
also drag them down. If you want to be a new-covenant leader, learn how 
to  deal  both  in  kindness and  in  strictness  with  sinners  in  the  church  
(Romans 11:22).
There is an amazing truth here in 13:12, 13: “If the leprosy breaks out 
further on the skin and the leprosy covers all the skin from his head 
to  his  foot,  then  the  priest  shall  look  and  if  the  skin  disease  has  
covered  all  his  body,”  –  then  what?  Is  the  man  clean  or  unclean?  
The answer may surprise us. He is clean! How can that be? If his skin 
is all white, it’s clean. But if the raw flesh appears again, then he is 
unclean again (verse 14). What is the meaning of this? The application 
for us is just this: If a man acknowledges that he is a good-for-nothing 
sinner,  absolutely  rotten  from  head  to  foot,  and  admits  that  there is 
nothing good in him, then he is clean in the Lord’s eyes. But if he says, 
“No, I am not all that bad. I have some good spots in my life,” – then he 
is unclean. 
You know how most people react when they are told that the Bible says 
that they are good-for-nothing, rotten sinners who deserve nothing but 
hell-fire. They reply, “I am not all that bad. I have some good points in my 
life” Such a person is unclean in God’s eyes. But if his reaction is, “God is 
absolutely right. There is nothing good in my flesh. My best actions come 
from corrupt motives. I am rotten through and through” – in other words, 
if he does not justify himself at all – then he is totally clean in God’s eyes. 
This is the good news of the gospel. This is why wicked murderers and 

90 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God90 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God
Leviticus
adulteresses (whose “whole skin was covered with leprosy”) were forgiven 
by the Lord, but the self-righteous Pharisees were not. The bits of raw 
flesh in those Pharisees (their self justification) made them unclean. 
In Chapter  14  we  read  about  the  cleansing  of  this  leper.  We  see  an  
amazing thing in verses 14. When the leper is cleansed, the priest takes 
some blood from the guilt offering and puts a drop of it on the lobe of the 
cleansed leper’s right ear, another drop on the thumb of his right hand 
and another drop on the big toe of his right foot. This symbolises total 
cleansing of every part of our being through the blood of Christ. Now if 
you look at Leviticus 8:23, you will notice that this was the very thing that 
Moses did for Aaron the high-priest too! In other words, the same privi-
lege that the high priest had was given to this leper as well! The message 
of the gospel is this – that we who are such filthy, rotten sinners are loved 
by God just as much as He loves Jesus, and accepted by Him just as much 
as Jesus is! Unbelievable and amazing, but nevertheless true!
In verses 17 and 18, we read of two more steps in this cleansing process 
for  the  leper.  First,  the  priest  put  a  drop  of  oil  on  the  same  three  spots  
where he had earlier put the blood – the right ear lobe, the right thumb 
and the right toe. This symbolises being born of the Holy Spirit. Then the 
priest poured the rest of the oil on the cleansed leper’s head. This symbol-
ises the baptism in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit being poured out on us.
This  is  indeed  an  amazing  gospel:  A  leprous  sinner  is  cleansed  from  
head to foot first of all through the blood of Christ, brought to new birth 
through  the  Holy  Spirit  and  then  has  the  Holy  Spirit  poured  out  upon  
him.  Right  here  in  Leviticus  14:17,  18  is  a  foreshadowing  of  these  two  
vital ministries of the Holy Spirit – bringing us to new birth, and enduing 
us  with  His  power.  So  let  us,  who  are  cleansed  “lepers”,  not  stop  with  
having received the drop of blood and the drop of oil! Let us be open also 
to receive the outpouring of the oil on our heads.
All this and more are all pictured there in the book of Leviticus. What 
you may have considered to be a boring book turns out to be more inter-
esting than you thought.
There are many little things mentioned also here concerning showing 
respect for older people, treating strangers with consideration, and reject-
ing fortune telling and witchcraft etc. that have a lot of application for our 
daily lives.
In Chapter 21:16–24, we are told that anyone who had “a defect” could 
not be a priest, even if he was a son of Aaron. This teaches us that even 
if a person is a child of God, if there is some defect (“unsettled sin”) in his 
life, he cannot be an elder or leader. God’s servants should be free from 
such “defects”. God has very high standards for those who stand before 
His people as His representatives. Under the old covenant, those stand-
ards were all physical, because those leaders had to lead the Israelites 
into  a  physical kingdom. In  our  day,  those  standards  are  all  spiritual, 
because we are to lead God’s people into a spiritual kingdom.

Leviticus
The Seven Feasts
In Chapter  23  we  read  about  the  seven  feasts  that  God  ordained  the  
Israelites.  We  saw  the  five offerings in  the  early  part  of  Leviticus.  God  
wanted to teach His people that religion was not a boring affair. It was to 
be an enjoyable and exciting thing – something that they could practice 
with  joy.  So  He  ordained  these  feasts  (or  festivals)  for  them.  One  of  the  
Hebrew words translated as “festival” was the word “hag” meaning “dance” 
and that is what God expected His people to do!! The number seven has a 
significance here. Every seventh day, every seventh month, every seventh 
year and also the year that came after seven times seven years (50
th
 year) 
was a festival time. All these feasts were between April and October each 
year. God also selected a time of the year when the weather would be clear 
and when the farmers would not be busy in their fields, so that they could 
all go to Jerusalem for these feasts. The commands of God are all realistic 
and He is considerate of all our earthly needs.
Here is a list of the seven feasts:
1. The Sabbath: This was at the end of six days of work, every week. On 
this day, no work was to be done. The day was meant to be spent, as 
Adam spent his first day – in fellowship with God. It symbolises the 
rest that Christ brings us into in our relationship with God.
2. The  Passover-Feast:  The  Passover was on  the  14
th
 day of their first 
month,  in  which  they  remembered  the  time  when  God  saved  their  
forefathers  from  Egypt  by  the  blood  of  the  lamb  –  a  picture  of  our  
deliverance from Satan’s kingdom by the blood of Christ. 
3. The  Feast  of  Unleavened  Bread:  This  followed  immediately  after  the  
Passover  –  for  seven  days  –  during  which  they  ate  only  unleavened  
bread. It reminded them about the leavened bread that their fathers 
left behind in Egypt – a picture of our old life left behind when we are 
converted. This symbolises the cleansed life (free from leaven) that we 
are called to live in, under the new covenant.
4. The  Feast  of  Pentecost:  This  is  also  called  “the  feast  of  weeks”  and  
was  to  be  held  50  days  after  the  feast  of  unleavened  bread  began.  
(“Pentekoste” means “fiftieth”). That was a feast expressing thankful-
ness to God at the end of the barley and wheat harvest. The outpouring 
of the Holy Spirit took place on this day 1500 years later – and this is 
what this feast symbolises (Acts 2:1). Two loaves of bread were offered 
to God on this day symbolising that Jew and Gentile would be united 
on  this  day  many  years  later.  Both  the  loaves  were  leavened  and  
salted indicating that there was still sin in those who were born again 
(leaven), but yet God had made an eternal covenant with them (salt).
5. The Feast of Trumpets: It was the beginning of the seventh month and 
they used trumpets in Israel to gather people to worship, and for war, 

92 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God92 Through the Bible: The Holiness of God
Leviticus
and sometime in the wilderness when they had to move on. It was a 
time of celebration where it was a time of expressing their joy before 
God and thanksgiving to God. This feast symbolises the day when the 
last trumpet shall sound and the Lord will return for His people.
6. The Day of Atonement: This was the most important day in the whole 
year. This was the only day in the year in which the high-priest could 
enter the Most Holy Place in the tabernacle. He looked forward to this 
day and would prepare himself for many hours to be ready for it. He 
wore his white dress only on this day of the year. On the mercy seat, 
he would offer the blood of the sacrifice upon the altar as an atone-
ment for the sins of the nation of Israel. This feast looked forward to 
the  great  day  of  atonement  on  Calvary,  when  our  great  High  Priest  
offered Himself for our sins.
7. The  Feast  of  Tabernacles:  This  was  also  called  “the  feast  of  booths”, 
when the Israelites lived for seven days in little shelters and reminded 
themselves of how their forefathers wandered in the wilderness. Thus 
they  expressed  their  thanksgiving  to  God  for  the  good  houses  they  
lived in now. It may be good for us to live like that for a week every 
year so that we don’t complain about the little problems we have in 
our good houses! This feast symbolises the time when the kingdom of 
God will be on earth with Jesus reigning as King.
The most important of these seven feasts, for which all the men had to 
go up to Jerusalem were the feasts of Unleavened Bread, Pentecost and 
Tabernacles (Deuteronomy 16:16).
Apart from these feasts there were also many other Sabbaths. Every 
seventh  year  was  to  be  a  sabbath  of  rest  for  the  land,  in  which  the  
Israelites were not to sow their fields or prune their vineyards (Leviticus 
25:4). The Lord warned them that if they disobeyed this law, He would 
punish them by allowing enemies to take them away as slaves, so that 
the land would then enjoy its sabbath rest during those years (Chapter 
26:34, 35)! The Israelites disobeyed this commandment of God for 490 
years and so God sent them into captivity to Babylon for exactly 70 years 
so that their lands would have the commanded sabbath rest for 70 years 
(2 Chronicles 36:20, 21)! If we do not take God’s Word seriously, we suffer 
the consequences.
In Chapter  27,  instructions  are  given  for  those  who  want  to  give  a  
voluntary  gift  to  the  Lord,  or  make  a  special  vow  to  Him,  or  dedicate  
something  to  the  Lord  (verse  2).  Thus  far  in  Leviticus,  the  Lord  had  
commanded the Israelites to make specific offerings to Him. These were 
mandatory. But the Lord also gave them the privilege to offer voluntary, 
freewill offerings to Him, out of gratitude. They could give their house to 
the  Lord  (verse  14)  or  a  piece  of  their  ancestral  property  (verse  16),  or  
a field that they had bought (verse 22), or his animals. If later on, they

Leviticus
wanted to redeem any of these back, the Lord gave instructions as to how 
this was to be done. They usually had to pay 20% more than its value to 
get it back (verses 15, 19, 27, 31).
In  the  last  three  verses  of  the  book  (27:32–34),  we  read  something  
interesting to deliver the Israelites from covetousness. One tenth of their 
herds and their flock was to be given to the Lord. They were to let their 
animals  pass  under  a  rod,  one  by  one,  before  the  priest.  Every  tenth  
animal was to be given to the Lord. But if the tenth animal was a really 
good, fat one, they were not allowed to exchange it for another sick one!! 
As  they  counted  the  animals  one  by  one,  Number  Ten  was  the  Lord’s,  
good or bad! They were not to be cold and calculating and stingy in their 
giving to God. They were to be rich towards God and give to Him cheer-
fully, because the Lord would give back to them much more than He gave 
them.



NUMBERS
Israel’s Wilderness Wanderings 
and Warfare
This is the fourth of the books that Moses wrote, and it deals with Israel’s 
wanderings  and  wars  in  the  wilderness.  This  book  is  called  Numbers 
because  the  people  of  Israel  were  numbered  twice  in  it.  Moses  took  a  
census of the Israelites (Numbers 1:3) who were 20 years old and upwards 
– all who were able to go out to war. They took a census of the families 
once at the beginning of their journey and again towards the end of their 
40-year wandering as well (Chapter 26).
Order and Organisation
In Chapter 2 you have the order in which the camps of Israel were placed. 
God is a God of order, and one of the things we can learn from this is the 
discipline and orderliness that  God  taught  His  people.  Remember  they  
were a bunch of totally undisciplined slaves in Egypt when God led them 
out. So he began to teach them order, cleanliness, and discipline. These 
are very important lessons for a Christian. Many believers don’t have any 
sense of cleanliness or orderliness in their lives or in their homes. There 
is no discipline in the way they spend their time or their money. 
All  such  matters  affect  our  spiritual  growth.  Whatever  experience  of  
the Holy Spirit you may have had, if you are undisciplined in your life, 
you  can  never  become  a  godly  person.  We  see  the  importance  of  that  
orderliness in the details that we read in the book of Numbers. 
If there is a lack of discipline in our lives, we cannot be the men and 
women God wants us to be. Many Christians are ignorant of the Word of 
God, because they do not discipline themselves to study it. You cannot 
know God’s word if you don’t take pains to study it daily, and especially 
in your younger days.

96 Through the Bible: Israel’s Wilderness Wanderings and Warfare
Numbers
In Chapter  7,  for  example,  where  the  details  of  the  offerings  of  the  
leaders are given, much detail is given: how much a silver dish weighed 
and how much a silver bowl weighed. There is a lot of repetition too. But 
what we can learn from that is that God takes interest in each little thing 
that every person offered. Ten different people may have offered exactly 
the  same  thing.  But  God  recorded  what  each  person  gave  separately, 
because  each  person  was  precious  to  God.  This  shows  us  something  
of  the  heart  of  God.  He  is  interested  in  each  individual.  In  the  world  
of  today,  it  is  easy  to  get  lost,  feeling  that  you  are  just  one  among  the  
millions. Then be encouraged by the fact that God sees each individual 
as special.
In Numbers 3:40, 41, we read that God told Moses to number all the 
firstborn males from a month old and upwards, the reason being that all 
these firstborn should have died in Egypt. They escaped because of the 
Lord’s mercy. So they belonged to the Lord. But the Lord said here, “Take 
the Levites for Me instead of the firstborn and the cattle of the Levites 
instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the Israelites.”  So  Moses  
numbered all the firstborn and they were 22,273 in number (verse 43). 
Then he numbered the Levites and they were only 22,000. For the extra 
273 firstborn, a redemption price had to be paid (verses 46, 47).
So the Levites replaced the firstborn who should have belonged to the 
Lord. Now the Levites belonged to the Lord, and the Lord told them, “You 
shall  have  no  inheritance  in  the  land.  I  am  your  inheritance”  (Numbers 
18:20). They were to be exclusively devoted to the Lord’s service.
Chapter 4: Here we read of the sons of Levi who were given responsibil-
ities in the tabernacle. Levi did not choose his own sons to minister in the 
tabernacle. It was God Who chose them. God may choose our children to 
serve Him, but we cannot. We may want our children to serve the Lord in 
some particular form of service. But God Himself must choose them for 
that and call them individually. It was God Who said, “The sons of Levi 
are to have these responsibilities.” Levi had three sons, Kohath, Gershon 
and  Merari.  Earlier  we  saw  how  Aaron’s  sons,  Nadab  and  Abihu  had  
offered strange fire and they were killed. They would have had wonder-
ful  privileges  in  connection  with  the  tabernacle  to  serve  God,  but  they  
missed it. The sons of Kohath, Gershon and Merari had the responsibil-
ity of moving the tabernacle. The most sacred job in the moving of the 
Israelites was given to these three families.
What we learn here is that we cannot take God’s commandments lightly. 
When Uzzah (in David’s time) touched the ark because he thought it 
was falling, God killed him – just because he was not a Levite. He had 
no right to touch the ark. If God has not given us a responsibility in his 
church, we shouldn’t touch it. When I hear believers criticising some 
other church, I say to them, “You are not a prophet to God’s people. So 
that is none of your business. Leave that ministry to the prophets and

the elders.” In the same way, when I hear people criticising someone 
else’s children, I ask them, “Are you their father?” If not, then we must 
learn  to  mind  our  own  business.  When  we  criticise  someone  else’s  
children, we are touching something God has not given us permission 
to touch. Then we are being like Uzzah who had no right to touch the 
ark. The ark could be handled only by certain people. That’s what we 
see here.
Each of these three families was also given a specific task (4:4, 24, 33).
In 7:2, we read that the leaders of Israel made an offering to the Lord. 
All the leaders and their offerings are mentioned in this list. In verse 3 we 
read that they brought “six covered carts and twelve oxen” for the work of 
moving the tabernacle items. When you divide 6 carts between 3  families 
–  the  Kohathites,  Gershonites  and  Merarites  –  each  family  should  get  
2   carts. When you divide 12 oxen among 3 families, each family should 
get  4  oxen.  But  just  see  how  Moses  divides  them.  We  read  that  Moses  
gave 2 carts and 4 oxen to the sons of Gershon for their service (verse 7). 
Then he gave 4 carts and 8 oxen to the sons of Merari (verse 8). And he 
did not give any carts or any oxen to the sons of Kohathites, because they 
had to carry the ark on their shoulders (verse 9). 
It  would  have  been  very  easy  for  those  Kohathites  to  say,  “God  has  
given four carts to the Merarites, but he has given us none.” Today also 
we find that God chooses to give cars to some of His children and only 
bicycles to others. It is easy for those who have bicycles to question God, 
to complain, and to covet what their brothers have. But God is all-wise 
and  He  never  makes  a  mistake.  He  does  everything  perfectly.  Don’t  
bypass these precious verses hidden in the middle of Numbers. There is 
a message here for us that can deliver us from complaining when we see 
someone else having four cars and we ourselves having none. How rele-
vant these Old Testament books are for our problems today.
Various Laws
In Numbers  5:2,  we  read,  “Command  the  sons  of  Israel  that  they  send  
away  from  the  camp  every  leper  and  everyone  having  a  discharge  and  
everyone  who  is  unclean  because  of  a  dead  person.”  Some  Christians  
imagine (and teach) that because the Lord said in Exodus 15:26, “I the 
Lord am your Healer,” all that the Israelites did whenever they were sick 
was to pray to the Lord and get healed. But this is not true. Here we read 
of lepers who were not healed, but put outside the camp. The Word does 
not say as some preachers would say today: “Command the lepers to trust 
in the Lord as their Healer and to claim their healing in Jehovah’s Name”!! 
No! They were to be put outside the camp. Could the Lord have healed 
them? Certainly. But He didn’t. He commanded them to be put outside 
the camp.

Numbers
We must be honest and realistic when we talk about physical healing. 
Otherwise we will bring many weak believers under condemnation and 
into  bondage.  We  cannot  lock  God  down  into  a  doctrinal  box  and  say:  
“God heals everyone who has faith in Him. No-one who trusts in the Lord 
need ever be sick. Those who are sick, remain sick because they lack faith.” 
People who have taken that unrealistic position have ended causing the 
death of many believers in their churches, who could have been healed if 
they had been treated in a hospital. A lot of folly is practised by unrealis-
tic Christians who live by logic more than by revelation.
There was a law for the cleansing of lepers, that we saw in Leviticus 
13, 14. Those Israelites could not dictate to God and say, “Lord, You 
said  that  You  are  our  Healer.  Now,  Lord,  heal  this  leper.  We  are  not 
going to put him outside the camp.” But the Lord said, “Put him outside 
the camp.” It is better to humble ourselves and acknowledge that there 
are many cases where the Lord does not heal, for some good reason 
known to Him alone. Jesus Himself said, “There were many lepers in 
Israel in the time of Elisha, but none of them were healed” (Luke 4:27) 
– in spite of God saying “I the Lord am your Healer”!
The Bible is realistic. But those who major on one favourite verse here, 
or one favourite verse there, go astray. We must devote ourselves to the 
study  of  God’s  Word  if  we  are  to  avoid  going  astray  and  avoid  leading  
others astray. It grieves my heart when I see poor people suffering through 
being led astray by their leaders who do not know God or His Word.
 In Numbers 5:6–8, it says that when a man has sinned against another 
in a matter that requires him to make restitution to the wronged man, 
“he shall make restitution in full for his wrong and add to it one-fifth of 
it and give it to him whom he has wronged.” This is righteousness – to 
make  up  for  the  interest  that  the  other  man  lost  on  his  money  during  
the period. If the restitution is made after many years, obviously a higher 
percentage  than  20%  should  be  added.  That  was  why  Zaccheus  (who  
was a shrewd accountant) knew that he had to return four times what 
he  had  taken  wrongly  from  others.  He  did  a  quick  mental  calculation  
and  knew  that  if  20%  had  to  be  added  for  a  debt  that  was  one  year  
old, then over 300% would have to be added for eight-year-old debts (at 
compound interest)! And the Lord did not stop Zaccheus from repaying 
that, because He also knew that that was righteous.
Soon after I was baptised (in 1961), one of the first things the Lord 
spoke to me about was to make restitution to the government for cheat-
ing it of taxes in the past. As I calculated the amount, I was uncertain 
about the exact amount I owed – and was considering two figures in my 
mind – one 20% more than the other. I finally decided to pay the lower 
figure. You know how, in such matters, we always make a decision in our 
own favour always!! I had never read this verse in Numbers at that time. 

Various Laws                                                                                                                                                99
Numbers
As I was thinking of giving the lesser amount, I came across this verse in 
my Bible reading. The Lord gave me a direct answer to my question: “Add 
20% and give it back”!! If you are in doubt, it is always better to give more, 
as  restitution,  rather  than  less.  It  will  be  well  worth  it,  to  have  a  clear  
conscience in the day that we stand before the Lord. I didn’t want to have 
that extra 20% in my bank account, and not be ready to meet the Lord!
Chapter 5:11–31: Here we read of how God exposes sin in an unfaithful 
wife. If a man’s wife had committed adultery, God would expose her by 
making her belly swell and her thigh rot, when the priest made her drink 
water that contained some dust from the floor of the tabernacle. Then, 
what that woman did in secret would be revealed. In Acts 5, we read that 
what Ananias and Sapphira did in secret was revealed by God. The differ-
ence was that under the new covenant, sin was exposed by God not by 
“holy water” but by the Holy Spirit. Peter exposed Ananias and Sapphira 
supernaturally through the discernment of the Spirit. It is very impor-
tant for Christian leaders to have spiritual discernment so that they can 
see the true spiritual condition of people.
Numbers  6:1–21  deals  with  the  Nazirite  vow.  (Note  that  this  is  not  
‘Nazarite’. It has nothing to do with Nazareth. Jesus was called a Nazarene 
– not a Nazirite – because He lived in Nazareth – Matthew 2:23). 
A Nazirite was one who took a voluntary vow to be dedicated exclusively 
to the Lord for a period of time. During this period, he was not permitted 
to cut his hair or drink grape-juice or wine. Samson was such a Nazirite 
for life. So we see here, that there were two ways in which Samson could 
have  lost  his  strength  –  by  allowing  his  hair  to  be  cut,  or  by  drinking  
grape-juice or wine. His strength was not in his hair but in his dedication 
– which was shown by not cutting his hair and not drinking wine. Either 
of the two would have made him lose his strength. But Jesus did cut his 
hair and did drink wine, because He was not a Nazirite.
In Chapter  6:22–27,  we  see  the  blessing  with  which  Aaron  was  
commanded to bless the people of Israel. This was the greatest blessing 
that God could give those under the old covenant – and it was not just 
health and wealth. It was far more. The Lord did not tell Aaron to bless 
them  saying,  “May  the  Lord  bless  you  with  plenty  of  money  and  good  
health.” No. The blessing was:
“The Lord bless you and keep you” – May He preserve you from all evil. 
“The Lord make His face shine on you” – May His glory shine upon you.
“The Lord be gracious to you” – May He be merciful to you and forgive 
you all your sins.
“The Lord lift up His countenance on you” – May He show you His favour.
“The Lord give you peace” – May you have a peaceful heart, a peaceful 
life and a peaceful home.
There was nothing greater that they could get than this.

Wanderings and Murmurings
In Chapter  9:15–23,  we  read  how  the  Lord  led  His  people  by  the  pillar  
of cloud and fire. The cloud provided a shade from the sun in that hot 
desert and the fire showed them the way at night. Whenever the cloud 
lifted,  the  people  of  Israel  would  set  out,  and  when  the  cloud  stopped,  
they camped. Sometimes the cloud would linger for a few days and some-
times it lingered for many months (verses 19, 22). If the cloud stopped 
only for one night, then when the cloud lifted in the morning, they would 
move  on  (verse  21). They  would  settle  down  in  the  evening  and  in  the  
morning they would have to move. Think of the practical inconvenience 
of this! Here were people travelling with their little children, their tents 
and their animals – and they had to set up their tents, when the cloud 
stopped late in the evening. It would have taken them a few hours to set 
up their tents before they could go to bed that night. At dawn the next 
morning, they would hear the cry going through the camp that the cloud 
was  lifting  again.  I  can  imagine  the  irritation  that  swept  through  the  
camp – because they would have to pack up everything and move again. 
Thus  God  taught  them  to  learn  patience  and  to  obey  Him  moment  by  
moment!
A  true  servant  of  God  will  never  complain  when  God  tells  him  to  do  
what is inconvenient. God may tell him to go somewhere and then tell 
him to return. He obeys instantaneously, like the angels of heaven.
The pillar here is a picture of the Holy Spirit. You can be born of the 
Spirit  and  baptised  in  the  Spirit,  and  yet  not  be  led  by  the  Spirit  in  
your daily life. Only those who are “led by the Spirit” are the sons of 
God (Romans 8:14).
There is a difference between a child and a son. A son is mature and 
grown up. Those who are led by the Spirit in daily life are the sons. 
God  was  very  strict  about  any  murmuring  or  complaining  that  He  
heard in the camp of the Israelites. The Israelites who grumbled in the 
wilderness “were destroyed by the destroyer” (1 Corinthians 10:10). And 
we are told in the next verse that this is written as a warning for us not 
to grumble and complain (1 Corinthians 10:11). We shine as lights in a 
world full of murmuring and complaining, mainly by living a life in which 
we “do all things without murmuring and complaining” (Philippians 2:14). 
Murmuring  and  complaining  were  characteristic  of  the  Israelites  
during their 40 years of wandering in the wilderness and are the clear-
est proof that such a person has not yet entered the land of Canaan (the 
victorious life). A Christian leader who grumbles and murmurs can never 
lead others into the victorious life. One of the clearest proofs that we have 
finished with “wilderness wanderings” is that we have stopped grumbling 
and complaining in our homes and elsewhere, and started giving thanks 
at all times and for everything (1 Thessalonians 5:18; Ephesians 5:20).

Rebellion Against God                                                                                                                              101

In Chapter  12  we  read  about  the  grumbling  and  murmuring  of  the  
leaders:  Miriam  and  Aaron  criticised  Moses  concerning  the  woman  he  
had married. In actual fact, this was because they were jealous of Moses’ 
ministry. Aaron was 3 years older than Moses and Miriam was 12 years 
older, and they saw God using their younger brother as Israel’s prophet 
and leader. It’s not easy to submit to someone who is younger than you. 
God chose Moses because he was the humblest man on earth (verse 3). 
That verse is found in parenthesis (brackets) because Moses did not write 
that  about  himself.  It  was  added  later  –  probably  by  Joshua.  The  only  
thing they could find to criticise in Moses was that he had married a 
non-Jew. It says there that “the Lord heard it” (verse 2). The Lord hears it 
whenever anyone speaks against His anointed servants. The Lord called 
them out and told them that whereas He spoke to prophets by visions 
and  dreams,  he  spoke  to  Moses  face  to  face,  as  a  man  speaks  to  his  
friend (verses 6–8; Exodus 33:11).
Here the Lord makes it clear that His speaking to us face to face is far 
superior to His speaking to us in a vision or a dream. Yet many believers 
today imagine that a man who claims to have visions and dreams is more 
spiritual than one who hears the Lord speaking to his heart. To be led by 
the Spirit in day to day matters is far superior to mere visions and dreams. 
The Lord was angry with Miriam and Aaron for criticising His servant. 
The  cloud  withdrew  from  the  tent  and  Miriam  suddenly  became  full  of  
leprosy  (verse  10).  And  Moses  whom  she  criticised  had  to  pray  for  her  
healing. The  Bible  says,  “Pray  for  those  who  persecute  you”  (Matthew 
5:44).  That  is  a  new  covenant  command  and  not  an  old  covenant  one.  
But Moses was a new covenant man living in old covenant times. He was 
an amazing man. Just like there are Christians in this new covenant age 
who live by old covenant standards, even so there were a few under the 
old covenant, who lived by new covenant principles. When the Bible says 
that all who come under grace (the new covenant) will overcome sin in 
their  lives  (Romans  6:14),  that  means  that  those  who  do  not  overcome  
sin are living under the old covenant – and most believers are defeated 
by sin in their lives. 
The Lord said that Miriam must be put out of the camp for seven days 
so that she learns a lesson (verse 15). Otherwise others would not know 
what  happened  and  would  not  fear  to  do  such  things  themselves.  God  
makes  an  example  of  those  who  rebel  so  that  others  may  fear.  Miriam  
learned her lesson and then came back to the camp – never to speak like 
that again in her life. But in spite of this, many others in the camp did 
not learn a lesson – and we shall come to that later.
Rebellion Against God
In Chapter 13, we find that the Israelites came to Kadesh-barnea at the 
border  of  Canaan  –  the  land  that  God  had  promised  them.  It  was  now  

102 Through the Bible: Israel’s Wilderness Wanderings and Warfare
Numbers
two  years  since  they  left  Egypt  (Deuteronomy  2:14)  and  God  told  them  
to go in and possess the land. The Israelites sent twelve spies to survey 
the land. All twelve of them came back saying that the land was indeed 
a wonderful land. Ten of them however said, “But there are huge giants 
there and we cannot conquer them.” But two of them – Caleb and Joshua 
– replied saying, “The Lord will help us to conquer those big giants”. But 
the 600,000 Israelites listened to the majority.
What do we learn from this? First of all, that it is dangerous to follow 
the majority – because the majority is invariably wrong. “The way to 
life is narrow and very few find it,” Jesus said. The majority still go on 
the  broad  way  to  destruction.  So  if  you  follow  the  majority,  you  will  
certainly  be  along  with  them  on  the  broad  way  to  destruction.  Don’t  
ever imagine that a large church is a spiritual church. Jesus’ church 
had only 11 members in it.
When ten leaders say one thing and two say the exact opposite, whose 
side  will  you  take?  God  was  on  the  side  of  the  two  here  –  Joshua  and  
Caleb.  Unbelief  and  Satan  were  on  the  side  of  the  other  ten.  But  the  
Israelites  foolishly  followed  the  majority  –  and  that  was  why  they  had  
to  wander  in  the  wilderness  for  the  next  38  years.  They  did  not  have  
the discernment to see whose side God was on! God plus one person is 
always a majority against any number of people – and so I want to stand 
with God always. We saw in Exodus 32 that God was on the side of just 
one man Moses, when all the Israelites were worshipping the golden calf. 
But of all the twelve tribes, only the tribe of Levi could see that then. And 
now when God was with Joshua and Caleb, even the tribe of Levi could 
not recognise it!
All of this has lessons for us today. Christendom in general is full of 
compromise and worldliness. Here and there, God raises up a few who 
stand for the truth of God’s word without any compromise. If you have 
discernment, you will recognise that God is with those few, and you will 
stand with them against the majority. And you will enter the promised 
land with them.
How do you identify the man with whom God is standing? He speaks 
the language of faith. Joshua and Caleb spoke the language of faith: “We 
can overcome”. “We can overcome the giants of anger, sexual lust, jeal-
ousy, murmuring and the love of money. We can overcome Satan. God 
will crush Satan under our feet” – that is the language of the man with 
whom God stands. The man who is not with God says: “We must not take 
the Bible so literally. After all, we are only human. We will be defeated 
until the end of our lives. You have to understand human psychology.” 
Quite honestly, I don’t care for “human psychology”. I believe God’s Word.
Many  Christians  go  astray  exactly  like  those  Israelites  –  through  
human reasoning. God has hidden these truths from the clever and the 

Rebellion Against God                                                                                                                              103

intelligent and revealed them to babes. If you use your human reason-
ing  and  your  cleverness  to  study  the  Bible,  I  can  guarantee  that  you  
will go astray. What you need is the revelation of the Holy Spirit. That’s 
why Jesus picked fishermen to be His disciples, and not professors like 
Gamaliel and his students. He did pick one of Gamaliel’s students later 
– Paul. But the Lord had to take Paul into the desert for three years to 
bring down all his pride to nothing before he could get revelation. 
God  was  so  angry  with  those  Israelites  who  doubted  His  power  that  
He told them “Surely all these people before whom I performed all these 
signs  will  never  enter  the  promised  land.  They  will  all  perish,  these  
people who have put Me to the test ten times” (Numbers 14:22). “Ten 
times” was not an exaggeration. They had actually rebelled ten times. 
Here is a list of their ten rebellions:
1. When the Egyptians chased after them at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:11).
2. When the waters were bitter at Marah (Exodus 15:24).
3. When they didn’t have bread in the wilderness of Sin (Exodus 16:2, 3).
4. When they kept the manna overnight (Exodus 16:20).
5. When they went out on the sabbath day looking for manna (Exodus 
16:27, 28).
6. When there was no water to drink at Rephidim (Exodus 17:3).
7. When they worshipped the golden calf (Exodus 32).
8. When they complained at Taberah (Numbers 11:1).
9. When they asked for meat (Numbers 11:4, 33).
10. When they refused to go into Canaan (Numbers 13).
God gave them nine chances. They took advantage of His forgiveness – 
just like many believers do today – not realising that the ninth chance 
was their last. God’s patience had run out and they were punished when 
they  rebelled  the  tenth  time.  There  was  no  way  to  go  back  then.  They  
repented  when  they  heard  their  punishment  and  asked  for  one  more  
chance. But it was too late (Numbers 14:39–45). Many believers will find 
one day that the opportunities to enter a life of victory are also not avail-
able forever.
In Chapter 16, we read of the rebellion of Korah and his fellow-rebels. 
One  would  have  thought  that  Korah,  Dathan  and  Abiram  would  have  
learned a lesson when Miriam was put outside the camp for seven days 
for her rebellion against Moses. A wise man learns from the mistakes of 
others.  But  a  foolish  person  makes  the  same  mistake  himself.  Most  of  
the other Israelites had learnt a lesson from Miriam’s example, but not 
Korah, Dathan and Abiram. God punished Korah, Dathan and Abiram 
by sending them alive to hell.
We read of two people who went to heaven alive – Enoch and Elijah. 
Here we read of the only people who went alive into hell.

104 Through the Bible: Israel’s Wilderness Wanderings and Warfare
Numbers
Initially  there  were  four  men  who  rebelled  against  Moses  –  Korah,  
Dathan, Abiram and On (Numbers 16:1). Moses told them to come back 
the next morning (verse 5). Overnight, one of these four men – On – came 
to  his  senses,  repented  and  backed  out.  Thus  he  saved  his  family  as  
well  from  destruction.  Moses  called  Dathan  and  Abiram  to  warn  them  
privately, but they refused to meet him (verse 12). Their pride and arro-
gance  in  refusing  to  meet  Moses  sealed  their  fate  and  the  fate  of  their  
families.  The  next  morning  these  three  men  came  to  Moses  with  no  
change in their rebellious attitudes (verse 24).
The  Lord  then  told  the  people  to  pull  back  from  the  tents  of  Korah,  
Dathan and Abiram – and the people did. But now something interesting 
happened – that is not recorded here in Chapter16, but only in Chapter 
26:11. There we read that the sons of Korah did not die. They must have 
been  grown  sons.  They  had  stood  outside  their  tent,  with  their  father  
initially, in his rebellion against Moses. But when the Lord told the people 
to pull back from the tents of the rebels, these sons of Korah obeyed. They 
told their father, “Dad, we are not standing with you. We’re going to stand 
with  Moses”  –  and  they  ran  to  Moses’  side.  Sometimes  children  have  
more sense than their parents! Thus they escaped hell. But the Israelites 
blamed Moses for the death of these rebels and so another 14,700 people 
joined  the  rebels  in  hell  that  day  (16:41–49). To  rebel  against  a  godly  
man is a very serious thing in God’s eyes. It is not the same as rebelling 
against dead religious leaders – which may at times be necessary!
The descendants of those sons of Korah (who escaped death), were the 
song leaders of God’s people in David’s time. They are the ones who wrote 
Psalms 42 to 49 and Psalm 84 etc. Psalm 46:2, 3 speaks about the earth 
opening  up  and  the  mountains  slipping  inside,  and  about  God  being  
their refuge at such a time. Undoubtedly they were thinking of the last- 
minute escape of their fathers, because of which they themselves were 
alive to praise God in their day and age. Then in Psalm 84:10, they wrote, 
“I  would  rather  be  a  doorkeeper  in  the  house  of  God  than  dwell  in  the 
tents of wickedness” – (the tents of their father Korah! That’s what they 
meant there). These psalms of the sons of Korah become more meaning-
ful to us when we understand this background of the writers.
God now wanted to prove to the Israelites once and for all that it was 
He himself Who had appointed Aaron to be the high priest – for it was the 
priestly ministry that Korah and company had questioned and coveted. 
God told Moses to tell the 12 leaders of the tribes to bring a rod each. 
(Numbers 17). They were to break off a branch from a tree and to bring 
it with them. Aaron also had to bring one, representing the tribe of Levi. 
God told them to put all the rods in the tent, and in the morning the one 
He approved of would bear fruit. In the morning they saw that Aaron’s 
rod  budded  and  produced  fruit  on  the  dead  broken  branch  (verse  8). 
Thus  the  Lord  put  an  end  to  the  dispute  about  whom  He  had  chosen.  
This is how the Lord identifies the servant whom He has chosen – by 

Moses Punished                                                                                                                                        105
Numbers
the  principle  of  resurrection  –  life  coming  out  of  a  dead  branch.  What  
that means for us is that in the midst of spiritual death, God preserves 
His servants alive. They are not swallowed up by the spiritual death of 
Christendom around them. Like Aaron’s rod, they bring forth fruit in the 
midst of death. Their anointing is always fresh like fresh fruit. Constant 
freshness  in  the  ministry  is  so  rare  to  see  in  anyone  these  days  –  and  
yet  that  is  the  mark  of  the  man  God  anoints.  Aaron’s  rod  stayed  fresh  
throughout the wilderness journey. 
We find a lovely verse in Chapter  18:20,  where  the  Lord  tells  Aaron,  
“You shall have no inheritance in the promised land when you go there. 
I  am your portion and your inheritance.” This is what the Lord says to 
us too. There is nothing wrong in owning a house or land. But if you 
ever get attached to any of it, you can never be a servant of the Lord. 
If you want to serve the Lord, your attitude to everything on this earth 
must be, “I may have these things here – a house or a car or a scooter 
or  whatever.  But  I  am  not  attached  to  any  of  these  things.  The  Lord  
is my portion and my inheritance. The other things the Lord can take 
away any time He wants.”
Moses Punished
In Chapter  20,  we  read  of  Moses  being  punished  for  one  single  act  of  
disobedience.  This  was  the  only  time  Moses  slipped  up  and  disobeyed  
God. He who had faithfully obeyed God in everything made one mistake 
towards  the  end  of  his  life  –  and  paid  for  it  by  being  denied  entry  into  
Canaan. This was the second time that the people cried for water. This 
time God told Moses not to smite the rock, but only to speak to it (verse 8). 
This was because the rock (Exodus 17) symbolised Christ Who had to be 
smitten only once on the cross. After that, we just speak to it to get the 
benefit  of  that  once-for-all  smiting.  But  Moses  was  angry  and  struck  
the rock twice. The Lord immediately told Moses that he could not enter 
Canaan (20:12).
God  gave  the  Israelites  nine  chances  and  denied  them  entry  into  
Canaan only when they rebelled the tenth time. But Moses was not given 
even one chance. The very first time he failed, he was denied entry into 
Canaan.  Why?  Because  God  expects  more  from  leaders  than  from  ordi-
nary believers. This is true even today. To whom more is given, more is 
required.
Moses pleaded with God. For 40 years he had longed to enter the land 
of Canaan. And now at the very borders of the land he was denied entry. 
But God would not relent. Whenever Moses prayed for mercy for others, 
God always relented. But not when Moses prayed for himself. So Moses 
humbled  himself  and  accepted  the  punishment.  But  God  was  good  to  
him. 1500 years later, God allowed him to enter the promised land, when 

106 Through the Bible: Israel’s Wilderness Wanderings and Warfare
Numbers
he stood with our Lord on the mount of transfiguration! That was the first 
time that Moses stood in the promised land. God honoured His servant 
by giving him a much better entry into Canaan than if he had entered 
with the rebellious Israelites. If Moses had trusted God, he would have 
realised that God, even then, had planned something good for him. God 
is always “silently planning for us in love” (Zephaniah 3:17 - paraphrase). 
But at that time, God had to punish Moses publicly so that people would 
know that God is strict about disobedience in His servants.
But did the water flow when Moses disobeyed? Yes, it did. Even when a 
man disobeys God, the blessings may still flow from his ministry. What 
does that prove? That doesn’t prove that God is happy with the man. 
No. It only proves that God loves the people so much that He blesses 
them, despite  the  disobedience  of  His  servants.  It  was  because  God  
loved the Israelites, that He allowed the water to flow that day. When 
you see blessing flowing from the ministry of a carnal servant of God 
today,  remember  that  that  only  proves  that  God  loves  the  people.  It  
doesn’t prove that God approves of His servant. Even as God dealt with 
Moses later, He will deal with that servant later. Jesus said that many 
people would come to Him in the last day and say, “Lord, we cast out 
demons in Your name, we prophesied in Your name, we healed the sick 
in  Your  name.”  All  of  that  was  true.  People  were  healed  and  blessed  
and delivered. But the Lord will still say to those preachers, “Depart 
from Me, because You did not live a holy life. You lived in sin.” So we 
see clearly that God uses even carnal, disobedient preachers, because 
He loves the people.
In Chapter 21, we read of a time when God punished the Israelites by 
sending poisonous snakes into their midst. When the people cried out, 
God told Moses to make a bronze figure of a serpent and to put it on a 
pole. Then anyone who was bitten could look at this bronze serpent and 
be  healed.  Jesus  told  Nicodemus  that  this  was  a  picture  of  the  cross  
where He would be lifted up to die (John 3:14). We have all been bitten 
by the old serpent Satan and his poison is flowing in our system and 
killing us spiritually. But we can be healed completely if we look by faith 
at  Jesus  hanging  on  the  cross  not  only  for  our  forgiveness  but  also  to  
deliver us from the evil effects of this poison flowing in our system. We 
can be set free permanently.
Balaam – A Warning
In Chapters 22–24, we read the story of Balaam. There is an important 
passage here concerning a number of matters. When King Balak invited 
Balaam the prophet to come and curse Israel, Balaam sought the will of 
God. And God clearly told Balaam not to go. But then King Balak said he 

Balaam – A Warning                                                                                                                                 107
Numbers
would give him more honour and more money if he came. Then Balaam 
said  he  would  seek  God’s  will  again.  What  was  the  need  to  seek  God’s  
will  a  second  time,  when  God  Who  knows  the  end  from  the  beginning  
had already told him not to go? But he was eager to get the money and 
honour. The Bible says that Balaam “loved the wages of unrighteousness” 
(2 Peter 2:15).
You may find yourself in situations like that, where you seek God and 
sense very clearly in your spirit that God does not want you to go some-
where. Then you find the salary there to be very attractive and you are 
tempted “to seek God’s will again”!! Whenever you face such a tempta-
tion in the future, remember Balaam. God doesn’t change his mind, just 
because the salary is more attractive, or the honour is greater. But where 
God sees that a man wants to go a certain way, God won’t stop him. He 
will let him go. This is why God told Balaam to go when Balaam asked 
him the second time. That was not God’s perfect will. He would not over-
ride Balaam’s free will and make him into a robot. He saw that Balaam 
really wanted to go. So God said “Go”. This was something like the father 
of  the  prodigal  son  allowing  his  son  to  go  to  the  far  country.  God  has  
given us freedom of choice and He will never override our free will.
But God still sent His angel to stop Balaam. Balaam himself could not 
see the angel, but his donkey could. What lesson do we learn from this? 
Just  this:  When  a  man  is  blinded  by  the  love  of  money,  even  a  donkey  
will be able to see spiritual realities more clearly than him! Because that 
donkey did not love money, it could see the angel clearly! Balaam could 
not,  because  he  loved  money.  Balaam  experienced  the  Spirit  of  God  
coming  upon  him;  and  he  prophesied  about  Christ’s  coming  (Numbers 
24:2, 17). But he lost everything, because of his love for money.
That donkey began to speak to its master. This is the first instance 
of  “speaking  in  tongues”  in  the  Bible  –  a  donkey  speaking  a  foreign  
language fluently – a language it had never learnt! It was supernatural. 
It was from God, undoubtedly. But let us learn from this first instance 
of speaking in tongues in Scripture that speaking in tongues does not 
make  anyone  spiritual  –  for  that  donkey  remained  a  stupid  donkey  
even after it spoke in tongues, and even after it experienced the super-
natural power of God through its tongue! Remember that always.
Then Balaam suggested a clever tactic to the people of Moab. He told 
them  that  the  best  way  to  destroy  the  Israelites  was  by  making  their  
God Himself to turn against them. And the best way to make God turn 
against His people was by making them immoral. So he asked them to 
send  their  pretty  daughters  into  the  Israeli  camp  to  seduce  the  Israeli  
men. Thus Israel fell not only into immorality but also into the worship 
of the idols that these Moabite girls brought into the Israeli camp (See 
Numbers 25:1 with Revelation 2:14). And sure enough God punished the 

108 Through the Bible: Israel’s Wilderness Wanderings and Warfare
Numbers
Israelites severely. 24,000 people died of a plague (Numbers 25:9). This 
is the way that Satan has polluted believers today as well. Let us learn 
Satan’s schemes from Balaam and be alert.
As the plague began to spread through the camp of Israel and the people 
were dying like flies, the whole nation would have been wiped out there 
by Balaam’s tactic if it had not been for the zeal of one man, Phinehas, 
Aaron’s  grandson  (See  Numbers  25:9  onwards).  Phinehas  took  a  spear  
and went into one of the tents and killed a man and the Midianite woman 
he had brought into the tent. That stopped the plague. And because of 
his zeal for God’s name and honour, God made a covenant with Phinehas 
that  his  descendants  would  be  priests  in  Israel  forever.  God  honours  
those who stand boldly for Him – even if they have to take hard decisions 
against others and become unpopular thereby.
In Chapter 26 we read of the second census. We see here the persis-
tence of God in bringing them back to Kadesh-barnea and giving them 
a second chance to enter the promised land. He is the God of the second 
chance.  This  is  a  great  encouragement  for  those  who  have  failed.  In  
fact,  He  is  the  God  of  the  millionth  chance!!  He  forgives  us  again  and  
again and gives us any number of chances to enter the life of victory.
In 27:15–23 we see Moses asking the Lord to appoint someone of His 
choice to succeed him as Israel’s leader, to lead them into Canaan. Moses 
had two sons. But he did not hand over the leadership of God’s people 
to  them  –  as  many  Christian  leaders  do  today.  He  was  a  man  of  God.  
And  he  was  not  interested  in  starting  a  royal  dynasty  of  his  own!!  He  
sought God’s will and God told him to appoint Joshua (“a man in whom 
is the Spirit” – verse 18) as the next leader of Israel. And Moses did that 
immediately.
In Chapters  28  and  29  are  some  more  laws  about  offerings.  Then  in  
Chapter 30 is a law concerning vows. We read something interesting here 
– that a father can cancel a vow that his daughter makes foolishly and a 
husband can cancel a foolish vow that his wife makes. But if the father 
and husband hear the vow and say nothing then the vow stands. This 
shows how important it is for us to exercise our authority as fathers over 
our children that they do not go in foolish ways and as husbands to be 
the head in our homes, so that our wives do not lead our homes astray 
by some foolishness.
In Chapter 32, we read of the compromise of the tribes of Reuben and 
Gad. Because they were enormously wealthy in cattle, they were on the 
constant  look  out  for  good  pasture  land  for  their  herds.  So  when  they  
saw some good land in Gilead – on the eastern side of Jordan (not within 
Canaan),  they  asked  Moses  for  permission  to  settle  down  there.  They  
rejected the call of God to enter the promised land. Even after 40 years of 
wanderings, they had not learnt a lesson. What does God do with such 

Balaam – A Warning                                                                                                                                 109
Numbers
people who are more interested in their business and wealth than in a life 
of victory? He lets them go their way. So Moses permitted them to settle 
there.  They  are  a  picture  of  many  believers  who  have  chosen  worldly  
affluence above spiritual values. 
Moses’  words  to  them  are  a  stinging  rebuke  to  many  comfort-loving  
believers today: “Shall your brothers go to war, while you yourselves sit 
here?” (Numbers 32:6).
They finally agreed to help the other tribes possess Canaan; but said 
that after that they would prefer to come back to settle in this prosperous 
land east of Jordan.
In Numbers 35, we read of God appointing six “cities of refuge” where 
people  who  killed  others  accidentally could flee to escape the wrath of 
the relatives of the dead man. Accidentally killing man is not in the same 
category  as  murder  –  and  God  made  provision  for  such  people  to  be  
protected, while not sparing murderers. In all the laws that God gave, we 
see  Him  unsparing  against  deliberate  sin,  but  always  providing  merci-
fully  for  unintentional  sin.  We  saw  that  in  our  study  of  Leviticus  and  
now here too. It is amazing indeed then that such a holy God should so 
mercifully forgive us who have sinned deliberately so often. Praise God 
for His grace and mercy toward us.



DEUTERONOMY
Repetition of the Law and  
Review of God’s Dealings
‘D
euteronomy’ means ‘a second law.’ This is because there is a repe-
tition here of many important aspects of the law. 
We can divide this book in two ways. 
We can divide it first of all, as three speeches that Moses gave:
1. First speech (Chapters 1 to 4).
2. Second speech (Chapters 5 to 26).
3. Third speech (Chapters 27 to 30). 
And all of this was spoken by the man who told the Lord at the burning 
bush that he could not speak!
The book concludes with the song of Moses (Chapter 32), the blessing 
of Moses (Chapter 33) and the death of Moses (Chapter 34). 
The  second  way  to  divide  the  book  is  to  see  it  as  looking  in  three  
directions:
1. Looking backward. Two messages looking back at God’s faithfulness 
during the 40 years in the wilderness (Chapters 1–11).
2. Looking  upward.  Two  messages  looking  up  at  God  –  through  His  
laws. Through God’s laws, man sees his need (Chapters 12–31). 
3. Looking forward. Two messages that look forward to the wonderful 
things that God would do in the future (Chapters 32–33).
All of us need these three looks in our life. We should never stop having 
these three looks, no matter how old we become. 

112 Through the Bible: Repetition of the Law and Review of God’s Dealings 
Deuteronomy
Looking Backward
We need to look back. Many times in my life I have looked back over how 
the  Lord  has  led  me  –  and  that  has  renewed  my  faith.  When  I  face  a  
difficult situation and it looks as if there is no way out, I remind myself 
of the promises in the Bible and listen to the encouragement that other 
believers give me. But the thing that strengthens my faith most of all is 
when I look back. The Lord asks me, “Have I ever let you down even once 
so far?” I have to reply, “No, Lord. Not even once.” Then He says, “I won’t 
let you down now either.” The backward look encourages me more than 
anything else.
Have you fallen again? Look back and see how the Lord forgave you in 
the past. When He forgave you, didn’t He know that you would fall again? 
Was that a surprise to Him that you fell again? No. Then He will forgive 
you again. Look back with gratitude. That will strengthen your faith. Be 
thankful for the Lord’s mercy. When you look at your failures in the past, 
you will learn to be merciful to other believers around you who fail.
But there is another way in which we must not look back. Paul said, 
“Forgetting the things that are behind.” (Philippians 3:13). If we look back 
in a wrong way, we will get discouraged and think that we are useless 
and a failure in life, having wasted so many years of our life. 
Let me give a word of encouragement to those who feel they have wasted 
their  lives.  Jesus  told  a  parable  of  some  labourers  who  did  not  work  
for 11 hours out of 12 in a working day. At the 11
th
 hour a man called 
them and asked them to work in his vineyard. They went and worked for 
just one hour. But Jesus said that they got their wages first! Those who 
worked for 12 hours got their reward last! I hope that encourages you. 
We  should  not  look  back  in  discouragement.  Neither  should  we  look  
back  in  pride. “Forgetting  the  things  that  lie  behind”  relates  to  both  the  
things that discourage us as well as to the things that make us proud. 
If   you can think of anything that discourages you or makes you proud, 
I would ask you to forget it as soon as possible. But we need to look back 
with gratitude to God always, for what He has done for us in the past. 
That’s the backward look I am talking about. Peter says that those who 
don’t look back like that, but forget their purification from their sins will 
be blind and short-sighted (2 Peter 1:9).
Looking Upward
We  also  need  to  look  up.  We  must  never  stop  looking  upwards  and  
seeing more of the glory of the Lord. There is much of the glory of Jesus 
that we still haven’t seen. We must hunger for this, because that’s the 
image into which the Holy Spirit seeks to transform us. As we see the 
Lord’s glory, it will humble us because we will see our own need. This 
is the secret of remaining in humility till the end of our lives.

Looking Forward                                                                                                                                       113
Deuteronomy
It is very easy for one whom God has anointed and used mightily to 
become  proud.  I  have  seen  a  lot  of  preachers  like  that.  Because  God  
has used them they are so proud and they are very distant from people. 
What is it that can keep us in brokenness and humility till the end of 
our lives? Only one thing. Looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher 
of our faith. When we look at Jesus it is impossible to be proud. A man 
becomes  proud  when  he  starts  looking  at  other  people,  and  imagines  
himself  to  be  better  than  them,  or  more  anointed  than  them,  or  more  
used than them etc. If, however, he looked upwards at Jesus, he would 
fall on his face in the dust in repentance – like the apostle John did on 
the Isle of Patmos. And if he keeps looking at Jesus, he will keep his face 
in the dust forever. 
All of us need to learn to keep our faces in the dust at all times. That’s 
the place of safety. So if you want God to be happy with you until the end 
of your days, keep looking upwards. 
We should never look inwards first. We must always look upwards first. 
We must look at Jesus and as we see His glory, we will see our sin. That’s 
the best way to see our sin; otherwise we will be discouraged.
Looking Forward
We need to look forward too – in faith. God has wonderful things in store 
for us. He has a great job for us to do. We don’t know when we will have 
to leave this world. But before the Lord comes, we look forward to doing 
something useful for Him on this earth. Most people in the world look to 
the future with fear and anxiety. But we look forward in faith.
God  told  Moses  in  Deuteronomy to  tell  the  Israelites  to  look  forward  
to the time when they would live in Canaan. He prophesied concerning 
Israel’s far-distant future in Deuteronomy.
Repetition
There  is  one  other  thing  that  we  see  in  Deuteronomy –  a  repetition  of  
many  matters  that  were  already  written  in  the  earlier  books  of  Moses.  
We should not be disturbed by repetition. Repetition is necessary for us 
to be gripped by the truth. That is why God has repeated many things in 
His Word. The history of the kings of Judah are mentioned twice – first 
in the two books of Kings and again in the two books of Chronicles. Why 
does  the  New  Testament  open  with  four biographies  of  Christ  and  not  
just one? There is a lot of repetition in the four gospels. Some matters 
are mentioned four times – in the four gospels. There must be a very good 
reason for that. Many things are repeated in the letter to the Colossians 
which  were  already  mentioned  in  Ephesians.  What  we  can  learn  from  
this is that the apostles were not ashamed to repeat themselves. Some 
preachers  are  afraid  to  repeat  a  sermon  on  the  same  subject  lest  they  

114 Through the Bible: Repetition of the Law and Review of God’s Dealings 
Deuteronomy
lose their reputation before the people. They are more concerned about 
what people think about them than about those people’s need.
I heard of an evangelist who conducted seven days meetings in a town 
and  preached  every  day  on  the  subject:  “You  must  be  born  again.”  An  
unconverted man who attended all the meetings got tired of hearing the 
same theme on all seven days and asked him why he preached every day 
on, “You must be born again”? The evangelist replied, “Because you must 
be born again.” That’s the answer. The message had to be repeated until 
the man was born again. He does not need to hear something else. The 
patient has to take the same antibiotic until he is cured!
Now if you were to ask me why I keep on saying, “You must get victory 
over sin”, I hope you know the answer: “Because you must get victory over 
sin.” 
The  Old  Testament  prophets  repeated  the  same  message  again  and  
again  because  Israel  needed  to  hear  what  God  was  saying  clearly. 
Jeremiah preached virtually the same message for more than 40 years, 
until he almost got tired of preaching it. But many a time, people need to 
hear something ten times before the truth sinks in. So we should never 
be  ashamed  of  preaching  on  the  same  subject  again  and  again  to  the  
same audience. If we are anointed, the message will still be fresh each 
time we preach it.
If we seek the honour of people, we will not repeat. But if we seek their 
good, we will repeat it until they have understood it. This is one of the 
lessons we learn from Deuteronomy – “the second law”.
Deuteronomy begins  with  this  statement  in  Chapter  1:2:  “It  is  eleven  
days’  journey  from  Horeb  by  the  way  of  Mount  Seir  to  Kadesh-barnea.” 
It was only a 11-day journey from Horeb – where the Israelites got the 
laws of God – to Kadesh-barnea (from where they were to enter the land 
of Canaan). But they did not enter. That journey of 11 days finally took 
them 38 years. You can finish 12 grades of school in 12 years or 20 years 
– that depends on you.
What a difference there is between 11 days and 38 years! We can always 
ask God to forgive us if we wasted 38 years outside the will of God for 
our lives – doing what we wanted to do, living for our own pleasure and 
comfort and for making money. At the end of it all, you may say, “Lord, 
please forgive me. I have wasted 38 years of my life”. Will God forgive you? 
He certainly will. But can He give you back the 38 years you wasted? No. 
Even Almighty God cannot give time back to any of us. Can God give us 
last year and its opportunities again? No. He can give us next year. But 
He cannot give us back any of the years gone by. The opportunities we 
had in the past are gone forever. That is why it is important, that if God 
wants to do something in your life in 11 days, you must ensure that it 
doesn’t  take  more  than  11  days.  Chapter  2:14  says  that  the  Israelites  

Qualifications for Leadership                                                                                                                  115
Deuteronomy
reached Kadesh-barnea two years after they had left Egypt. But it took 
them 38 more years before they could go into Canaan, making a total of 
40 years in the desert.
Qualifications for Leadership
In Chapter 1:13, we see Moses giving advice concerning the type of leaders 
he selected for Israel. I want you to see the three qualities he looked for 
– wisdom, discernment and experience.
The first requirement was wisdom.  Wisdom  is  different  from  knowl-
edge. Knowledge comes by study. So those who have clever brains excel 
in this. Wisdom comes by going through many trials. So those who are 
faithful excel in this. Wisdom is the application of knowledge to practical 
situations in life. You may have a lot of Bible knowledge, but no divine 
wisdom.  The  book  of  Proverbs places  a  great  emphasis  on  acquiring  
wisdom – not on knowing Scripture, but on knowing God. The Bible is a 
means by which we get wisdom and know God. A lot of people who study 
the Bible acquire knowledge. But the tree of knowledge brought death. 
Knowledge  puffs  up  (1  Corinthians  8:1).  The  tree  of  life  brings  wisdom  
that teaches us how to live and how to react to different situations in life. 
So wisdom is the first requirement for a leader.
The  second  requirement  was  discernment.  This  is  one  of  the  great-
est needs in leadership today – the ability to discern between what is 
Godly and what is human – not between what is Godly and demonic, 
which is easy, but between that which is of God and that which is of 
man, between that which is spiritual and that which is soulish. 
Sometimes  people  say,  “Well,  after  all  we  are  only  human.”  But  
Paul  rebuked  the  Corinthians  for  “walking  like  mere  human  beings” 
(1 Corinthians 3:3). We shouldn’t be behaving like mere men. We should 
be  walking  like  Jesus  Christ.  “He  who  abides  in  Christ  should  walk  as  
He walked” (1 John 2:6). It may be easy to discern between a spiritual 
man and a carnal man – one who is living in sin. But we must be able to 
discern between a spiritual man and a soulish man – one who lives by 
his human abilities. When you listen to a man speak, you should be able 
to discern whether the man is speaking from his heart or from his head. 
What comes from a man’s head will only go into other people’s heads. But 
what  comes  from  a  man’s  heart  will  go  to  other  people’s  hearts.  Jesus  
always spoke from His heart. We must learn to speak from our hearts. 
The  Bible  was  written  for  our  hearts,  not  for  our  heads.  The  psalmist  
said, “Thy word have I hid in my heart (not my memory) that I may not sin 
against Thee.” (Psalms 119:11).
The third requirement was experience. You may acquire much wisdom 
even when you are young. You may even have discernment. But you still 

116 Through the Bible: Repetition of the Law and Review of God’s Dealings 
Deuteronomy
need experience to be a godly leader – and that takes time. Experience 
comes through being crushed in different trials and tasting God’s power 
and encouragement in those trials (2 Corinthians 1:4). The strength we 
receive through trials is what gives us a ministry to others.
Moses  then  warned  the  judges  not  to  show  partiality  but  to  hear  the  
small and the great alike (verse 17). This is a very important requirement 
for leaders. Never flatter the rich. 
When I was a young believer, I saw in every church I went to, that if a 
man was an influential person in society – such as an important govern-
ment official or a rich businessman – he was always on the board of the 
church. I wondered why this was so. Surely every big man in the world 
was not a spiritual man. In fact, the Bible says that “God has chosen the 
poor  of  the  world  to  be  rich  in  faith”  (James  2:5).  So  these  people  were  
obviously being chosen for their worldly influence. No wonder all those 
churches backslid very soon. They showed the very partiality that we are 
warned against in James 2. I decided then that if the Lord ever planted a 
church through my labours, I would appoint spiritual men as elders, not 
influential men. And this is what we have done in all the churches the 
Lord has planted through us. 
“You shall not fear man,” Moses told the leaders (verse 17). If you want 
to be a leader, you should not be afraid of any man.
A Fresh Repetition of God’s Laws
Chapter  2:2,  3:  “The  Lord  spoke  to  me,  saying  ‘You  have  circled this 
mountain long enough.’ ” The Lord told them that they were “going around 
in circles”. Does the Lord have to say that to any of us? If we are always 
in the same place spiritually, that is what we are doing. Movement is not 
the  same  as  progress!  We  shouldn’t  be  defeated  by  the  same  sins  that  
defeated us 10 years ago. We shouldn’t be losing our temper or lusting 
like we did 10 years ago. If we are, then we are moving around in circles. 
The Lord is now calling us to move on.
Chapter 4:2: “You shall not add to the word that I am commanding you, 
nor take away from it.” Do you know that even the small commandments 
in God’s Word are important? What are the temptations that we face in 
relation to God’s word? Not to ignore the important commandments, but 
the  smaller  ones.  I  have  met  numerous  believers  who  say  that  certain  
commandments  are  minor  and  so  we  can  afford  to  ignore  them.  But  
Jesus said “If anyone cancels the smallest commandments, (he won’t go 
to hell, but) he will be called the least in God’s kingdom. But he who keeps 
the smallest commandments and teaches other people to keep them, will 
be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 5:19).
How  do  we  test  the  obedience  of  our  little  children?  Not  in  the  big  
matters  but  the  small  ones.  Suppose  when  your  5-year-old  son  was  
going to school one day, you said to him, “Now son, on your way to school

Deuteronomy
today,  don’t  murder  anyone,  don’t  commit  adultery  with  anyone,  don’t  
rob  a  bank.”  He  will  come  back  every  day  from  school  and  say,  “Dad,  
I obeyed all your commandments.” But is that where you test his obedi-
ence – in all those major commandments? No. I’ll tell you where you can 
test his obedience. It’s when he is playing outside your house with his 
friends and you say, “All right, son, you have played enough now. Come 
in  now  and  help  Mummy  with  some  work  in  the  house.”  His  reply  will  
invariably be, “Wait, Daddy. Let me just finish this game.” That’s where 
you test his obedience. Now, how do you think God tests your obedience? 
In the small commandments in His Word.
What does it mean, ‘to take away something from the word of God?’ It 
means to ignore the small commandments.
What does it mean to add to God’s Word? There are many Christian 
groups  that  have  rules  for  their  members  that  are  not  in  Scripture.  
Some have rules for full-time Christian workers that they should always 
wear white clothes because that is “more spiritual”! I wish it were that 
easy to become spiritual. But it isn’t. Another such rule is that those 
who serve the Lord should not support themselves. But Paul supported 
himself and he was the greatest servant of all. Are we better than Paul? 
Some teach that to become holy, we must not get married. But all the 
apostles (except Paul and Barnabas) were married (1 Corinthians 9:5). 
Or they teach that we must fast for so many days every year or pray 
for so many hours every day etc. There are multitudes of rules like this 
that preachers have made that only bring believers into condemnation 
and bondage. But none of these rules are in Scripture. These are the 
rules made by today’s Pharisees.
I believe in fasting. But we must not make a law of it. Jesus didn’t. There 
are many things like this which preachers teach – adding to the word of 
God. They try to be more spiritual than God Himself! The result is that 
they  become  carnal  and  legalistic.  When  Satan  came  to  Eve  and  asked  
her what God had told them, Eve replied, adding to and subtracting from 
God’s word. She said, “God has told us not to eat from and not to touch 
this tree, lest we die.” God had never told them anything about touching 
the tree, but only about eating. But Eve tried to be more spiritual than 
God and added “touching” as well. What was the result? She both touched 
and ate! That’s always what happens when people begin to add to God’s 
word. They fall into sin. Eve also subtracted the intensity of what God had 
said by saying, “lest we die” – implying that death was not certain but 
only a possibility! But God had said, “You will surely die.” If we subtract 
or add to God’s word, we thereby nullify it (Genesis 2:16, 17; 3:2, 3).
In Chapter  4, verses  24  and 31,  we  read  two  statements  about  God: 
“God is a consuming fire” and “God is merciful.” God is love, but He is 

118 Through the Bible: Repetition of the Law and Review of God’s Dealings 
Deuteronomy
also a consuming fire. The glory of God was seen in Jesus Christ, full 
of grace and truth (John 1:14). God is merciful and holy. A truly Godly 
man  will  be  like  God  –  holy  and  merciful.  To  be  a  spiritual  leader,  
you have to be like a lion and like a lamb, for that is how Jesus was. 
Jesus’ words are like burning fire, and also tremendously compas-
sionate. Don’t think that a man who is full of compassion alone is a 
spiritual man. At the same time, one who is only fiery and strict is not 
a spiritual man either. Both are unbalanced. The glory of God is full of 
grace and truth.
In Chapter 4:29, Moses said that the Israelites could find God if they 
searched for Him with all their heart and all their soul. Jeremiah said the 
same thing in Jeremiah 29:13. Many people don’t find God because they 
seek  Him  with  as  much  earnestness  as  they  would  seek  for  a  10-paise  
coin that they lost in the grass at night. How long will you search for that 
coin? You may look for it for some time and if you can’t find it, you move 
on.  But  if  you  had  misplaced  a  bundle  of  ten  thousand  rupees  some-
where, how long would you search for that? Do you seek for God like that? 
God is a rewarder only of those who diligently seek Him (Hebrews 11:6). 
How eagerly do you seek for God? How eagerly do you seek for victory 
over sin? How keen are you to overcome your anger and your sexual 
lust? How eager are you to understand the Scriptures and to be useful 
in His kingdom? How eagerly do you seek to be filled with the Holy 
Spirit – not just once, but daily? How eager are you to be constantly 
fresh in your Christian life? If you have not received these things that 
I have just mentioned, all of which are the will of God for you, it must 
be because you have not sought God with all your heart. Jesus taught 
us to ask and seek and knock until our Father in heaven answered. It 
was the same principle that Moses was teaching here.
In Chapter 5, we find the 10 commandments repeated. Here, one more 
reason is given for keeping the Sabbath in verse 15: They were to keep 
the Sabbath in remembrance of the fact that they did not get deliverance 
from Egypt by their own power. It was the Lord Who brought them out 
of  Egypt.  They  had  tried  for  430  years  to  get  free,  but  they  could  not.  
Then  the  Lord  set  them  free  in  one  night.  That  then  was  the  message  
of the Sabbath: The man who trusts in God accomplishes more than the 
man who is busy with activity. But the Israelites forgot that lesson very 
quickly. We read, later on in their history, that they disobeyed God and 
worked on the Sabbath again and again in order to make more money. 
They tilled their land in the seventh year when God told them not to. But 
what  did  they  get  for  all  that  labour?  God  sent  them  into  captivity  for  
another 70 years in Babylon. But the one who trusts in God enters into 
God’s  rest  and  rests  from  his  struggling,  even  as  God  rested  from  His  

A Fresh Repetition of God’s Laws                                                                                                           119
Deuteronomy
work on the Sabbath day. This is the message of the Sabbath (Hebrews 
4:9, 10).
In Chapter 5:29, we read of one of God’s greatest longings for His people. 
It is rare to find the word “O” in Scripture. But here we see God using it: 
“O that they had such a heart in them that they would fear Me and keep 
all My commandments always that it may go well with them and with their 
sons forever.” God longs for it to go well with us and our children forever. 
Do you know that? He wants us to have the very best always. And He has 
given us His commandments so that it might go well with us. The Bible 
is  the  “Manufacturer’s  Instructions.”  If  you  buy  an  expensive  electronic  
gadget, you will get a booklet of instructions along with it that tells you 
how to use it. You will be very careful to follow those instructions exactly, 
because you don’t want that expensive gadget to blow up or be spoilt. In 
fact, the manufacturer usually advises that the equipment should not be 
switched on or used until you have read all the instructions. Who manu-
factured us? God! Here in the Bible are the instructions on how we can 
function  best  as  human  beings.  If  you  don’t  follow  these  instructions,  
you can mess up your life or your marriage. Many have done just that, 
because they did not do things God’s way. Who can they blame for that? 
No-one but themselves.
Even many believers have messed up their lives because they have not 
been  careful  to  follow  the  “Manufacturer’s  Instructions.”  Even  for  phys-
ical health, I believe the best thing to do is to obey the Scriptures first 
of  all.  When  the  Lord  says,  “I  am  your  Healer,”  He  means,  “I  am  your  
health.” We need to be healthy in order to serve God. And if you want to 
be healthy you have to follow certain laws concerning what you eat and 
what you don’t. A glutton can never be healthy. God says, “Give atten-
tion  to  My  words,  for  they  are  health  to  all  their  whole  body”  (Proverbs 
4:20–22). In the same way, to be spiritual, you must follow certain laws 
concerning spirituality. You have to humble yourself if you want grace, 
for God gives His grace only to the humble. You have to believe in order 
to receive something from God, for God gives us according to our faith. 
All these are spiritual laws. It will go well with us if you follow these laws.
In Chapter 6:4, we read, “The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!” We don’t 
worship three Gods. God is one in three Persons. Then in verse 5, the first 
commandment is described in another way. This is what Jesus quoted in 
Matthew 22:37: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all 
your soul and with all your might.” That is the first commandment. That 
means that we don’t have any place in our hearts for family, property, job, 
or money – because ALL of our heart is given to God. This is Instruction 
No.1  in  the  “Manufacturer’s  Instruction”  Manual.  Don’t  operate  the  
human machine before you have obeyed this commandment. What will 
happen when you love the Lord with all your heart? You will love your wife 
even better! You will love your neighbour better. You will even love your 
enemies, because you don’t have any hatred in your heart anymore.

120 Through the Bible: Repetition of the Law and Review of God’s Dealings 
Deuteronomy
Jealousy,  hatred,  bitterness  and  all  other  sins  against  others  are  
caused  by  not  loving  God  with  all  your  heart.  The  part  of  your  heart  
that should be loving God is filled with jealousy. We overcome sin not by 
battling sin primarily, but by loving God with all our heart. When we love 
God with all our heart, the love of money and property and evil lusts will 
all go away. Consider a girl who is in love with Mr. A, who is not such a 
good person. Her parents try their best to stop her from loving him but 
they can’t succeed. Then one day this girl meets Mr. B who is far more 
handsome, richer and a more pleasant person. Suddenly all her love for 
Mr. A disappears. How did that happen? That can be called “the expulsive 
power of a new affection”. A new love drove out the first love. Apply this to 
the Christian life. Here you are lusting after so many evil things that God 
forbids. You try and try to give up these bad habits but cannot, because 
you love those lusts. Then one day, you see the glory of Jesus and begin 
to love Him with all your heart. What happens? This new love has driven 
out  the  old  affections.  Then  we  have  no  more  interest  in  the  things  of  
this world. It’s “the expulsive power of a new affection”. This is the secret 
of victory over sin. Love God with all your heart and with all your soul – 
which means with all your intellectual power.
If God gave you a brilliant mind, that was not to enable you to make 
money,  or  to  get  on  in  this  world  and  become  a  great  man.  No.  The  
apostle Paul would have been a success in any field he chose, for he was 
such a brilliant man, He could have been a top-rate businessman. And if 
he were living today, he would have been a genius at computers. But he 
decided to use all the faculties God gave him for God alone. That’s how he 
made good use of his life. What have you used your faculties for? 
In Chapter 6:7, we read how it is the responsibility of parents to teach 
the  Word  of  God  to  their  children  at  all  times  from  morning  to  night  
under all types of circumstances. 
Chapter  7:1–6  talks  about  seven  nations  greater  and  stronger  than  
Israel that God would enable them to defeat utterly. This is a picture of 
the victory that God desires to give us over every sin – for seven is the 
perfect number in Scripture (that speaks of completion). It is clear that 
it was going to be God Who would deliver the enemies into Israel’s hand 
because the enemies were stronger than Israel. We must recognise that 
all  our  lusts  are  far  too  strong  for  us.  Only  the  Lord  can  enable  us  to  
overcome them.
When God Blesses Us With Wealth
Chapter  8  is  a  very  important  chapter.  When  Jesus  was  tempted  in  the  
wilderness, each time He overcame Satan with the sword of the Spirit, the 
word of God. He never got into a discussion or an argument with Satan. 
To whatever Satan said, Jesus had only one answer: “It is written.” In the 
three temptations, He quoted from only two chapters in the Old Testament. 

When God Blesses Us With Wealth                                                                                                       121
Deuteronomy
Deuteronomy 8:3 was the first: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but 
by  every  word  that  proceeds  from  the  mouth  of  God.”  The  other  two  
quotations were from Deuteronomy 6:16, “You shall not tempt the Lord 
your  God.”  And  Deuteronomy  6:13,  “You  must  worship  the  Lord  your  
God, and serve Him alone.” 
This shows us that Jesus had studied the Book of Deuteronomy. There 
is  an  answer  in  God’s  word  to  every temptation  and  every problem  we  
can ever face in life, if we know where to find it. I have never come across 
a  problem  in  my  life  that  had  no  answer  in  God’s  Word.  That’s  why  
I want to encourage every believer to be a student of God’s Word. From 
your earliest youth, study God’s Word, and you will find that when you 
face mountains and rivers you can go past all of them and fulfil God’s 
purposes. David says, “By my God I can leap over a wall” (Psalms 18:29). 
There is no obstacle that can stand in our way. There is an answer in the 
Bible if you know where to find it. Jesus studied it intensely as a child 
and as a young man. So He had an answer for every temptation. He could 
not be deceived by Satan.
In Chapter  8:11–15,  Moses  warns  them:  “Beware  lest  you  forget  the  
Lord  your  God  by  not  keeping  His  commandments  and  His  statutes,  
when you have eaten and are satisfied, and have built good houses and 
lived in them, and your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver 
and  gold  multiply,  then  your  heart  becomes  proud  and  you  forget  the  
Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt and led you through the 
great and terrible wilderness with fiery serpents and scorpions.” 
It is easier to think of God when we are in the wilderness or when we are 
struggling to obey God than when we are blessed and have become rich. 
In the days when Noah was building the ark, he was so busy that he 
had no time to get drunk. But as soon as he came out triumphantly from 
the ark as the head of the only family on earth to survive the flood, he 
got drunk.
When  David  was  running  from  cave  to  cave  escaping  from  Saul,  he  
wrote amazing psalms and was very close to God. But when he had plenty 
of ease and money and didn’t have to go to battle himself, but could send 
others to do the fighting for him, and he himself relax in the palace, that 
was when he sinned with Bathsheba. If he had gone to battle that day, 
he would not have seen Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11:1). 
Solomon sinned because he had plenty of ease, comfort and wealth. 
When did Israel start worshipping idols? They never worshipped idols 
during  the  40  years  in  the  wilderness,  after  that  one  incident  with  
the  golden  calf.  But  as  soon  as  they  landed  in  Canaan,  they  started  
worshipping idols very quickly. 

122 Through the Bible: Repetition of the Law and Review of God’s Dealings 
Deuteronomy
When we have plenty, we are in danger. If you are struggling finan-
cially, thank God. That will help you live close to God. But that doesn’t 
mean  that  we  have  to  forget  God  when  we  have  plenty.  No.  I  am  only  
saying that it is more difficult. Jesus said it was difficult for a rich man 
to  enter  the  kingdom  of  God.  He  didn’t  say  it  was  impossible.  So  don’t  
envy the brother who has plenty. It is more difficult for him to be close to 
God. Be thankful if you have less than him. That can be your salvation. 
If you don’t have as many changes of clothes as others, don’t envy them. 
Actually, you are better off, if you could only see it. Don’t envy the person 
who has a bigger house or who has more money than you. Such people 
are in far greater danger. Leave it to God to decide what He should give 
you. Be content with even a little. I have seen how many preachers have 
destroyed themselves through getting plenty. Take a warning from them. 
A wise man learns from the mistakes of others.
In Chapters 9 to 11 Moses gives the new generation of Israelites some 
warnings from the history of their fathers who disobeyed God and died. 
He warns them again that God is a consuming fire (9:3).
In Chapter 11:21 (KJV), Moses told them that God’s longing for them 
was: “that your days and the days of your sons may be multiplied on the 
land like the days of heaven upon earth.” This is God’s will for all of 
us – that our days on earth may be like the days of heaven. God wants us 
even now to have a foretaste of the joy, peace, love, purity and goodness 
of heaven in our homes and in our churches. I have experienced a little 
bit of that. So my life and my ministry have not been a heavy burden for 
me. Not at all. It has been joyful and every day has been exciting, because 
I have learnt to live by the principles of heaven, and not of earth. 
It’s  easy  for  you  to  do  this  when  you  start  your  Christian  life.  But  I  
hope that 40 years from now, you will still determine to live by heaven’s 
principles and not earth’s. Fix your eyes on Jesus Who endured until the 
end – so that your days can be like days of heaven on earth. That is God’s 
will for us.
Chapter  11:24  says,  “Every  place  on  which  the  sole  of  your  foot  shall  
tread shall be yours.” God’s will is that we fulfil all of His will in every 
place, and that we overcome every weakness. In every area of our lives 
we must put our foot down and put the devil under our feet and over-
come him.
In Chapters 12 to 26, various laws are either repeated or freshly given.
False Prophets
Chapter 13 has an interesting section on false prophets. This is a very 
important  passage  for  us  today,  because  false  prophets  abound  in  
Christendom today. We are told here that God allows false prophets to 

Various Laws                                                                                                                                              123
Deuteronomy
come across our path – in order to test us. False prophets and deceivers 
are  a  major  means  by  which  God  tests  our  real  desires  and  longings. 
The  Lord  says,  “If  a  prophet  or  a  dreamer  of  dreams  arises,  or  comes  
across  your  path,  arises  among  you  and  gives  you  a  sign  or  a  wonder,  
and the sign or the wonder comes true...” (13:1, 2). God allows what this 
deceiver prophesies to take place – to test us. There are many such false 
“prophets” who have their consulting rooms and consulting fees (exactly 
like  medical  doctors)  in  Christendom  today.  You  have  to  pay for  their  
prophecies – for they expect a payment. These false prophets try one of 
two methods to get your money. First, they will flatter you and tell you 
that you will indeed prosper where you are planning to go – whether to 
the Arabian Gulf countries or to some Western land, etc. Thus they will 
make  you  happy,  so  that  they  can  receive  a  handsome  gift  from  you!  
And then you will do exactly what they have “prophesied” and thus fulfil 
their  “prophecy”  yourself.  This  is  a  psychological  gimmick  called  “self- 
fulfilling prophecy”. It is an old trick of confidence tricksters. What is the 
net result? You are happy because you got what you thought was “God’s 
approval” from the “prophet” to go where you wanted, in order to make 
money. The prophet is happy because he got a handsome gift. The devil 
is also happy, because he has deceived both you and the false prophet. 
The only ones who are unhappy are God and the angels of heaven! The 
second method these “prophets” adopt is to warn you of some imminent 
danger that you are facing, that you are totally ignorant of! They will say 
that the devil is after you, but they say they will pray for you to free you 
from the danger. That way also they get your money – because you are 
thankful for being saved from some (non-existent) danger!! Their goal in 
both cases is your wallet! But they lead you far away from devotion to 
Christ. The Lord said, “You shall not listen to the words of that prophet, 
for the Lord your God is testing you to find out if you love the Lord your 
God” (verse 3).
Such false prophets always emphasise the earthly and not the heav-
enly. They lead people to be occupied with material things and not with 
spiritual things. “Let us go after other Gods”, is their message – the other 
Gods being ambition, money, comfort, pleasure, etc.
It  says  in  that  passage  that  such  a  prophet  should  be  put  to  death  
(13:5).  How  can  we  apply  that  today?  By  considering  that  person  as  
non-existent – in other words, by having nothing to do with him. These 
are the “Manufacturer’s Instructions.” Let’s follow them and we will never 
be deceived.
Various Laws
Chapter  14  lists  the  animals  and  creatures  that  the  Israelites  were  not 
to  eat.  This  is  a  repetition  of  what  was  spoken  to  the  earlier  genera-
tion  of  Israelites  in  Leviticus  11.  These  laws  were  to  symbolically teach 

124 Through the Bible: Repetition of the Law and Review of God’s Dealings 
Deuteronomy
the Israelites the importance of being holy and set apart for God. These 
laws are not applicable for us today. Jesus declared all foods to be clean 
(Mark 7:19). Paul emphasises that holiness does not come from avoiding 
certain types of food and states categorically that all food is sanctified 
when we pray and eat it (1 Timothy 4:1–5). 
Chapter 15 speaks about releasing people in the Sabbath year. If there 
was a poor man among them, they were not to be tight-fisted and stingy 
and hard-hearted, but generous toward their brother (verses 7, 8). The 
Lord took great interest in poor people.
In Chapter 16, we read of the three feasts for which all male members 
had to go to Jerusalem.
Chapter  17:14–19: It  was  not  God’s  will  for  Israel  to  have  a  king,  for  
He was to be their king (See 1 Samuel 8:7). But God always gives people 
the freedom to choose His second-best if they don’t want His best. So He 
told them that if they chose to have a king, he must read this law every 
day and fear God and obey it fully. That is another very good passage for 
Christian leaders today. They must carefully study God’s Word, fear Him 
and obey Him.
Chapter18:1–7: Here  Moses  gives  them  some  more  laws.  He  forbids  
spiritism and witchcraft (verse 9–14). Instead of seeking the fortune- 
tellers,  the  Lord  says  that  He  will  raise  up  a  Prophet  in  the  future  
whom  they  were  to  listen  to  (verse  14–19)  –  a  clear  reference  to  the  
coming of Christ.
In Chapter  18:20,  they  are  warned  against  saying  something  in  the  
Lord’s  Name  which  He  has  not  commanded.  This  is  a  warning  that  is  
very needed by Christians today, for there are many who “prophesy” in 
certain types of Christian groups saying, “Thus says the Lord...” – to give 
an air of authority to what they are saying. And then they continue to 
say whatever has come into their minds. This is such a serious sin that 
God said that such a prophet was to be killed. God says, “I did not speak 
to them, yet they prophesied” (Jeremiah 23:21). In spite of all these warn-
ings in God’s Word, hardly a voice is raised against this sinful practice. 
Multitudes  of  sincere  Christians  are  being  led  astray  by  all  these  false  
prophecies today. 
We have no right to say “Thus says the Lord” except when we are quoting 
something that God has actually said in the Scriptures. Otherwise we 
are adding to the Word of God.
In Chapter  18:21,  22,  we  are  told  of  one  way  in  which  to  identify  a  
false prophet: What he prophesies is not fulfilled. Such a man is a false 
prophet. In spite of this clear teaching in Scripture, there are multitudes 
of Christians today who make allowance for the “mistakes” that today’s 

Various Laws                                                                                                                                              125
Deuteronomy
prophets  make  –  and  still  continue  to  listen  to  them.  They  ignore  this  
verse completely and twist it so that it no longer means what it plainly 
says. What this verse is teaching is that a true prophet will have a success 
rate of 100% in his prophecies – not even 99%. God has given us enough 
warnings in His Word to avoid being deceived.
However holy and good and evangelical a man may be, if what he has 
prophesied has not been fulfilled exactly – even once – he has prophe-
sied falsely, And if he does not humble himself and acknowledge his 
error, he is also a false prophet. God says that we should not bother 
about such a man thereafter. How many Christians are willing to obey 
God here?
Chapter  19  is  a  repetition  of  the  cities  of  refuge  that  were  to  be  set  
apart for those who accidentally killed someone, to escape to.
Chapter 20:1–7: When the Israelites went to war, they were told here to 
go forth in perfect trust in God without any fear. Those who were afraid 
or those who were more interested in their wives, or houses or vineyards 
than in fighting the Lord’s battles should go back home, lest they make 
the other soldiers cool off in their devotion to the Lord. God wants only 
those who are wholehearted to serve Him even today – those for whom 
His Name and His Kingdom are more important than personal interests.
In Chapter 21, various other laws are given – about marriage matters 
and stoning rebellious children etc.
In Chapter  21:22,  23,  we  read  that  anyone  who  is  hung  on  a  tree  is  
cursed by God. This is the verse Paul quotes in Galatians 3:13 to show 
that Christ became a curse for us when he hung on Calvary, so that He 
might  deliver  us  from  the  curse  that  should  have  come  on  us  for  not  
having kept all of God’s laws perfectly.
In Chapter  22:5,  God  gave  them  laws  on  men’s  and  women’s  cloth-
ing.  This  was  an  Old  Testament  law  that  was  meant  to  symbolically  
teach us that the differences God has made between the sexes must be 
maintained and the different functions that He has ordained for each 
sex must be respected.
We  see  God’s  immense  care  for  His  animal-creation  in  the  law  that  
forbade  the  Israelites  from  taking  a  mother  bird  along  with  her  young,  
if both were found in a nest (22:6, 7). The compassion of God even for 
animals teaches us one great truth: How much more He will care for us, 
His children.
In Chapters 23 and 24, we read laws on morality, cleanliness, divorce 
and  various  laws  that  made  sure  that  the  poor  were  not  exploited  but  
cared for. It is really profitable for all of us to read these laws given in 
Chapter 24:6–21, to see God’s intense concern for the poor. 

126 Through the Bible: Repetition of the Law and Review of God’s Dealings 
Deuteronomy
Various other laws are listed in Chapters 25 and 26. And in Chapter 27, 
a curse is pronounced publicly on those who commit certain sins.
Chapter  28  is a long chapter that is divided into two parts. The first 
14 verses are promises about how God would bless them if they obeyed 
His laws. The next 54 verses are about how God would punish them if 
they  disobeyed  His  laws.  This  was  the  only  way  God  could  get  man  to  
obey Him under the law – by the hope of reward and the threat of punish-
ment. This is the method we use with little children too. We could call it 
“the chocolate and stick” method – the promise of a chocolate if they obey 
and punishment with a stick if they disobey. Under the Law, God treated 
all men like little children. But under the new covenant, God treats us 
like  adults.  Jesus  said,  “If  you  love  Me  keep  My  commandments”  (John 
14:15). Adult sons obey their father out of love and reverence – not out 
of  fear.  And  thereby  we  can  know  whether  we  ourselves  are  babies  or  
adults. Do you serve the Lord or give money or service to Him or pray to 
Him or fast – in hope (expectation) of some reward, or perhaps to escape 
punishment. If so, you still have the spirit of the old covenant.
In Chapter  31:7,  8,  we  see  Moses  charging  Joshua  with  the  respon-
sibility  to  lead  Israel  forward.  Again  we  notice  how  Moses  gave  that  
responsibility  to  the  man  God  chose,  and  not  to  any  of  his  own  sons.  
Unfortunately, it has become an universal practice in Christendom today 
for a man who starts a church or a ministry to hand over the leadership 
of his work to his own son or daughter. They feel that their own family 
members must reap the financial and positional benefits that they them-
selves have worked so hard to build up. But in the church of God, we are 
commanded not to “know any man according to the flesh” (2 Corinthians 
5:16)  –  not  even  our  own  family  members. But then it is rare to find 
leaders like Moses anywhere in Christendom today.
In Chapter 32, we read the song of Moses. Moses also wrote a psalm – 
Psalm 90 – which was another song. 
In Chapter 33, we see God blessing the tribes of Israel. In verses 2, 3, 
we have a lovely statement by Moses that shows how he viewed the laws 
of God – as an expression of God’s immense love for His people. “At God’s 
right hand, there was a fiery law for them” (verse 2 - Literal translation). 
What  did  that  prove?  “That  indeed  He  loves  His  people.”  (verse  3).  It  is  
good for us to recognise that God’s fiery commandments are a proof of 
His tremendous love for us. A soft, easy law would have proved that He 
did not love the Israelites.
In Chapter  34,  we  read  about  the  death  of  Moses.  Israel  entered  the  
promised land, 30 days after Moses died.

JOSHUA
Possessing the Land
T
he book of Joshua tells us how Israel possessed the promised land. 
The  book  is  similar  in  many  ways  to  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles.  In  
both  books,  it  was  a  new  beginning  and  we  read  of  tremendous  
manifestations of God’s power. Joshua was a great leader and he brought 
the Israelites into the promised land. We also see in the book of Judges 
(immediately  after  the  book  of  Joshua)  how  backsliding  came  in  very  
quickly  after  Joshua’s  time.  In  the  New  Testament  too,  as  soon  as  the  
apostles died, backsliding began very quickly in the churches (Revelation 
2, 3). This teaches us that when God’s people don’t have good leaders, 
backsliding begins very quickly.
The book of Joshua pictures God as a God of war. That may be difficult 
to understand. But God is a God of war, because He is a God of love. 
He hates anything that harms mankind, just like a loving father would 
make war against the diseases that are in his children. 
The Old Man and the Flesh
The land of Canaan is not a picture of heaven (as some believers sing in 
their hymns) because there are no giants to be killed in heaven! Canaan 
is actually a description of the Spirit-filled life of victory, where the giants 
of sin – the lusts in our flesh – are crucified. All the giants were not killed 
in a moment. They were killed one by one.
The people of Israel had to go across two bits of water on their journey 
to  Canaan.  One  was  the  Red  Sea  and  the  other  was  the  River  Jordan. 
Both these speak of death. We see in 1 Corinthians 10 that going into the 
Red Sea is a picture of water-baptism. The River Jordan is a picture of 
another kind of death. This was where John the Baptist baptised Jesus 
1500 years later.

128 Through the Bible: Possessing the Land
Joshua
The Bible teaches that our old self was crucified by God on the cross 
(Romans 6:6). We cannot crucify our old man. The old man (the mind 
that wants to sin) was crucified with Christ on the cross. It was God 
who did that. But there is something else that we have to crucify – our 
flesh (the storehouse of desires). Galatians 5:24 says, “Those who are 
Christ’s have crucified their flesh with its lusts and its affections.”
The flesh is different from the old man. The flesh with its lusts is like a 
gang of robbers that tries to come into our heart to pollute us. The old man 
is like an unfaithful servant who lives inside our heart, and opens the door 
every time these robbers come to steal. Which of the two does God kill? He 
kills the servant. The gang of robbers is still strong and active. This is why 
we are all tempted in exactly the same way after we are converted as we 
were before we were converted. That proves that the robbers are still alive. 
They still want to enter our heart – even after we are converted. But some-
thing else has died within us – the servant who opened the door for these 
thieves  (the  old  man). God  killed  him  and  put  a  new  servant  within  us  
when we were born again – a servant who does not want to open the door 
for the thieves. When temptation comes now to us, the new servant says, 
“No.” Then how do believers fall into sin? Because they don’t feed the new 
servant well! Then he is not strong enough to keep the door shut against 
the robbers. And the robbers push their way in. That’s how a believer sins.
But there is a vast difference between a believer sinning and an unbe-
liever  sinning  –  because  the  believer  doesn’t  want  to  sin,  and  the  
unbeliever wants to sin. In fact, that’s the test of whether you are really 
born again or not. The proof of being born again is not whether you sin 
or not, but whether you want to sin. If you still want to sin, I would say 
you  are  not  converted.  When  people  come  asking  for  water-baptism  
I  ask them one question, “Do you want to sin any more – even once?” 
I don’t ask them, “Will you sin?” because nobody can say they will not 
sin. It is the ‘want to’ that is the old man.
These are the two deaths the New Testament speaks of. Both of these 
are pictured beautifully in the history of Israel. The army of Pharaoh was 
buried in a moment under the Red Sea. That’s a picture of the death of 
the old man. Who did that? God. The old man was crucified on the cross 
by  God.  Then  the  Israelites  crossed  Jordan,  which  speaks  of  another  
death. We accept our co-crucifixion with Christ to our lusts. Those who 
are Christ’s have taken this attitude towards their lusts. The lusts are still 
there and the giants are still ruling the land. But Joshua and the Israelites 
had determined to kill them one by one. It is we who have to kill our lusts 
– one by one – as we are tempted. We must put to death the deeds of the 
body ourselves – by the power the Spirit gives us (Romans 8:13). This is 
very different from the Egyptian army being buried in a moment by God.

Why God Punishes                                                                                                                                    129
Joshua
Scripture  is  so  exact  when  it  comes  to  its  application  in  the  New  
Testament. If we open ourselves to the Holy Spirit, He will reveal these 
hidden  things  to  us.  The  Bible  is  an  exciting  book.  It’s  so  perfect  and  
exact in its Old Testament typology of new covenant life. Those godly men 
in the Old Testament did not understand all this then, but we can under-
stand what these events typified today. The land of Canaan symbolises 
our body, that has been ruled by the giants of many lusts, for many years. 
But we have taken an attitude towards those giants that says, “I am going 
to consider myself dead to sin.” Jesus said we have to take up the cross 
every day. That’s not killing the old man. The old man has already been 
crucified. To take up the cross is to put our self-will (which is what the 
Bible calls our “flesh”) to death daily, in the power of the Spirit.
If you take a relaxed attitude towards sin in your life, you can put on 
the  old  man  once  again  (Ephesians  4:22). A  person  who  “continues  to  
live according to the flesh” will die spiritually – even if he was alive once. 
Romans 8:13 – which is written to believers – is crystal clear on this point. 
In Joshua, the typology is of the lusts in our flesh being put to death by 
us.  So,  the  spiritual  theme  of  the  book  of  Joshua is:  “Overcoming  sin”. 
The book encourages us to be victorious in the battle against our lusts.
The  leader  of  the  Israelites  in  this  battle  was  Joshua.  Joshua is  the  
Hebrew word for Jesus. Jesus is the English word. The Hebrew word is 
Jehoshua, meaning “the Lord is Saviour”. Matthew 1:21 says, “You shall 
call  His  name  Jesus  because  He  is  a  Saviour  Who  will  save  His  people  
from their sins.” Moses could not lead the Israelites into Canaan typifying 
the fact that the Law cannot lead us into a life of victory over sin.
Our  leader  who  leads  us  into  this  battle  is  Jesus,  Who  was  Himself  
tempted in all points as we are (Hebrews 4:15). Joshua did not sit in a 
tent himself and tell the other Israelites to go and fight. No. He went in 
front and fought himself and said, “Follow me.” That’s what Jesus has 
done  too.  He  is  the  Captain  of  our  salvation  (Hebrews  2:10).  He  has  
gone ahead of us, and that’s why we are told to run the Christian race, 
“looking unto Jesus, Who in His earthly life, endured the cross, despis-
ing the shame, conquered sin and Satan and is seated at the right hand 
of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:1, 2). In our battle today, when we 
are tempted, we must look at our Captain who has gone in front and 
say, “Lord, You were also tempted just like I am being tempted at this 
moment; and You overcame. Give me grace that I can overcome too.” 
There can be no defeat when we follow this Captain. We are defeated 
only when we don’t follow this Captain.
Why God Punishes
The people of Canaan, whom God commanded to be killed, were being 
punished  just  like  Sodom  and  Gomorrah  was  punished  and  like  the  
world in Noah’s day was punished. The whole earth had become corrupt 

130 Through the Bible: Possessing the Land
Joshua
in Noah’s time with sexual sins (Genesis 6:11). The Canaanites too were 
indulging  in  degrading  sexual  sins  and  Satan-worship.  And  so  “the 
land itself spewed them out”. (Leviticus 18:24, 25). Deuteronomy 9:4 and 
18:10–12 give us clear reasons as to why God destroyed the Canaanites. 
Where there are polluting influences in any nation that defile and corrupt 
the land, the only thing to do is to punish such a nation by eliminating 
the people – lest their influence spread and corrupt others too. 
A God of love destroys some people just like a kind doctor amputates 
a man’s foot when the gangrene in his foot is so severe that it threatens 
to destroy the whole body. If you saw a doctor sawing off somebody’s leg, 
and  did  not  understand  medicine,  you  would  imagine  that  the  doctor  
hated  that  man.  But  actually  the  opposite  would  have  been  true.  The  
doctor was doing it in love. God also acts in love for the world when He 
cuts  off  certain  people  who  would  otherwise  corrupt  it.  Wiping  out  the  
world’s population at the time of the flood was an act of love, so that 
the  human  race  could  be  preserved  without  being  totally  controlled  by  
demons  (Genesis  6:2  –  where  the  “sons  of  God”  refer  to  God’s  creation  
–  the  angels  who  fell).  The  apostle  Paul  once  smote  a  man  with  blind-
ness because he was leading another person astray (Acts 13:8–12). I have 
heard  of  cases  of  people  who  were  smitten  dead  by  God  because  they  
opposed a revival. So what we read of in Joshua is not the murder of the 
Canaanites, but rather a surgery to cleanse the land.
Many years earlier, when Abraham was living in Canaan, there were 
Canaanites  there.  But  God  did  not  destroy  the  Canaanites  then.  God  
waited for over 400 years, because, as He told Abraham, the Canaanites 
were  not  “ripe  for  judgement”  at  that  time  (Genesis  15:16).  We  pluck  
mangoes when they are ripe. God also waits for man’s sin to become ripe 
for judgement, before He judges. He judged Sodom and Gomorrah when 
their sin was ripe. So too with the Canaanites.
After Israel had occupied Canaan for 700 years, when they committed 
the same sins as the Canaanites, God drove them out of the land too. The 
Assyrians  came  and  captured  them.  125  years  later,  when  Judah,  the  
southern kingdom, rejected the messages of God’s prophets and ripened 
for judgement, God sent the Babylonians to destroy them too. God is not 
partial. Whether  it  be  the  Canaanites  or  the  Israelites  or  the  people  of  
Judah, His standards are the same. If His people keep on violating His 
standards and ignoring His prophets, He performs the same surgery on 
them  too.  God  does  the  same  with  us  too.  If  God  were  to  excuse  your  
sin, it would prove that He did not love you. If a father were to allow his 
children to live with their diseases, it would prove that he did not really 
love his children.
Entering the Life of Victory
Chapter  1:1,  2:  “After  the  death  of  Moses  the  servant  of  the  Lord,  the  
Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun saying, ‘Moses My servant is dead. 

Entering the Life of Victory                                                                                                                     131
Joshua
Now then arise and cross this Jordan.’ ” It was God Himself Who exalted 
and appointed Joshua to be the leader after Moses. Leadership cannot be 
exercised effectively, if God Himself has not appointed us to that position.
The Lord told Joshua that every place on which his feet trod would be 
given to him (verse 3), and that no man would be able to stand before 
him throughout his life (verse 5). This is symbolic of the New Testament 
promise  given  us  in  Romans  6:14,  “No  sin  will  be  able  to  master  you,  
because  you  are  under  grace.”  The  land  of  Canaan  had  been  ruled  by  
many giants in the past. But they would all be defeated. Not a single sin 
(however powerful) will be able to overcome us. That is God’s will for us. 
But Joshua had to actually put his foot down on a piece of territory and 
claim it in the Lord’s Name. Only then would it be his. So with us too. We 
must claim our inheritance by faith. If we do not lay hold of God’s prom-
ises as ours, they will never be fulfilled in our lives. 
Paul claimed his rights in the gospel in Jesus’ Name, and as a result 
came into a glorious life. He says in 2 Corinthians 2:14, “Thanks be to God 
who leads us in victory always.” “Always in victory” was Paul’s song of 
triumph – and that can be our song too. 
But  most  Christians  never  enter  into  this  life  of  victory.  600,000  
Israelites came out of Egypt; but only two of them – Joshua and Caleb – 
entered Canaan. About the same proportion of Christians (2 in 600,000) 
enter into a life of victory today also. Joshua and Caleb entered the prom-
ised  land  because  they  had  this  attitude:  “If  God  has  told  us  to  occupy  
the land, we can do it.” That is faith. Faith reckons only with the promise 
of  God,  and  never  with  the  difficulties  facing  us.  The  other  Israelites  
said, “This is impossible. The giants are so big and powerful.” Today also 
Christians  feel  it  is  impossible  to  overcome  anger  and  lusting  with  the  
eyes,  because  these  lusts  are  so  powerful  and  have  ruled  them  for  so  
long. Such believers remain defeated all their lives and (spiritually speak-
ing) perish in the wilderness.
The river of the Spirit that flows from heaven through us must not find a 
polluted channel in our heart, to flow through – a channel polluted by dirty 
thoughts, murmuring, complaining and the love of money. No. It must find 
a clean, pure channel that is free from sin. Then that river can bless people 
around us with the clear water of heaven. The great tragedy in Christendom 
today is that its preachers are not pure inside. They have not overcome sin 
in their hearts and in their private lives. They have not overcome the love of 
money, the lust of the eyes, bitterness, the spirit of competition with other 
Christian leaders/organisations, jealousy, telling lies, shouting angrily at 
their wives, and unrighteousness in many other areas. Yet they preach to 
God’s people. What can they teach God’s people? Only what they are prac-
tising – namely, how to be angry with one’s wife, how to be bitter, how to 
be jealous, and how to compete with others! Anything else they teach will 
only be hollow theories. All the Bible-knowledge that you acquire through 
study is useless if you are not an overcomer in your life. 

132 Through the Bible: Possessing the Land
Joshua
The Lord assured Joshua “I will be with you.” This was why no man 
would be able to stand before Joshua. We do not overcome sin through 
believing  some  doctrine  or  by  having  some  experience.  No.  It  is  the  
constant presence of the Lord with us, through his Spirit, alone, that can 
enable us to overcome. God is looking for such leaders in Christendom 
today whom He can support and endorse, because their hearts are pure. 
The Lord told Joshua: “Be strong and courageous. You will lead these 
people to possess this land which has been ruled by their enemies for so 
long” (verse 6). We are not to be afraid of any sin. We are to go out and 
enable God’s people to overcome sin in their bodies – bodies that have 
been ruled by sin for years. It’s not enough merely to bring them to faith 
and the two baptisms – putting the blood on the doorposts, crossing the 
Red Sea, and being enveloped in the cloud. That is just the beginning. 
That is only the kindergarten lesson. Do we stop our children’s educa-
tion once they have passed the kindergarten class? No. But that’s what’s 
happening in Christendom today.
The pillar of cloud – the baptism in the Holy Spirit – came to lead them 
into the promised land. They should have entered in, in 2 years, but 
they didn’t enter for 40 years, because their leaders were unbelieving. 
“Faith  comes  by  hearing”  (Romans  10:17).  If  believers  are  not  taught  
these truths in the church-meetings, how can they believe? Then how 
can they overcome sin?
The Lord told Joshua: “Be strong and courageous and be careful to do 
everything that is written in God’s Word. Don’t turn to the left or to the 
right”  (1:7).  If  God’s  Word  says,  “Sin  shall  not  have  the  mastery  over  
you,” (Romans 6:14), believe it and confess it. Don’t turn to the left or 
the right. That means: Don’t reduce the breadth of that promise. Don’t 
reduce it to include only some sins. At the same time, don’t make it to 
mean more than what it says. Don’t say that we can be as perfect as 
Christ was, on this earth. We cannot be sinlessly perfect on this earth. 
That is not what that promise says. It is referring only to victory over to 
what we know to be sin (conscious sin). We can be fully like Christ only 
when He returns. 1 John 3:2 is very clear on that. So let’s not go beyond 
Scripture, and let’s not believe less than what Scripture promises.
Becoming like Christ can be compared to occupying the whole land of 
Canaan or to climbing a very high mountain. When we are converted, our 
sins are forgiven and our past is blotted out. But we are still enslaved by 
many sins. We could compare it to coming to the foot of this mountain. 
Then we begin to climb this mountain. The top of the mountain is perfect 
likeness to Christ. We will reach there only when Christ returns. But we 
don’t have to live at the foot of the mountain – defeated by sin –  perpetually. 
No. The Bible says, “Let us press on to perfection” (Hebrews 6:1). We are 

Entering the Life of Victory                                                                                                                     133
Joshua
exhorted in 2 Corinthians 7:1 to “perfect holiness in the fear of God.” We 
should  not  be  afraid  of  the  word,  “perfection”.  We  must  press  on  to  it. 
Paul said towards the end of his life, “I have not yet reached the top. But 
I  am pressing on” (Philippians 3:12–14). The Lord is now saying to many 
of  us,  “You  have  stayed  at  the  foot  of  this  mountain  long  enough.  Now  
climb it. Press on.” So let’s not turn to the left or to the right.
“This book of God’s Word shall not depart from your mouth” (verse 8). We 
have seen already that we should have God’s Word in our heart. Here we 
see that we also need to have it in our mouth. We must confess the prom-
ises of God’s Word with our mouths. The trouble with many Christians 
today is that they are confessing the things they are lusting after. They 
say, “I confess that I will get a large house. I confess that I will get a better 
job. I confess that I will get a good car”!! Instead of confessing all that, 
let  us  confess  God’s  Word:  “Lord,  I  confess  that  I  will  overcome  anger. 
I  confess that I will overcome lusting with my eyes completely. I confess 
that  I  will  overcome  the  love  of  money.”  These  are  the  things  that  we  
should be confessing with our mouths. But the Devil doesn’t want us to 
confess these. And so he makes us confess our lust for material things. 
You can’t build the church with people who are interested in material 
things. You can build the church only with people who are interested in 
heavenly things and a godly life. Don’t attract the wrong type of people 
to your church by offering people earthly prosperity. Does God’s Word 
promise  you  that  He  will  give  you  a  house  or  a  car?  No.  God’s  Word  
promises that you can overcome sin; that you can come into a life where 
you rejoice in the Lord always – 24 hours a day, without being discour-
aged  or  defeated  –  always  triumphant,  always  rejoicing  and  always  
giving thanks, in everything and for all people. This is the new covenant 
life (Canaan’s land flowing with milk and honey) that the Bible promises. 
Confess it then and say, “Lord, this is the life I want to live all my days.”
That was the life I wanted to live, when I was a young Christian and 
saw what the Bible offered me. But when I looked at the Christian leaders 
around me, I saw that they were defeated by sin. So I said, “Lord, I don’t 
want to judge them. That’s not my business. But I don’t want to look at 
them as my examples either. I want to look at God’s Word alone. I want to 
look only at Your promises. I want to look at Jesus as my only Example.” 
I was defeated for many years as a believer. But once I saw my inherit-
ance  in  Christ,  I  kept  on  confessing  the  promises  of  God  in  Scripture  
– that promised me a life of constant joy and constant victory. God finally 
gave me the desire of my heart. That is how I want to live now, and that 
is how I want to live until the end of my life on earth. 
So don’t let God’s promises depart from your mouth. If you preach this 
message, you may find at times that you are a lone voice for God in the 

134 Through the Bible: Possessing the Land
Joshua
midst of popularity-seeking preachers. Don’t get discouraged. God will 
stand by you until the end.
Joshua  was  commanded  to  meditate  on  God’s  Word  day  and  night.  
We are not to meditate on the need of the sinners in the world. That may 
look like a good thing to think about. But you can’t help those sinners, if 
you don’t meditate on God’s Word day and night. God promised Joshua 
both prosperity and success,  if  he  meditated  on  God’s  Word  (1:8).  The  
real  “prosperity  gospel”  is  one  where  our  lives  become  prosperous  and  
successful in a heavenly and spiritual way. ‘Prosperity and success’ are 
the two things that everyone in the world seeks for. But they don’t seek 
for these in the way God says in Joshua 1:8.
Rahab
In Chapter 2, we see God’s concern for a prostitute in a heathen country. 
Jesus was concerned for the souls of the prostitutes of His day. We see 
the same concern in God’s heart here. Rahab was a well-known prosti-
tute  in  Jericho.  But  she  was  sick  and  tired  of  her  profession,  just  like  
many prostitutes today. Mary Magdalene was sick and tired of her profes-
sion. Very few people recognise that. They just despised the prostitutes. 
Many prostitutes in our cities are not there because they love to be there. 
Many of them have been deceived and forced into such a life. And many 
of them are sick and tired of being exploited by men. They need to hear 
the gospel. I praise God for godly men through the ages who have had a 
burden for saving prostitutes. They shared the burden of God’s heart for 
these unfortunate women. 
Rahab was not a child of Abraham. But she had a longing in her heart 
for God. And God looks all over the world for those who are hungering 
after Him – irrespective of their nationality and irrespective of whether 
they  are  prostitutes  or  religious  leaders.  God  saw  such  a  longing  in  
Rahab’s  heart  and  was  determined  to  make  a  way  for  her  salvation.  
Her name appears on the first page of the New Testament as the great, 
great grandmother of David and as the ancestor of both Joseph and 
Mary the mother of Jesus Christ (Matthew 1:5). She is listed among the 
heroes of faith in Hebrews 11:31. And James quotes her actions as an 
example of faith being accompanied by works (James 2:25).
Did Rahab ever imagine that she would become an example for gener-
ations to come? Or that millions of people would talk about her faith for 
3000  years?  There  is  no  partiality  with  God.  Some  of  you  may  be  like  
Rahab – having lived in sin and made a mess of your lives. You may be 
in some remote corner of the world, with nobody to care for you. But God 
sees the longing in your heart, and He has wonderful ways by which to 
make you His servant and a blessing to millions.

Joshua the Leader                                                                                                                                     135
Joshua
Joshua the Leader
In Chapter 3, we read about how the Israelites crossed Jordan. The Lord 
said to Joshua (verse 7), “This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of 
all Israel, that they may know that just as I have been with Moses, I will 
be with you.” It was very difficult for Joshua to fit into the shoes of Moses. 
Moses was a mighty man of God, who had been feared and respected by 
everyone  for  40  years  –  a  man  who  could  solve  every  problem.  Joshua  
was probably 70 or 80 years old when Moses died. And now he had to 
lead those 2 million Israelites. He must have wondered how the people 
would ever respect him. 
You too may find yourself called to carry on a ministry started by some 
great man of God who was respected by everyone. And you may wonder 
how  you  could  ever  do  it.  The  Lord  says  as  He  said  to  Joshua,  “Don’t 
worry. I will exalt you before them.” God can exalt you before people in 
such a way that they respect you. Don’t wait for some man to make you 
a Director or to give you a title and exalt you. Don’t try to earn respect 
by getting an honorary doctorate from somewhere. God Himself must let 
people  know  that  you  are  His  servant.  God  must  be  with  your  mouth. 
What’s the use of impressing people with titles and human qualifica-
tions?  There  must  be  an  anointing  on  your  life  and  on  the  words  you  
speak. Then people will know that God is with you. Jesus had no earthly 
qualification to impress people with. Neither did the apostles. But they 
had the anointing of the Spirit and God was with them. That’s the impor-
tant thing. Seek for that more than anything else. 
What was Joshua’s qualification for serving God? Just this, that God 
was with him. What was Jesus’ qualification for serving God? Acts 10:38 
says, “God was with Him.” What was Moses’ qualification? God was with 
him. What was David’s qualification to kill Goliath? God was with him. 
What is your qualification for serving God? Is it a degree certificate? 
Do you think Satan is afraid of degree certificates? He doesn’t care for a 
man who has even ten degree certificates. Satan will fear you only if he 
sees that God is with you.
Why did God pick Joshua? There must have been qualities in his life 
that  God  saw  –  especially  his  faith  that  God  would  help  him  conquer  
the  giants  in  Canaan.  When  God  saw  that,  He  said,  “That’s  the  man  
I  am looking for – one who will believe in Me and trust in My promise.” He 
picked  him  and  trained  him  under  Moses.  God  often  trains  a  man  for  
His service by making him work with an older godly man. Elisha worked 
with Elijah and learnt how to be a prophet. Timothy worked with Paul 
and learnt how to be an apostle. Joshua worked with Moses and learnt 
how to be a leader. If God gives you the opportunity to work with an older 
godly man, that is one of the greatest privileges that God can give you to 
equip you for His service. Many Israelites would have wanted to be close 

136 Through the Bible: Possessing the Land
Joshua
to Moses. Many would have liked to take over from Moses as the leader. 
But God chose Joshua.
Chapter 3:9: “Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God.” 
Joshua himself had meditated on God’s Word day and night, and now he 
was able to share that Word with other people. Just like Moses listened to 
God and came out and told the people, Joshua read the law which Moses 
had written and told the people, “I want to tell you what God has said.” 
That’s  our  calling  –  to  tell  people  what  we  ourselves  have  heard  and  
experienced from God – not theories and bright ideas, but what we have 
tasted of God. That’s what Moses, Joshua, Paul and Peter did. 
When the Israelites crossed the River Jordan, the ark of the covenant 
went  in  front  of  them  (3:15).  This  is  a  picture  of  Jesus  Christ  having  
gone  ahead  of  us  and  overcome  all  sin.  We  are  now  called  to  run  the  
race “looking unto Jesus” (Hebrews 12:1, 2). When the priests who were 
carrying  the  ark  approached  the  river  Jordan,  it  was  overflowing  its 
banks. They put their feet into the water by faith, and the water imme-
diately stopped flowing from a long distance away. The Israelites then 
went across. The priests meanwhile stood in the middle of the river until 
everyone had crossed. Again, the riverbed was dry beneath their feet!
Chapter  4:  After  they  had  crossed  over,  Joshua  said,  “We  have  now  
crossed into Canaan. But let’s not rush into battle. Let us first of all give 
thanks to God.” What a wonderful lesson to learn – to kneel down and 
thank and praise the Lord first of all. Joshua then told them to go into 
the  riverbed  and  pick  up  12  stones  (verse  8),  and  to  make  a  memorial  
with them – so that in future years, when children asked their fathers 
what that was, the fathers could tell them of the miracle that God did for 
their ancestors in parting the river. The things that God has done for us 
must be shared with our children, so that they too can have faith. 
Chapter 5:5–9: The Israelite men were now circumcised at Gilgal. All 
these men had been born in the wilderness and none of them had been 
circumcised. There were 40-year-old Israelites among them who had not 
been circumcised. This was a small thing, but it was a mark of the coven-
ant. It symbolised a cutting-off of all confidence in the flesh (Philippians 
3:3). Before they went into battle, all confidence in the flesh had to be cut 
off. That was the first step. They could not overcome the giants in their 
own strength. At last, the reproach of Egypt was rolled away (verse 9).
Chapter  5:13,  14:  The  Captain  of  the  Lord’s  army  now  comes  before  
Joshua.  Notice  that  He  comes  only  after  the  circumcision  is  over  and  
“the reproach of Egypt has been rolled away” (verse 9)! This Captain was 
the Lord Jesus appearing in a vision. Joshua thinks it’s a man and asks, 
“Are You on our side or the enemy’s?” The answer the Lord gives is very 
instructive:  “I’m  not  on  either side.  I  have  come  to  lead  the  army.  You  
must come to My side.”

Victory, Defeat and Deception                                                                                                               137
Joshua
Sometimes, we say, “Lord, I’m going there. Please come and bless me.” 
He won’t. Instead we should ask, “Lord, where are you moving now as 
the Captain of the Lord’s army. Where do You want me to go as Your 
soldier?” And the Lord will reply, “I am going to such-and-such a place. 
Come with Me.” The Christian life is so simple. I don’t have to plan to 
go here and there and ask the Lord to come along with me. No. God is 
not our servant. He is our Captain. 
Change  your  way  of  serving  the  Lord  to  this  way  –  and  you  will  see  
amazing results in your ministry. I know that happened in my ministry. 
We can serve the Lord more efficiently this way. We will then go where 
the Lord has already prepared the ground for us, instead of going to some 
place where the ground is not ready, wasting our time, realising that ten 
years later, and then going elsewhere. God knows the best place to make 
use of us. Wait on Him then for His direction – always.
Victory, Defeat and Deception
Chapter 6:2: “I have already given Jericho into your hand.” This is what 
we need to know when we go to fight against Satan – that He has already 
been  defeated  on  Calvary,  and  that  the  Lord  will  crush  him  under  our  
feet (Romans 16:20). The Lord did not tell Joshua, “I am going to give 
Jericho to you in another seven days.” No. He said, “I have already given 
you the city. Just go in and take it.”
All that the Israelites had to do was to march around the city 13 times 
in  seven  days  and  then  blow  their  trumpets  on  the  seventh  day.  This  
marching  around  a  city  and  the  shouting  has  unfortunately  degener-
ated into a technique that some believers adopt. It is only when the Lord 
commands these things that they have any value. Our calling is to estab-
lish the victory of Calvary wherever we go. We must confess that Satan 
has been defeated. “They overcame Satan by the word of their testimony to 
Satan, saying, ‘Satan you have been defeated on the cross.’ ” – by blowing 
their  trumpets  (Revelation  12:11). I  have  great  joy  in  reminding  Satan  
about his defeat very frequently. I know he doesn’t like to hear it.
I remember once when a lady was brought to my house for prayer. I asked 
her to accept the Lord as her Saviour and to tell Satan that he had been 
defeated on the cross. She suddenly shouted at me with a changed voice 
saying, “I was not defeated on the cross.” I then realised that it was a 
demon inside her that was speaking to me. So I told the demon, “You 
are  a  liar.  You  were defeated  on  the  cross  2000  years  ago.  Get  out  of  
her  in  Jesus’  name.”  The  demon  left  immediately.  Then  she  could  tell  
Satan, “Satan, you were defeated on the cross.” I learned one thing that 
day – that the devil doesn’t like to be reminded that he was defeated on 
the cross. And so I resolved to tell him that frequently myself, and also 
to teach believers across the world to tell him that regularly.

138 Through the Bible: Possessing the Land
Joshua
How many times have you told the devil that he was defeated on the 
cross?  Start  today.  Tell  him  often  that  he  was  defeated  on  the  cross.  
He will hate you for saying that. But I like it when the devil hates me, 
because  then  I  know  that  I  am  on  the  right  track.  Don’t  be  afraid  of  
Satan. You will be able to put him under your feet through the power of 
God, as you proclaim the word of your testimony to him. I am not teach-
ing you a technique here. If you don’t keep your conscience pure and you 
try to resist Satan, he will laugh at you and say, “I recognize Jesus, and I 
know about Paul. But who are you?” (Acts 19:15). So submit to God first 
and  then  resist  the  devil  (James  4:7).  “Be  strong  and  courageous,”  the  
Lord told Joshua (Joshua 1:7).
Chapter  7: Here we read of Israel being defeated for the first time in 
Canaan.  Joshua  asked  the  Lord  why  Israel  was  defeated  and  the  Lord  
replied  saying,  “There  is  sin  in  the  camp.”  One  man  had  stolen  some-
thing that was forbidden. God had told them very clearly, “You must not 
take anything in Jericho for yourselves. It must all be given to the Lord.” 
(6:17). All the Israelites obeyed that command except Achan (7:20) When 
he was finally caught and exposed, he confessed that he had sinned. He 
had seen a beautiful Babylonian dress in a house and coveted it (‘Shinar’ 
is  another  word  for  Babylon.) He  said,  “I  saw,  I  coveted,  I  took,  I  hid.” 
(verse 21) – four steps in temptation. This is how we sin too – and then 
hide our sin. Achan was then stoned to death.
When Achan heard that he would not be permitted to take anything 
of the spoils of battle in Jericho, he must have thought, “If after killing 
these  giants  and  capturing  their  cities,  I  am  not  going  to  get  anything  
myself, during the next 20 years, I will be a poor man. So I better keep 
a little bit for myself.” Little did he realise that the Lord was only testing 
the Israelites at Jericho to see if they would be covetous. In Joshua 8:2, 
we read that the Lord said to the people, that from then on, they could 
take all the spoil of battle in Canaan for themselves! What a fool Achan 
was! If only he had waited, he could have got all the silver and gold and 
garments  that  he  wanted.  But  he  missed  all  of  that  because  he  failed  
when  God  tested  him.  God  will  test  you  too,  to  see  whether  you  grab  
something in covetousness. If you do, you will miss God’s best that He 
had planned for you, for the rest of your life. Instead, if you seek God’s 
kingdom first, He will give you all that you need always.
In Chapter  8:26,  we  read  how  Ai  was  defeated  after  Achan  had  been  
killed. We have to set right the past before we can move forward; other-
wise we will keep on being defeated in the Ai’s of our life. We see here 
that Joshua lifted up his javelin over Ai, just like Moses had lifted up his 
hand on the mountain top. And his soldiers fought and Ai was defeated.
Now, the great danger that all of us face after we have won a victory 
is the danger of becoming complacent. The moment we begin to relax in 
the  Christian  life,  we  are  in  danger  of  being  deceived.  And  that’s  what  
happened to Joshua (Chapter 9). Some Gibeonites – who were Canaanites 

Joshua’s Final Days                                                                                                                                   139
Joshua
who should have been killed – came and met Joshua (9:4). They acted 
craftily and pretended they were coming from a distant place, by wearing 
worn-out clothes and worn-out sandals and carrying old, mouldy bread 
with them (9:5). They also flattered the Israelites. We are in great danger 
when people flatter us. Deception is then very close.  We  read  in  9:14, 
“The  men  of  Israel  did  not  seek  advice  from  the  Lord.”  Joshua  believed  
them and made a covenant with them not to kill them. Three days later 
they discovered that these people were Canaanites who should have been 
killed  (verse  16).  But  by  then  they  had  already  made  a  covenant  with  
them – and they had to keep their word. 
What  can  we  learn  from  this  incident?  It  is  a  warning  for  us  to  be  
careful that we are not deceived by those who flatter us and who want to 
join the church with wrong motives. The safest course of action in such 
cases is to seek the Lord’s advice and not to lean on our own wisdom. 
We must be especially careful immediately after winning great victories. 
We read in the gospels, how, immediately after a time of many miraculous 
healings, Jesus would slip away into the wilderness to pray, to give all 
the glory to His Father (Luke 5:15, 16). That’s an example for us. When is 
it that we are in danger of not seeking counsel from the Lord? When we 
have been victorious. Not when we are defeated. We are in greater danger 
after a victory than after a defeat. Usually after a defeat, we draw close to 
the Lord because we have failed Him in some way. It’s when we have been 
victorious for a while, that we are in danger of spiritual pride. 
Chapter  10:  When  five  kings  attacked  Gibeon,  and  the  Gibeonites 
sought Joshua’s help, the Lord encouraged Joshua by saying, “Don’t be 
afraid. I have given them into your hands. Not one of them will stand before 
you” (verse 8). The word was always, “I have already given”. Victory was 
a  foregone  conclusion,  even  before  the  battle  started.  That  is  how  we  
must go to battle against Satan too. Satan and his demons will not be 
able to stand before us. The gates of hell will never prevail against the 
church of the living God. Joshua came upon them and defeated them and 
“no one could utter a word against Israel” (verse 21). Then Joshua called 
for the men of Israel and said, “Put your feet on the necks of these kings” 
(verse 24). The Bible says in Romans 16:20, “The God of peace will soon 
crush Satan (not on Calvary) under your feet.” Jesus has already defeated 
Satan on Calvary. But Satan will be crushed under our feet now.
Joshua’s Final Days
Chapter 13:1: Joshua was old and advanced in years and the Lord said, 
“There is still much land to be possessed.” It’s a sad thing that there were 
no other leaders in Israel to take over from Joshua. In Christendom today 
too, godly men are dying and so much land is yet to be possessed. 
In Chapter 14:6–15, we see that although Caleb is now 85 years old, 
his faith is still as vibrant as it was 40 years earlier. He asks Joshua to 

140 Through the Bible: Possessing the Land
Joshua
give him a hilly country filled with huge giants and he says that he will 
drive them all out. So Joshua gave Hebron to Caleb. What a challenge 
and an encouragement it is to see godly, old men even today, who like 
Caleb, “have followed the Lord fully” (verse 14), and are overcomers who 
are growing stronger in their faith even in their old age!
In contrast to Caleb’s example, we read the sad story of whole tribes 
in  Israel  who  did  not  drive  out  the  Canaanites  from  many  areas  of  
Canaan. Thrice we read that the Israeli tribes “did not (or could not) drive 
the  Canaanites  out”  (15:63; 16:10; 17:12). This  is  a  picture  of  the  vast  
majority of Christians who have not driven out sins like anger, lust and 
bitterness from their lives – sins that Jesus came to save us from. 
The remaining chapters deal with the occupation of Canaan and the 
tribes settling down to their possessions.
In Chapter 21:44 we read these wonderful words: “The Lord gave them 
rest on every side; not one of all their enemies stood before them.” This 
is the rest referred to in Hebrews 4:8, 9. There it says that the rest and 
victory that Joshua brought the Israelites into was only a picture of the 
rest (and victory over all sin) that Jesus seeks to bring us into. We are 
also told there to be diligent to enter into this rest and not to come short 
of it (Hebrews 4:1, 11).
Chapter 21:45 says, “Not one of the good promises which the Lord had 
made  to  the  house  of  Israel  failed;  all  came  to  pass.”  This  will  be  our  
testimony when we stand with the Lord in eternity too. Many believers 
will discover in that day that they did not experience or enjoy many of 
God’s promises because of their unbelief, like the 600,000 Israelites who 
perished in the wilderness. But those who did believe (like Joshua and 
Caleb) will rejoice in that day that they experienced and enjoyed every 
single one of God’s promises during their earthly lifetime. What regret 
there will be in the hearts of many believers in that day for their unbe-
lief. So let us trust in the Lord with all of our hearts and claim every one 
of His promises, for “all the promises of God are Yes in Christ; and so we 
add our Amen to them to the glory of God” (2 Corinthians 1:20).
In Chapter  22:10–34  we  have  a  beautiful  story  that  illustrates  how  
misunderstandings can be removed and conflict averted, if we adopt the 
simple method of talking to the other party face to face before criticising 
or judging them. The 2½ tribes of Israel who had decided not to live in 
Canaan but on the eastern side of Jordan, made a duplicate of the taber-
nacle’s bronze altar and erected it at the border between their land and 
Canaan. When the other 9½ tribes saw this, they immediately imagined 
that it was an act of rebellion against God. But they decided to clarify the 
matter first. Then they discovered that far from being an act of rebellion, 
it was done only to ensure that succeeding generations of the 9½ tribes 
do not reject the succeeding generations of the 2½ tribes because of their 

Joshua’s Final Days                                                                                                                                   141
Joshua
living on the other side of the river. And the matter was resolved peace-
fully. Would that all Christians had the same common sense to hear the 
other side before coming to their own wrong conclusions!
In Chapter 23, we read of Joshua’s farewell address to the Israelites. 
He knew he was about to die. So he warned the Israelites to be very firm 
in sticking to the Word of God and in being separate from the heathen 
nations  around  them.  Then  the  Lord  would  be  with  them,  and  “one 
Israelite would be able to put 1000 enemies to flight” (verses 6–10)!! But if 
they compromised, then the Lord would fulfil His threats just as He had 
fulfilled His promises – and destroy them (verses 14–16).
In Chapter  24,  Joshua  quickly  reviews  Israel’s  history  from  the  days  
of Abraham and reminds them of God’s care for them. He then exhorted 
them to “fear the Lord and serve Him in sincerity and truth”. And then he 
said that whatever their decision may be, as far as he and his house were 
concerned, they would only serve the Lord (verses 14, 15). We see there 
that Joshua took a decision not only for himself but also for his house. 
He was the head of his house and decided that his children were going to 
worship and serve the Lord alone. He did not offer his children a choice 
in the matter, like he offered the Israelites. Christian leaders need to lead 
their families first of all, and must have children who also follow the Lord 
and serve Him. 
God needs many people like Joshua all over the world today.

JUDGES
Backsliding and Deliverance
T
he Book of Judges describes the backslidden state of Israel, imme-
diately after the very powerful triumph they had experienced under 
the  leadership  of  Joshua  for  many  years.  What  we  learn  here  is  
the same lesson as before, that the state of God’s people depends on the 
quality of their leader. Whenever Israel had good leaders, she prospered. 
The Importance of Good Leaders
Most  of  today’s  leaders  in  Christendom  are  not  strong  enough  to  keep  
God’s people on the straight and narrow path because the leaders them-
selves don’t know God and are compromisers. They seek to please men 
and  to  be  popular,  like  Aaron  (Exodus  32),  and  therefore  God  cannot  
endorse their leadership. Moses and Joshua never sought to be popular.
“The  people  served  the  Lord  all  the  days  of  Joshua  and  all  the  days  
of  the  elders  who  survived  Joshua,  who  had  seen  all  the  great  work  
the  Lord  had  done  for  Israel.”  (2:7).  But  by  the  time  Joshua  and  his  
fellow-elders died, there were no God-fearing men available to replace 
them.  And  so  “all  that  generation  also  died  and  there  arose  another  
generation after them who did not know the Lord, nor the work which 
He had done for Israel” (verse 10). There was nobody who knew God. 
After  many  years  of  moving  in  many  Christian  groups,  I  have  to  say  
that  I  have  met  very  few  Christian  leaders  who  really  know  God,  and  
who  can  say  like  Elijah,  “I  stand  before  the  Lord  God.”  Most  people  in  
Christian  work  today  are  professional  preachers.  They  study  the  Bible  
and get a degree, get someone to support them and then go out to “serve 
God”. There may be some sacrifice in their lives and even zeal. But zeal, 
sacrifice and knowledge are of no use, if a person doesn’t know  God. 

144 Through the Bible: Backsliding and Deliverance
Judges
The  statistics  of  their  work  may  be  impressive,  but  the  quality  of  their  
converts will be poor, because they don’t know God. They may say that 
they have born-again believers in their church. But are these “believers” 
disciples of Christ? There is a vast difference between spiritual believers 
and carnal believers. Any man of God knows that it is better to have a 
small church of spiritual believers, than a large church of carnal ones. 
That’s like saying that it is better to have a few 1000-watt bulbs than a 
hundred zero-watt bulbs. 
We are to be the light of the world. But the intensity of our light depends 
upon how much we know God. If the leader doesn’t know God, the people 
won’t  know  God  either.  You  can  study  the  Bible  and  teach  it  to  your  
church-members, and they will know the Bible. But that would be like 
teaching them chemistry in a classroom. That won’t help them to know 
God. People can’t come to know God by getting Biblical information. You 
can  know  God  only  as  you  go  through  trials  and  testings.  You  have  to  
humble yourself in those trials and have to have a yearning in your heart 
for God. That is how you can know God, not by sitting in a meeting. We 
certainly  need  to  know  the  Scriptures,  but  we  need  to  go  beyond  the  
Scriptures and get to know God. “The people who know their God will be 
strong” (Daniel 11:32). These Israelites did not know God and therefore 
“they did evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals” (2:11). That 
was because Joshua had died, and now there was no God-fearing leader 
to lead them.
The  history  of  Christianity  in  the  last  2000  years  is  replete  with  
numerous  examples  of  men  whom  God  raised  up  to  start  a  church  
or  a  movement  that  brought  revival  in  their  lifetime.  But  once  they  
died, their church (or movement) declined just like the churches and 
movements before them. The new generation holds the same doctrine 
as their founder and the same theory of sanctification; but they are 
not holy as their founder was. Many of them claim to have the same 
“baptism in the Holy Spirit” that their founder had; but their life and 
ministry do  not  have  the  same  anointing.  Something  is  missing. The 
founder knew God, but the followers knew only the founder. And so God 
has to raise up another man and start something new.
God  has  always  done  His  greatest  work  in  the  church  through  indi-
vidual men whom He has raised up in different generations in different 
lands.  Around  such  a  man  God  gathers  together  a  few  people  who  are  
concerned not so much for numbers as for quality – for a pure testimony 
for  God  in  their  generation.  I  believe  that  India  needs  many  such  men  
and  women.  In  the  book  of  Judges, when God could not find a man, 
He  found  a  woman  –  Deborah.  That’s  an  encouragement  to  all  sisters. 
Whenever God can find a totally yielded man, He will begin to use him to 
the measure in which he is surrendered. Not all leaders are of the same 

Modifying God’s Commands                                                                                                                   145
Judges
quality,  because  not  all  are  equally  surrendered.  The  book  of  Judges 
describes  certain  leaders  whom  God  raised  up;  but  none  were  of  the  
quality of Moses or Joshua. Gideon, for example, was a good, anointed 
man, when he started out; but towards the end of his life he worshipped 
idols. So we see that the book of Judges has a very relevant message for 
our time.
Modifying God’s Commands
Israel failed to conquer the Canaanites; and the Lord said to them, (2:1, 2), 
“I have brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land which I had 
made a covenant with you. And I told you, ‘You shall make no covenant 
with the inhabitants of the land, you shall tear down their altars.’ But you 
have not obeyed Me.”
The Israelites followed their own reasonings – just like many Christian 
preachers do today, who don’t preach the whole counsel of God, but 
modify God’s Word to suit their congregations and the times and the 
culture in which they live. 
The Israelites also modified God’s commands. So God said, “I will not 
drive out your enemies.” You will not overcome sin, you will live with your 
problems all your life. “These people will become like thorns in your sides 
and their gods will be a snare to you” (2:3). When the sons of Israel heard 
this, they wept and offered sacrifices, but they didn’t change. 
Many Christians get all stirred up when they hear a message like this 
and weep and fast and pray; but they don’t change. They go back to their 
old ways very soon, because their leaders lead them in the wrong direc-
tion. There are very few who say, “I want to know God and I want to live 
by the standards of God’s word, not by the standards preached by my 
leader.” God wants you preachers to be like Moses and Joshua who can 
lead a number of people in your locality to the whole truth of God. If you 
want to be such a man, then don’t be like the Israelites here. Be a man/
woman of God who knows God.
Seven Cycles of Backsliding and Thirteen Judges 
In  the  book  of  Judges,  we  read  of  13  judges  whom  God  raised  up  in  
Chapters 3 to 16. The fourteenth judge was Samuel whom we read about 
in 1 Samuel. The names of most of these judges are not so well known.
*
The first judge was a man called Othniel who was the son-in-law and 
the nephew of Caleb (3:9). It says here that “the Spirit of the Lord came 
upon  him  and  he  judged  Israel”  (3:10).  That  occurred  frequently  in  the  
book of Judges. The Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon and on Samson 
*
   The timeline of the judges is given on p. 154.

146 Through the Bible: Backsliding and Deliverance
Judges
to equip them to lead God’s people (6:34; 14:6). It was the Spirit’s anoint-
ing alone that enabled them to rule Israel. That anointing alone can help 
us to guide and lead God’s people today, as well.
We may be born again, and that is certainly the work of the Holy Spirit. 
But  we  must  still  know  the  Spirit  of  the  Lord  coming  upon  us  and  
empowering us to serve the Lord. Don’t be satisfied with an emotional 
experience that you got in some meeting. Don’t even be satisfied with 
speaking in tongues. You can speak in tongues and yet not be filled 
with the Holy Spirit. Don’t ever be satisfied without the power of the 
Holy Spirit. You can never, never do God’s work without the power of 
the Holy Spirit. Even Jesus who lived a perfect life for 30 years – Who 
was  born  of  the  Spirit,  and  Who  had  lived  in  obedience  to  the  Holy  
Spirit for 30 years – had to be anointed by the Holy Spirit before He 
went  out  to  serve  His  Father.  As  He  prayed  in  the  river  Jordan,  the  
Spirit  of  God  came  upon  Him.  Follow  His  example.  Any  amount  of  
knowledge  or  natural  gifts  can  never  be  a  substitute  for  this  anoint-
ing.  And  we  need  to  live  under  this  anointing  constantly.  Samson’s  
example is a tragic reminder to us how we can be anointed at one time, 
and then lose it later.
During  all  the  40  years  that  Othniel  ruled  Israel,  there  was  peace  
(3:11). But then Othniel died. Again the sons of Israel did evil in the sight 
of the Lord. And when they did evil, the Lord allowed the king of Moab to 
enslave them for 18 years (3:14).
In the book of Judges we see seven such cycles – backsliding, followed 
by punishment, followed by God raising up a judge to deliver them. Many 
believers live in such a cycle all their lives – backsliding, repenting, being 
delivered  and  backsliding  all  over  again  and  so  on....  They  keep  going  
round in an endless circle. They go to a meeting and get stirred up, and 
dedicate themselves. When the revival meeting is over, their backsliding 
starts  very  soon.  Then  one  day,  another  anointed  preacher  comes  and  
holds meetings and they get stirred up again.
Is it the will of God that we should live in this endless cycle? Certainly 
not! Today we can have the Holy Spirit with us all the time. In those days 
the Spirit would come upon just one leader, and everyone was dependent 
on that leader. But not now. Today we can all receive the Spirit and we 
don’t have to be dependent on any preacher stirring us up. We can have 
the fire of God burning in our hearts all the time.
After  18  years  of  serving  Moab,  the  Israelites  cried  out  to  the  Lord  
(verse 15). And God raised up another deliverer for them – Ehud. He was 
the second judge. I have wondered why they waited for 18 years before 
they cried out for deliverance from their slavery. Why didn’t they cry out 
within one month of being enslaved? Why does a person today live defeated

Judges
by sin for 18 years (or even 40 years in some cases), before he seeks for 
victory over sin? I don’t know why. But it is happening all around us.
Ehud  subdued  Moab  and  the  land  was  undisturbed  for  80  years  
(verse  30).  But  then  again  they  backslid  and  God  raised  up  Shamgar,  
who killed 600 Philistines with an ox-goad. That was certainly through 
the anointing of the Spirit, as Samson would do later.
Then the sons of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord again and the 
Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin the king of Canaan. The Canaanites 
whom  Israel  was  supposed  to  exterminate,  now  have  a  king  and  are  
ruling Israel! Believers are supposed to rule over sin; but in most cases, 
sin rules over them. 
Jabin had 900 iron chariots and he oppressed Israel for 20 years. Then 
they  cried  to  the  Lord  and  the  Lord  raised  up  Deborah  as  a  judge  for  
them (4:3, 4).
Women Leaders
Does God appoint women to be the leaders of His people? God’s first 
choice  is  always  a  man  –  as  it  says  in  1  Timothy  2:12–14,  for  two  
reasons. First  of  all,  because  Adam  was  created  first,  and  Eve  was 
created to be a helper for Adam. Secondly, because Eve was deceived 
and sinned first. Therefore the Lord says through Paul there: “I  do  
not allow a woman to exercise authority over the man in the church.” A 
woman can lead and teach the children in a Sunday-school class, and 
women in women’s classes. She can also teach her children at home. 
But she cannot be an elder in the church. That is the perfect will of 
God.  In  Isaiah,  God  says  that  things  are  indeed  in  a  pathetic  state,  
when His people are led by women (Isaiah 3:12).
But what should God do when He finds that all the men in Israel (or in a 
church) are lazy, sluggish and cowardly! Then God raises up a “Deborah”. 
And through the years, He has raised up many “Deborahs” in Christendom 
to be His servants – and I want to praise God for every single one of them. 
God  has  used  women  mightily  as  missionaries  and  as  writers  to  save  
souls and to build the body of Christ. When God cannot find a man, He 
will use a woman – in any ministry. That is what we learn from Deborah. 
The promise in the new covenant age is: “I will pour out My Spirit on 
your sons and your daughters and on My bondslaves – both men and 
women – and they will (both) prophesy” (Acts 2:17, 18). Philip had four 
unmarried  daughters  –  all of  whom  took  advantage  of  that  promise  of  
God and prophesied (Acts 21:9). 
Even though women are not called to be elders or to teach, they can 
still prophesy (“build up, encourage and comfort” – 1 Corinthians 14:3) 
and speak forth God’s word to build up the church 1 Corinthians 11:5 
is very clear on that.

148 Through the Bible: Backsliding and Deliverance
Judges
Deborah was a prophetess (4:4). There are no prophetesses under the 
new covenant. But there were under the old covenant. Deborah was the 
wife of Lappidoth. He didn’t hinder his wife from being a judge. He sat 
beside her with a meek and quiet spirit and encouraged her in her minis-
try! Perhaps he helped to look after the children at home. God could not 
use Brother Lappidoth, but He could use his wife.
In the Acts of the Apostles, we read of a couple – Aquila and Priscilla. 
It appears as though Priscilla knew God and the Scriptures better than 
her  husband  Aquila.  I  say  that  because  in  the  five times that  they  are  
referred  to  together  in  the  New  Testament,  four  times  they  are  referred  
to  as  “Priscilla and  Aquila”,  and  not  as  “Aquila  and  Priscilla”  (Acts 
18:18,  26; Romans  16:3; 2  Timothy  4:19)! The order there has signifi-
cance. It is a plain fact that there are many wives who know God and the 
Scriptures better than their husbands. 
Priscilla, however, was a wonderful sister who knew how to submit to 
her husband Aquila. When she heard Apollos once in the synagogue 
and realised that he did not understand the truth fully, she invited him 
home and sat down with her husband and explained the way of God 
to Apollos, and thus revolutionised Apollos’ ministry (Acts 18:24–28). 
She didn’t get up in the synagogue and correct him. No. She called him 
home. That’s a beautiful example of a sister who knew her place as a 
woman, but who had the anointing of God upon her life to bless even 
men. Apollos finally became a co-worker of the apostle Paul. But the 
one who set him on the right path first was a woman – Priscilla!
Deborah  used  to  sit  under  a  palm  tree  and  the  sons  of  Israel  would  
come  to  her  for  judgement  (4:5).  Perhaps  her  husband  Lappidoth  was  
cooking the food at home, while she was judging Israel. God had to do 
it like that, because all the men in Israel were so effeminate. Then she 
called for the bravest man in Israel – Barak – to lead Israel in battle. She 
recognised her limitations and knew that, as a woman, she could not go 
to battle. She needed a man, just like Priscilla needed Aquila. 
Deborah  told  Barak,  “Take  10,000  men  with  you  and  go  and  fight 
against Sisera and the Lord will deliver him into your hand” (4:6, 7). That 
was such a clear and specific prophecy from the Lord. But what does the 
bravest  man  in  Israel  reply.  Barak  said,  “Sister, if  you  come  with  me  
I will go. Please come with me” (4:8). He was scared to go without her! 
So Deborah agreed to go with Barak. How effeminate the bravest man in 
Israel was! And he was typical of all the others. But because Barak was 
so  effeminate,  Deborah  told  him,  “The  honour  of  killing  Sisera  will  not  
come to you. It will go to a woman.” Finally, it was a woman, Jael, who 
killed Sisera (4:22). 
There is a lesson here for all men. God is disappointed when He cannot 
find a man to lead His people. But God’s work will not be hindered just 

Gideon and His Army                                                                                                                               149
Judges
because  the  men  fail  Him.  He  will  use  women  instead.  God  has  used  
many women, through the centuries, all over the world, to do His work. 
God is not limited to men to get His work done.
After Israel was liberated from Sisera, Deborah and Barak sang a song. 
It is called the “Song of Deborah and Barak.” (Chapter 5). In 5:16, we read 
about the different tribes that came to fight in the battle. And then in 5:23, 
we read, “Curse Meroz.” Why does Meroz have to be cursed? Because they 
did nothing. They did not commit any sin, but they did nothing. They did 
not come to the help of the Lord when the enemy was coming.
Maybe  you  have  not  committed  any  sin.  But  if  you  don’t  go  out  to  
spiritual battle, to fight for the Lord, you are sinning. It is a sin to sit back 
and do nothing, when others are fighting the battles of the Lord. That’s 
not a sin of commission. It’s a sin of omission.
There are two types of sins – sins of commission and sins of omission. 
Sins of commission are those where we do something wrong. Sins of 
omission are those where we did nothing, when we should have done 
something.  In  the  parable  of  the  good  Samaritan,  the  priest  and  the  
Levite did nothing. Theirs was the sin of Meroz. When there was a need 
for warriors to fight for the Lord, Meroz did nothing. So when you don’t 
support the Lord’s soldiers and don’t go out yourself and fight, you are 
sinning.
Gideon and His Army
Then they had peace for 40 years (5:31). But the new generation sinned 
like their fathers – and this time the Lord let the Midianites enslave Israel 
for seven years.
Then God raised up Gideon to be the deliverer. The Word of God says, 
“The  Spirit  of  the  Lord  clothed  Gideon”  (6:34  -  margin).  The  Holy  Spirit  
came on Gideon like the clothes he wore. Then Gideon was empowered 
and he blew the trumpet and went out to battle. 32,000 men came out 
to fight along with him. But the Lord said the people were too many 
(7:2). God didn’t want all of them, because they were not wholehearted. 
So Gideon told all those who were afraid to go home. 
That’s what the Lord says to us too: “Are you afraid of the devil? Then go 
home. Are you afraid that somebody will call you ‘Beelzebul’, ‘heretic’, or 
‘false prophet’? Then go home. Don’t waste your time serving the Lord.”
22,000 men went home that day. 10,000 were still left (7:3). God said 
that the people were still too many. They too were not wholehearted. Most 
of them were seeking their own and had to be removed. “Take them down 
to the water and I will test them there,” said the Lord (verse 4). When they 
came to the water, most of them forgot all about the enemy and buried 

150 Through the Bible: Backsliding and Deliverance
Judges
their  heads  in  the  water  and  began  to  drink.  Many  Christians  are  like  
that.  When  they  see  the  attractive  things  in  the  world,  they  forget  all  
about the Lord and His battles and bury their heads in covetous pursuit 
of wealth. 9,700 of Gideon’s soldiers were disqualified that day. 
There  were  only  300  left.  These  men,  when  they  came  to  the  water,  
remained  alert  looking  out  for  the  enemy,  gathered  just  enough  water  
with  their  hands  to  quench  their  immediate  thirst.  These  typify  those  
believers who use money and material things, but are not taken up with 
it. They work at their jobs faithfully to earn their living, but spend the 
rest of their time doing what they can for the Lord. God says, “Those are 
the  people  I  want.”  And  there  were  only  300  left  in  that  army  that  day  
–  less  than  1%  of  the  original  32,000.  The  percentage  is  always  small,  
because the way to life is narrow and few find it. Only 2 out of 600,000 – 
Joshua and Caleb – made it to the promised land. But the Lord is happy 
with those few.
In 7:16,  we  read  that Gideon  divided  his  army  into  three  companies  
of  100  men  each.  Each  man  carried  a  trumpet  and  a  pitcher  with  a  
light inside. They broke the pitcher so that the light showed and then 
they blew their trumpets. This is a picture of how our life and minis-
try should be. We are all earthen pitchers but “we have the treasure 
of  the  glory  of  God  within  our  earthen  vessel”  (2  Corinthians  4:6,  7). 
But  this  earthen  vessel  has  to  be  broken through  many  trials  –  “the 
dying of Jesus” – before the light can be seen by others (2 Corinthians 
4:7–11).  Otherwise,  the  light  will  be  forever  hidden  within  us.  When  
he  wrote  that,  Paul  was  thinking  of  Gideon’s  army  carrying  earthen  
vessels with a light inside which became visible only when the pitchers 
were broken. God seeks to break us through many circumstances, so 
that the light of the life of Christ within us shines forth. Blowing the 
trumpet is a picture of our proclaiming the glory of the Lord and His 
Word unashamedly. God is looking for men and women like that today.
Earlier, before Gideon went to this battle, the Lord had told him, “If you 
want a little more courage, just go down at night to the enemy camp and 
listen to what they are saying” (7:10, 11). And when Gideon went down 
there, he heard that they were all scared of him and his band of people. 
If you go into the camp of the devil today and listen, you will hear that 
they  are  scared  of  Jesus  and  of  those  who  follow  Him.  That  should  
encourage us to go to battle against Satan. The devil is scared of Jesus 
Christ – and he is really scared of us too – if we are true disciples. So let 
us call his bluff, whenever he tries to frighten us.
But even Gideon did not endure in faithfulness to the Lord. This is the 
sad  story  of  many  who  started  well  –  both  under  the  old  covenant  and  
today as well. The Israelites wanted Gideon to rule over them and he said, 
“No,  I  won’t  rule.  Neither  will  my  son  rule.  The  Lord  will  rule”  (8:22,  23). 

Samson and His Failure                                                                                                                            151
Judges
That  sounds  so  spiritual.  But  listen  to  what  he  said  in  his  very  next  
sentence. He said, “Please give me an earring, all of you” (8:24). So all the 
Israelites gave him their earrings and Gideon collected 1700 shekels (about 
20 kilograms) of gold plus a lot of other ornaments and expensive clothing 
(8:26). Gideon became a multi-millionaire in a single day – just like many 
preachers who become millionaires by collecting tithes and offerings from 
their flock and taking it all home! Gideon  used  some  of  the  gold  also  to  
make an ephod that became an idol that Israel worshipped (8:27).
Thus,  this  great  man  backslid.  It  is  the  way  a  man  ends  his  life  that  
matters and not the way he begins it. The prize in every race is for those who 
finish well and not for those who started well (1 Corinthians 9:24). We are 
commanded  to  “consider  how  people  ended  their  lives”  (Hebrews  13:7  -  
margin).  Many  a  preacher  mightily  used  by  God  in  his  early  days  has  
backslid  like  Gideon,  and  ended  his  life  running  after  money  and  prop-
erty! With the anointing lost, they spend their last days collecting gold and 
earrings for their children! Let me say to those of you who have started well: 
Learn a lesson from Gideon, and from these other men, lest the same 
thing happen to you. You cannot serve God and money. What a blessed 
contrast we see in people like Samuel who could say at the end of his 
life, “Whose ox have I taken or whose donkey have I taken? Whom have 
I oppressed?” (1 Samuel 12:3). Like him, Paul could also say at the end 
of his life, “I have coveted no-one’s silver or gold or clothes...nor did we 
eat anyone’s bread without paying for it.... We took advantage of no-one” 
(Acts 20:33; 2 Thessalonians 3:8; 2 Corinthians 7:2). What a testimony 
for a preacher! Follow the example of men like Samuel and Paul.
After that, in Judges, we read of other leaders – Abimelech, Tola, Jair, 
Jephthah, Ibzan, Elon and Abdon.
Jephthah was one who kept his word and offered his daughter to God 
so that she remained unmarried throughout her life, because her father 
made a vow to God (11:35).
Samson and His Failure
Then we come to the 13
th
 judge – Samson. In Chapter 13, we read of the 
family of Manoah that did not have any children. The angel of the Lord 
appeared to Manoah’s wife one day and told her that she would bear a 
son, and that he should be brought up as a Nazirite. Then, Samson was 
born. The Lord blessed him and the Spirit of God began to move upon 
him (13:25). He was anointed – that was the secret of his power. 
But,  unfortunately,  Samson  also  backslid  –  very  early  in  his  life. 
Whenever  he  saw  a  pretty  woman,  he  just  could  not  control  his  lusts.  
He would forget all about his calling to serve the Lord and would go after 
that woman – whether she was a Jew or a Gentile made no difference to 

152 Through the Bible: Backsliding and Deliverance
Judges
him, so long as she was good-looking! This was his weakness throughout 
his life. God used him no doubt; but he had a great weakness for pretty 
women – like many a preacher today. Samson’s behaviour stands in great 
contrast  to  Joseph’s.  Joseph  lived  before  the  Law  was  given  and  had  
much less revelation on God’s ways than Samson had. Yet he stood true 
to God repeatedly – and has therefore become an outstanding example 
for young men for thousands of years. Samson, on the other hand has 
been an equally outstanding warning to all men for thousands of years! 
In 14:5, 6, we read that “Samson went down to Timnah and a young 
lion came roaring towards him and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him 
mightily so that he caught the lion and tore the lion to pieces.” He tore that 
lion to pieces, just like we would tear up a piece of paper. And he was 
so humble that he didn’t tell anyone about it – not even his father and 
mother. Samson knew that it was the power of the Holy Spirit that had 
enabled him to do that.
In 14:10,  we  read  that  his  father  went  down  to  meet  the  Philistine  
woman whom Samson liked and got Samson married to her. This was in 
direct disobedience of God’s Law that had clearly stated that an Israelite 
was never to marry a non-Israelite. Samson’s was an up-and-down life 
– sometimes up but mostly down. We read in 16:1 that he went down to 
Gaza and he saw a harlot there and liked her and committed fornication 
with her. When he was caught, he pulled out the gates of the city and 
walked  off  with  them!  Later,  he  met  another  Philistine  woman  named  
Delilah  and  fell  in  love  with  her  (16:4).  God  must  have  spoken  to  his  
conscience many a time. But he would not listen. He probably rejoiced 
in the fact that God was using him – just like many preachers do today. 
Many will come to the Lord in the last day and remind Him of how He had 
used them in various ministries. But the Lord will cast all of them into 
hell, because they lived in sin in their private lives (Matthew 7:22, 23). 
If we keep on rejecting God’s gentle warnings to our conscience, we too 
can destroy ourselves like those preachers.
Samson finally put his head on Delilah’s lap and revealed the secret 
of his strength to her. She cut off his hair promptly and that was the 
end  of  his  ministry.  What  a  tragedy!  A  man  who  was  such  a  mighty  
deliverer, was enslaved to his own lusts and passions. Paul says in 1 
Corinthians 9:27, “It is possible for me to preach to others and still be 
disqualified myself, if I don’t keep my body in subjection.” The  Living  
Bible paraphrases that verse as, “making my body do what it should 
do, and not what it wants to do.” That means that we are to make our 
bodies  eat  what  it  should  eat  and  not  what  it  wants  to  eat;  sleep  as  
much as it should sleep, and not how much it wants to sleep. We must 
control our eyes so that they look only at what they should look at and 
not at what they want to look at. We must control our tongues so that 
they speak what they should speak and not what they want to speak.

Samson and His Failure                                                                                                                            153
Judges
If  we  don’t  control  our  bodily  passions,  we  may  preach  wonderful  
messages and yet be cast out by the Lord in the final day. So  much  
depends on our disciplining our bodily passions. That is the message we 
get from the story of Samson who had a wonderful ministry that blessed 
so many people. But finally he himself was disqualified. So many great 
preachers have fallen a prey to pretty women. Don’t be impressed by the 
gifts that such men exercise or by the vastness of their organisations!! 
A  leader  falling  into  sin  is  a  far  more  serious  thing  than  an  ordinary  
believer falling into the same sin – as we saw in Leviticus. To whom more 
is given, from them more is required as well.
If you are not faithful in your relationship with the opposite sex, don’t 
dishonour  God’s  name  by  trying  to  be  an  elder  or  a  leader.  Don’t  fool  
the people that you are a holy man of God, when you are living in sin. 
God  will  expose  you  publicly  one  day,  if  you  continue  to  live  like  that.  
You may think you are clever enough to hide your sin. But you are not 
clever enough for God. He will expose you more than you have ever been 
exposed thus far.
In Chapter 16, we read of how Samson lost his power and how his eyes 
were blinded. When preachers go after women, this is what happens: They 
lose  their  spiritual  vision.  They  cannot  see  clearly  any  more.  They  may  
still  be  evangelical  in  their  doctrines  and  be  able  to  preach  eloquently.  
But their spiritual vision would have gone. 
Samson  became  a  slave.  But  praise  God,  he  had  enough  sense  to  
acknowledge his sin toward the end of his life. He repented and finally 
destroyed many Philistines in his death (Judge 16:23–31).
Samson’s story is the story of two lions – one on the outside and one 
inside  his  heart.  He  could  overpower  the  external  lion,  but  he  could  
not  conquer  the  internal one.  This  teaches  us  that  the  lion  of  sexual  
lust is far stronger and more to be feared than any external lion. What 
would you do if you saw a lion running towards you in a forest? You 
would  turn  around  and  run.  Do  you  do  the  same  when  you  see  the  
lion of lust coming at you? The Bible exhorts us to “flee from immoral-
ity” (1 Corinthians 6:18). That is the only way to overcome it – don’t go 
anywhere near such temptation. Don’t go anywhere near a woman who 
tempts you. Avoid flirtatious women like you would avoid hungry lions.
Samson lived under the old covenant. So no-one can make Samson’s 
example  his  excuse  for  falling  into  immorality  today.  Samson  did  not  
have  the  New  Testament,  he  lived  prior  to  Calvary’s  cross,  he  had  no  
Example as we have in Jesus today, and above all, he could not receive 
the Holy Spirit as an Indwelling Helper as we can. The way into the most 
holy place of fellowship with the Father was not yet open in those days. 
Samson did not have the blessing of godly fellowship either. All of these 
we have today. So we have no excuse for living in sin.

154 Through the Bible: Backsliding and Deliverance
Judges
Whatever was Right in Their Eyes
In Chapters 17 to 21, we read about the idolatry, the immorality and the 
wars  among  the  Israelites,  which  reveal  the  degraded  state  of  a  nation  
that God had chosen to be His representatives on earth. They had sunk 
as low as Sodom and Gomorrah.
In 17:7–13, we see the first case of a paid professional preacher in the 
Bible, who was willing to go wherever he got the best salary and the best 
benefits. Here was a Levite who agreed to serve as a priest to the highest 
bidder. A businessman came along and offered him a good salary, a new 
set of clothes every year, and free housing and boarding. The preacher 
signed the contract immediately! The businessman who paid him thought 
that God would now bless him because he had employed a preacher who 
had graduated from the school of the Levites!! How very like what we see 
happening today. One would almost think that that was a 21
st
-century 
story! The  reason  for  this  pathetic  state  of  affairs  is  given  in  the  verse  
immediately preceding the  description  of  this  incident,  “Every  man  did  
what was right in his own eyes” (17:6).
And that verse about sums up everything that happened in Israel in the 
days of the judges. And so this statement is, very appropriately, repeated 
as the last verse of the book, “In those days there was no king in Israel. 
Everyone did what was right in his own eyes” (21:25). 
That was how the Israelites lived in those days. And that is how many 
Christians  live  today.  Jesus  is  not  King  in  their  lives  and  so  they  do 
whatever they feel like. They spend their money as they feel like and they 
live as they feel like. The preachers go wherever they can get the largest 
salary. They all live without any reference to the will of God or the perfect 
plan of God for their lives. 
God has given us Jesus Christ now as our Example. If we don’t follow 
Him as our Lord and our King, we too can end up like those Israelites 
described in the book of Judges.

RUTH
God’s Sovereign Choice
T
he  book  of  Ruth  is  an  interesting  story,  because  it  deals  with  a  
woman who was a Moabitess’. Ruth was not a Jew. Moab, as we 
have  already  seen,  was  one  of  the  sons  of  Lot,  born  through  his  
committing adultery with his own daughter. From this incestuous rela-
tionship came a race called the Moabites. Among these Moabites was a 
young girl named Ruth. She had a very bad heritage. Yet, she became the 
great grandmother of King David, and thus in the ancestral line of Jesus 
Christ. We see here God’s love for children born out of fornication and 
incestuous relationships.
Some of you may have a bad family heritage or lived a very wicked life 
yourselves in the past. Maybe your mother was not married when you 
were born. Or she may have been a prostitute. Or you may have been 
born  out  of  an  incestuous  relationship.  It  doesn’t  matter.  Men  may  
reject you and despise you, but not God. You can still be a saint. That’s 
the encouragement we get from the book of Ruth. God did not condemn 
her because she came from a certain race either. 
God  had  given  the  Israelites  a  law  that  said,  “No  Moabite  shall  enter  
the assembly of the Lord; none of their descendants even to the tenth 
generation,  shall  ever  enter  the  assembly  of  the  Lord”  (Deuteronomy 
23:3).  Yet  God  bypassed  that  law  when  it  came  to  Ruth.  God  looked  
at her heart and saw that she sincerely sought for Him – and so God 
accepted her. God has every right to bypass His ceremonial laws when 
He sees a sincere heart – and He did. Ruth’s great grandson, David, 
became a man after God’s own heart. And the fourth generation from 
this Moabitess woman – Solomon – far from being denied entry into the 
temple of the Lord, actually built that temple!

Ruth
The Choice Ruth Made
The story of Ruth’s marriage is an interesting one. There was a famine in 
Israel and so Elimelech and his wife Naomi went into the land of Moab 
along  with  their  two  sons.  These  sons  grew  up  and  married  Moabite  
women, violating God’s laws. Then Elimelech died and the two sons also 
died. Naomi, being a kind lady, then told her two daughters-in-law, Ruth 
and Orpah, to go back to their own land and find new husbands (1:8).
Both Ruth and Orpah wept aloud when they heard this (1:9, 14). Orpah 
then  kissed  her  mother-in-law  and  said,  “Goodbye,  Mum.  I  must  go  back  
home and find another husband. I have to take care of my own life.” But Ruth 
clung to Naomi. She had learnt something about the true God from Naomi, 
and she wanted to worship and serve this God, more than she wanted a 
husband. Orpah, however, wanted a husband. There was a fork in the road 
there and Orpah took the wrong road. Ruth took the right turning – and 
that made all the difference, for all eternity. We never hear of Orpah again. 
Wherever she is today, she is undoubtedly regretting her choice.
We also come to forks in the road many a time. You may hear a message 
that shows you two ways in front of you. Some of you may be facing 
that choice right now. Forks in the road are important places, because 
you are compelled to take a decision. Ruth told Naomi, “Please don’t 
tell me to go back. I will go with you. I will stay with you. Your people 
will henceforth be my people and your God will be my God” (verse 16). 
She took a firm decision that day. And today, in the presence of God, 
she has no regret.
When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined, she agreed to let her accom-
pany her back to Israel (1:18). Thus they came to Elimelech’s hometown 
of Bethlehem. And Naomi said, “I went out full, but the Lord has brought 
me back empty.” If only Naomi knew what lay ahead of her! Sometimes we 
complain like Naomi that the Lord has brought us back empty, or that the 
Lord is against us, or that the Lord Almighty has afflicted us! (verse 21). 
How  foolish  it  was  of  Naomi  to  complain  about  God  like  that!  But  even  
though  her  mother-in-law  was  foolish,  Ruth  herself  did  not  complain.  
She was thankful that she had found the true God. She was a very good 
daughter-in-law and took care of her mother-in-law. People saw this. And 
God saw it too. God saw this heathen girl not complaining and having a 
humble spirit of service. Many times, those who come out of heathenism 
to  Christ  are  much  better  believers  than  those  who  are  born  in  believ-
ers’  families.  This  girl  Ruth,  who  came  from  a  heathen  background  is  
a  challenge  to  all  of  us.  She  had  none  of  the  usual  attitude  of  worldly  
daughters-in-law  to  their  mothers-in-law.  She  loved  her  mother-in-law  
and looked after her very well. This was why God rewarded her.

The Field of Boaz                                                                                                                                       157
Ruth
The Field of Boaz
Now  Naomi  had  a  close  relative,  a  man  of  great  wealth,  by  the  name  
of Boaz (2:1). There was a law in Israel that if a married man died, his 
closest  relative  must  marry  his  widow  and  raise  children  in  the  dead  
man’s name (Deuteronomy 25:5–9). So Naomi thought, “Well, Boaz is a 
close relative of mine and he is still single. Perhaps he can marry Ruth.” 
But Ruth didn’t know that law (being a Moabitess) and Naomi never 
told  her,  lest  her  hopes  be  raised.  Ruth  in  any  case,  was  not  inter-
ested in getting married again. She did not come to Israel to look for a 
husband. She came in search of the true God. It was Orpah who went 
to Moab looking for a husband. But because Ruth sought God first, 
she not only found God, but found a good husband and a good herit-
age for the future as well. God honours those who honour Him. Those 
who seek God’s kingdom first, find that God adds all the other things 
necessary  for  life  on  earth,  automatically,  without  their  ever  seeking  
for them. Such things fall into their lap.
Naomi and Ruth were poor; but Ruth was a hard-working girl who was 
not  ashamed  to  do  lowly  jobs  to  earn  her  daily  bread.  So  she  told  her  
mother-in-law one day that she would go and pick up the leftovers of the 
grain from the grainfields of the rich people. Now, there was a law that 
God  had  made  in  Israel  that  when  people  glean  their  grain,  they  must  
leave out the corners of their fields, and should not go over their fields a 
second time to pick up what was left over – but must leave such grains 
for  the  poor  (Leviticus  19:9,  10).  Ruth  went  to  pick  up  such  left-over  
grain. Being a poor girl, she wanted to do what she could to take care of 
herself and her mother-in-law.
The sovereignty of God led her amazingly to the field of Boaz. It is 
wonderful  to  see  how  God,  in  His  sovereignty,  brought  together  these  
two, whom He had planned from all eternity, to unite as husband and 
wife.  Boaz  saw  this  woman  gleaning  there  and  asked  the  workers  who  
she was. They replied that she was the Moabite woman who had come 
back with Naomi. Boaz was a very kind and godly man. He was concerned 
that Ruth should not be molested by any of the men, and so he told her 
not to go and glean in any other field, since that would be dangerous. 
He told his servants not to harm her in any way. Ruth was so touched 
by this that she fell on her face and asked why he was being so kind to a 
despised Moabitess. Boaz replied that he had heard about all the kind-
ness she had shown to her mother-in-law and also how she had chosen 
to follow the Lord, having forsaken her old Moabite idols. Boaz then told 
his  workers  to  drop  some  handfuls  of  grain  on  purpose  so  that  Ruth  
could pick them up.

158 Through the Bible: God’s Sovereign Choice
Ruth
Why God Chose Ruth
Why did God pick such a girl to be the wife of Boaz and the ancestor of 
David and in the genealogical line of our Lord? First of all, because Ruth 
was a very humble girl who did not think too highly of herself. She was 
also hard-working and gracious, a woman of steadfast faith, who had 
forsaken her home and her relatives in order to follow the Lord, and 
one  who  treated  her  mother-in-law  with  respect,  kindness  and  love.  
These are the qualities that God looks for even today in young girls.
When Ruth came home, her mother-in-law asked her where she had 
gleaned, and she told her. When Naomi heard that, she told Ruth that 
she would try and find some security for her and told her that Boaz was 
a close relative. She must have explained to Ruth about God’s law that 
commanded  a  close  relative  to  redeem  the  property  of  a  widow  and  to  
marry her. 
So when Boaz met her, she requested him to redeem her and marry 
her, since he was a close relative (3:9). Boaz was glad to see that Ruth 
did not choose the more handsome, younger men who were there. Boaz 
was a much older man, and young girls are not usually attracted to older 
men.  But  he  told  her  that  there  was  another  relative  even  closer  than  
him. Being a righteous man, Boaz said that he would have to ask that 
man first whether he would redeem and marry her (3:12, 13).
The Kinsman Redeemer
The next day, Boaz promptly went to the gate and asked this other rela-
tive whether he would redeem Naomi’s property, as her closest relative 
(4:3, 4). He promptly said, “Yes, I will redeem it.” But Boaz reminded him 
that he would also have to marry Ruth and raise up sons in the name of 
her dead husband. When he heard this, he withdrew his offer and said 
he  could  not  do  that,  since  her  sons  would  later  claim  an  inheritance  
along with his sons, and he didn’t want that complication! So he refused 
to redeem the property. Thus Boaz became first in line to redeem the 
property and to marry Ruth. He readily agreed to do that.
That was a bold step for a prominent man like Boaz to take – to marry 
a  Moabite  girl.  But  he  had  seen  some  outstanding  qualities  in  Ruth  
and respected her for having come out of her heathen family. Christian 
boys often hesitate to marry girls who have been saved from non-Chris-
tian families. But in most cases, such girls are stronger Christians and 
more godly than those born in believing families. 
Boaz married Ruth and they had a son called Obed who became the 
father of Jesse who became the father of David (4:17).

The Kinsman Redeemer                                                                                                                           159
Ruth
Thus  God  honoured  a  woman  from  an  incestuous,  heathen  back-
ground,  because  she  honoured  God.  What  we  learn  in  Ruth  is  the  
truth of 1 Samuel 2:30, “Those who honour Me I will honour.” There is 
no partiality with God. 
This story shows how God cares for His children who may be despised 
by others, to find good marriage-partners for them. So we can trust the 
Lord  even  for  such  earthly  matters.  God  cares  for  us  and  He  wants  to  
meet all our earthly needs – whatever they may be.
This story is also a beautiful picture of our spiritual union with Christ. 
Ruth  is  a  perfect  type  of  what  we  are  in  our  sinful  state.  And  Jesus  
Christ had to become our “near relative”, before He could redeem us 
and marry us. This is why He took flesh and blood like us and was made 
“in all things like us His brothers” (Hebrews 2:17). Thus He became our 
Kinsman-Redeemer. It was God Who planned the union between Ruth 
and Boaz. And it was God Who planned the union between Christ and 
us, before the foundation of the world!
Hallelujah!



1 SAMUEL
The Last Judge and the First King
S
amuel was primarily a prophet – the first of Israel’s great proph-
ets in Canaan. He was also a priest and a judge – the last judge of 
Israel. He lived at about the same time as Samson, but in another 
part of Israel.
*
The Birth of Samuel 
The story of Samuel begins with his mother, Hannah, being barren. It’s 
interesting to see how many women are mentioned in Scripture as having 
been  barren  for  many  years  before  having  children  –  Sarah,  Rebekah,  
Rachel  and  Hannah.  They  all  sought  God  in  prayer,  and  each  of  them  
gave birth to a son who had a unique place in God’s purpose. They did 
not accept their barrenness. They prayed to God earnestly for children. 
God granted them their request and each of them had a child through 
whom God fulfilled a unique purpose. Many mothers pray for their child-
ren  while  they  are  still  in  their  wombs.  But  these  women  prayed  with  
an unusual intensity. It’s wonderful when a child is born into the world 
through intense prayer like that. That is how Samuel was born.
Hannah had prayed to the Lord for many years for a child. Finally, she 
made  a  vow  saying,  “Lord, If You will indeed look on the affliction of Your 
maidservant  and  remember  me,  and  not  forget  Your  maidservant,  but  will  
give me a son, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life” (1:11). 
There was a shift in her focus now. At first, she thought only of her own 
need: “I need a son.” Then she began to say, “If I have a son, I’ll give him to 
the Lord, since the Lord has a need as well.” When the focus of our prayer 
shifts from our need to God’s need, that’s when we begin to get answers to 
our prayers. The Lord taught us to pray, “Hallowed be Thy name” first of all.

   The timeline of the prophets is given on p. 178.

162 Through the Bible: The Last Judge and the First King
1 Samuel
There was great spiritual need in Israel at that time. God’s people had 
backslidden  so  badly.  Their  leaders  like  Eli,  were  terribly  backslidden  
too. Israel had never had a prophet since the days of Moses. Hannah was 
a person who was alert to her surroundings. And she would have recog-
nised Israel’s need for a prophet. So Hannah continued to pray, “Lord, 
not  only  will  I  dedicate  my  son  to  You,  but  a  razor  also  will  never  come  
upon his head. He will be a Nazirite, dedicated to You. If You can use him 
to restore this nation back to You, he is Yours.” Her whole prayer shifted 
from her need to God’s. Very often our prayers are not answered, because 
they are focused so much on ourselves. It’s wonderful that Samuel was 
born to such a mother.
When Hannah gave birth to Samuel, she did not forget her promise. 
She brought her son to the temple and said, “For this boy I prayed. The 
Lord has given me my petition which I asked of Him. So I have also dedi-
cated  him  to  the  Lord.  As  long  as  he  lives  he  is  dedicated  to  the  Lord” 
(1:27, 28). She was never going to take him back. She taught that little 
boy to kneel down and worship the Lord there. It’s wonderful to have a 
godly mother like that. Then she sang a wonderful song of thanksgiving 
to the Lord (2:1–10). It is more than likely that Mary’s song of thanks-
giving (Luke 1:46–55) was inspired by Hannah’s song – for the words are 
so similar.
Samuel  grew  up  to  be  a  young  man  who  changed  the  face  of  Israel  
through  his  prophetic  ministry  –  from  the  chaotic  state  we  saw  in  the  
book of Judges, to the glorious state under the reign of David.
Listening to God
The  high-priest  Eli’s  sons  were  worthless,  godless  men,  who  had  no  
fear  of  God  (2:12).  It  is  very  sad  when  a  leader’s  children  are  immoral  
and  godless.  The  worst  part  was  that  Eli  permitted  them  to  take  part  
in  the  ministry  in  the  tabernacle. They would steal from the sacrifices 
and commit adultery with the women in the temple. And what was Eli’s 
response to all this? He should have called them and told them to get out 
of the Lord’s work immediately. Instead, he told them, “My sons, this is 
not good what I hear” (verse 24). He was a spineless and useless leader.
In contrast to those godless men, Samuel grew up “in favour both with 
the Lord and with men” (2:26).
God then sent a messenger to Eli and told him that his ministry was 
finished because he had honoured his sons more than he honoured God 
(2:27–29).  Then  we  find  these  beautiful  words  that  God  spoke  –  that 
we  should  remember  all  through  our  life:  “Those  who  honour  Me  I  will  
honour,  and  those  who  despise  Me  will  be  lightly  esteemed”  (1  Samuel  
2:30). If you honour God, you can be certain that He will honour you. 

Samuel as a Prophet                                                                                                                                 163
1 Samuel
In the midst of these godless surroundings, Samuel grew up pure. That 
is an example for all young people who find themselves in godless homes 
or surroundings. You may be in a church that is full of compromise; but 
don’t allow yourself to be influenced by that. If you can be like Samuel, 
steadfast in your devotion to the Lord, without being corrupted, God can 
raise you up to be His voice in that situation, just as Samuel was.
One  night,  when  Samuel  was  asleep,  he  heard  a  voice  calling  him,  
“Samuel, Samuel.” He thought it was Eli and went to find out. But it 
wasn’t. The voice kept calling Samuel, until Eli told Samuel to ask the 
Lord to speak to him. “Then the Lord came and stood and called as at 
other times, ‘Samuel, Samuel.’ And Samuel said, ‘Speak for Thy servant 
is listening’ ” (3:10). Here is an attitude that all of us must have, through-
out the day, to the Lord’s voice: “Speak Lord, Your servant is listening.” 
God did not give Samuel a warning saying, “Tonight at midnight I am 
going to come and speak to you.” No. Samuel had to be alert at all times. 
In the Scripture, we see again and again that God would suddenly call 
His  prophets  and  speak  to  them.  Then  for  two  or  three  months  they  
would hear nothing. Then again God would speak. So they had to be in 
a state of alertness at all times. But God speaks only to those who are 
eager to hear His voice. Your life and ministry can be totally changed if 
you develop the habit of listening to God, at least from now onwards. 
God may speak to you in the middle of the night, or He may speak to 
you  while  you  are  reading  His  Word  or  while  you  are  travelling  in  the  
bus. He may speak to you through a brother or sister. He may speak to 
you when you are in the midst of others or when you are alone. There 
are many ways in which God speaks. But we must always have a listen-
ing attitude: “Speak Lord, Your servant is listening.” That’s what enabled 
Samuel to grow up to be a prophet of God. When he listened, he could 
tell others what God told him. 
God told Samuel that day, “I am going to judge Eli for his sin.” In the 
morning when Eli called Samuel and asked him, “What did the Lord say 
to you?” Samuel told him everything (3:18). Even though it was bad news 
for Eli, Samuel told him everything. A servant of God must be like that. 
Even though Eli had been very kind to Samuel, Samuel did not hesitate 
to tell him, “God said he was going to judge you. Your sons have brought 
a curse upon themselves, and you did not rebuke them.” 
Samuel as a Prophet
Chapter  3:19  is  a  wonderful  verse  and  a  great  challenge  for  all  those  
who  minister  the  word:  “Samuel  grew  and  the  Lord  did  not  allow  any  
of his words to fall to the ground.” Isn’t it wonderful to be able to speak 
God’s  Word  in  such  a  way  that  not  one  word  we  speak  falls  wasted  to  

164 Through the Bible: The Last Judge and the First King
1 Samuel
the ground, but every single word goes straight home to people’s hearts? 
This should be our aim – not only when ministering the word, but also in 
private conversation. The secret of this was: The Lord was with Samuel. 
We saw in Genesis that this was the secret of Joseph’s effectiveness as 
well: The Lord was with him. We must all yearn for such speech both in 
our ministry and in our conversation. Thus all Israel recognised Samuel 
as a prophet of the Lord (verse 20).
This happened at a time “when word from the Lord was rare and visions 
were  infrequent”  (3:1).  Israel  never  had  a  prophet  for  over  300  years,  
since the days of Moses. Throughout the period of judges there were no 
prophets. The words in Psalm 74:9 “There is no longer any prophet” (when 
read in the context of that psalm) seem to indicate that when God does 
not send  a  prophet  to  his  people,  that  indicates  that  God  has  given  up  
on them.
For over 3 centuries, there was no prophet who came forth with a word 
from the Lord for Israel. But at last Israel knew God had finally raised up 
a young man – and they listened to him. All of you young people should be 
encouraged by this: Samuel was a young man when he started to proph-
esy. So were Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Zechariah (Jeremiah 1:6; Ezekiel 1:1; 
Zechariah 2:4). You don’t have to wait till you are 40 years old to serve the 
Lord. Samuel started serving the Lord when he was 10 years old. By the 
time he was 20, he was a prophet. What was his secret? He was listening. 
His attitude was always, “Speak Lord, Your servant is listening.”
Chapter 4:3: We read here of a time when the Israelites were fighting the 
Philistines and they were defeated. The elders asked themselves, “Why 
has the Lord allowed us to be defeated today? It must be because we 
have not brought the ark of the covenant here.” They didn’t realise that 
they were defeated because of their sins. The ark was only a symbol. 
They could have the symbol without God – just like breaking of bread 
today is a symbol. You can break the bread and drink the cup and yet 
not have fellowship with the Lord. So they brought the ark down into 
their midst. When the ark came, they shouted so loudly that the earth 
beneath  them  began  to  shake  (verse  5).  Many  Christians  even  today  
imagine that it is only when they shout that God is in their midst. 
What  happened?  Before  the  ark  came,  the  Philistines  had  killed  
4000 Israelites in battle (verse 2). After the ark came and Israel had 
shouted,  “Hallelujah,  Praise  the  Lord”,  the  Philistines  killed  30,000  
Israelites (verse 10)!!
There  is  something  we  can  learn  from  this:  You  can’t  bring  God  into  
a  situation  by  bringing  the  symbols  and  the  rituals  or  by  shouting  and  
praising Him. There are many churches where there are both symbols and 
shouting. But the people therein are all defeated by sin. And very often, 
the ones who shout the most are defeated the most as well – just as above!!

Samuel’s Failure as a Father                                                                                                                    165
1 Samuel
God’s  presence  is  found  in  churches  that  are  free  from  sin,  not  in  
churches  that  shout  and  scream  the  loudest.  God  looks  for  people  
who  have  a  clean  conscience,  who  do  not  worship  the  gods  of  plea-
sure,  money  and  entertainment.  Only  then  does  their  shouting  and  
praising Him become meaningful. Wherever God is, there is victory – 
whether with shouting, emotional stirring and physical manifestations 
or without these. But if these latter things alone are present and the 
people are defeated by sin – then God is certainly not in their midst. 
Understanding this simple truth will save us from a lot of deception in 
these last days.
Samuel’s Failure as a Father
Chapter 7:15–17: Samuel used to go annually on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal 
and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places. But he was travelling so 
much that he did not have much time for his family. What was the result? 
His sons went astray. But Samuel still appointed them to take over from 
him  as  judges  in  Israel.  His  sons  began  to  take  bribes  and  to  pervert  
justice  and  made  money  for  themselves  (8:1–3).  That  was  the  biggest  
mistake that Samuel made in his life. He should not have appointed his 
sons as judges, when God had never called them to this ministry.
Many  preachers  make  the  same  mistake  today,  of  appointing  their  
sons to be their successors. Partiality and love for our sons can deafen 
our ears so that we don’t hear God any more. We can stop listening to 
God, when it concerns our own family members. Even such a godly man 
like  Samuel  became  deaf  at  that  point.  As  a  young  man,  Samuel  had  
preached to Eli how to bring up his children. Now we see him failing in 
his own house, in the way he brought up his own children. And when 
he saw that his children were not following the Lord, he should not have 
appointed  them  as  judges  over  God’s  people.  He  was  a  prophet  and  a  
judge and a man of discernment. He had listened to God from childhood. 
But when it came to his own sons, he stopped listening to God. Did he 
ask the Lord, “Whom shall I appoint as the next judges for Your people, 
Lord? Speak Lord, Your servant is listening.” Did God tell him to appoint 
his sons as judges? No. He was so self-confident that he followed his own 
partial  reasoning  and  appointed  his  own  sons.  And  thus  he  destroyed  
many people’s lives.
This  is  what  has  happened  to  many  Christian  leaders,  who  started  
out so well when they were young. But as they grew older, they stopped 
listening  to  what  God  was  saying,  because  they  were  partial  towards  
their own children – even though their children were ungodly.
That’s a warning for all of us. We don’t have to judge anybody else. But 
we certainly can judge ourselves and learn a lot from that. Here is a 
question for those who are in a preaching ministry: Are you so busy 

166 Through the Bible: The Last Judge and the First King
1 Samuel
in  your  ministry  that  you  don’t  have  time  to  bring  up  your  children  
in God’s ways? There are many servants of God today whose children 
are not following in the ways of the Lord. Don’t judge them. You may 
know nothing of the pressures under which those servants of the Lord 
are living and working. You know nothing of how much they and their 
families are the targets of Satan’s attacks. I would never judge them. 
If you want to do something for them, I would say, “Pray for them”. If 
you don’t pray for them, at least don’t judge them. But take a warning 
from them for yourself.
1  Timothy  3:5  is  clear  that  a  man  who  cannot  control  his  children  
(when they are living with him in his home), will not be able to control 
God’s children in His house, and therefore should not be appointed as 
an elder in any church. Such a person should not preach God’s word to 
others either. For if he cannot run his own home properly, how can he 
teach others? Once his children have grown up and left home, they have 
to make their own choice as to whether they will follow the Lord or not. 
Their condition thereafter will not disqualify him from serving the Lord. 
But when his children are at home, their good conduct there is a funda-
mental requirement for his being an elder in the church.
Praying for Others
But that was perhaps the only area where Samuel failed. In many other 
areas, he was an outstanding example of a man who never wavered from 
God’s ways from childhood to the end of his life. Samuel’s sensitivity to 
sin was so great in his own life that he felt that if God had appointed him 
as the leader for the people and he didn’t pray for them he would have 
sinned  (1  Samuel  12:23:  “As  for  me,  far  be  it  from  me  that  I  should  sin  
against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you”). 
How  many  Christian  leaders  believe  that  they  are  committing  
a sin if they don’t pray for their flock? Many like to be leaders. But 
do you realise that if you become a leader and you don’t pray for those 
people, you commit sin?
We know that murder, adultery, bad thoughts and anger are sins. Here 
is one more sin to add to your list: Not praying for those whom you lead. 
Jesus  prayed  for  His  12  disciples  regularly.  Samuel  understood  that  
too. He was a man of prayer. All of God’s great servants have been men 
of prayer. See what God Himself tells Jeremiah 400 years later concern-
ing  Samuel.  Concerning  backslidden  Israel,  God  said,  “Even  if  Moses  
and Samuel stand before Me and pray for these people, I will not change 
my  mind.”  (Jeremiah  15:1).  Doesn’t  God  listen  to  everybody’s  prayer?  
He  certainly  does.  But  “the  effective,  fervent  prayer  of  a  righteous  man  

King Saul – A Man Who Started Well                                                                                                    167
1 Samuel
avails  much.”  (James  5:16).  From  among  all  the  Israelites  that  lived  
during the 800 year period from Moses to Jeremiah, God picked just two 
men who were great men of prayer – Moses and Samuel. The two greatest 
prophets may have been Moses and Elijah. But the two greatest people of 
prayer were Moses and Samuel.
Moses also had two sons, just like Samuel. But Moses did not make the 
mistake of appointing his sons to take over from him. He listened to the 
Lord and appointed the one whom the Lord told him to appoint – Joshua. 
We  see  that  even  a  mighty  man  of  prayer  like  Samuel  could  fail  to  
hear God and make a serious mistake. Partiality and love for our flesh 
and blood are both very close to us. That was why Jesus said that we 
had  to  cut  off  our  attachment  to  our  parents,  wife  and  other  family  
members, if we wanted to be His disciples (Luke 14:26). A wise man will 
learn from the mistakes of others. A foolish man will make the same 
mistakes himself. We find multitudes of Christians making the same 
mistakes that Scripture warns us of again and again.
King Saul – A Man Who Started Well
Now we come to the ministry of Saul. We see Saul initially, as a humble, 
young man who had no interest in becoming king. The people of Israel 
wanted a king. And one day, the Lord told Samuel: “Tomorrow about this 
time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint 
him to be king over My people Israel ” (1 Samuel 9:15–17). When Samuel 
saw Saul, the Lord said to him, “Behold, this is the man.” Samuel spoke 
to Saul and “took a flask of oil, poured it on his head and said, ‘The Lord 
has anointed you a ruler over His inheritance’ ” (1 Samuel 10:1). Saul was 
absolutely surprised, for he did not expect this at all. He was, after all, 
just an ordinary man.
But for God to pick him out would indicate that God had seen many 
good qualities in him. And so Samuel told him, “The Spirit of the Lord will 
come upon you mightily, you will prophesy, and you will be changed into 
another man” (10:6).
This is indeed a wonderful word that describes what happens to a man 
when he is filled with the Holy Spirit: He is changed into another man. 
This is what all of us need to experience continually.
But  Saul  had  to  be  recognised  by  the  people  also  as  the  man  whom  
God had chosen to be their king. So Samuel called all the people together 
and  told  them  that  a  king  would  be  selected  by  God  from  their  midst.  
Samuel did not name Saul. Instead he cast lots – by tribes first, then by 
families  and  then  by  individual  names  –  believing  that  the  Lord  would  
sovereignly control the lot. The lot finally fell on Saul. But when they 
looked for Saul, they couldn’t find him because he had disappeared. He 
had hidden himself, because he did not want to become the king. 

168 Through the Bible: The Last Judge and the First King
1 Samuel
Notice ten good qualities that Saul had.
1. He was faithful and thorough in his work. In Chapter 9:3, we read that 
his father Kish had lost his donkeys. Kish told Saul to go and search 
for  them.  Saul  conducted  a  thorough  search  in  all  the  hill  country  
of  Ephraim  and  the  land  of  Shalishah.  His  father  had  given  him  a  
job  to  do,  and  he  did  it  thoroughly.  He  didn’t  just  go  looking  for  the  
donkeys for a few minutes and come back saying, “I can’t find them.” 
God picks up people who are faithful in small matters like looking for 
lost donkeys!
2. He was wise. When a long time had elapsed and he still hadn’t found 
any  of  the  donkeys,  he  told  his  servant,  “Let’s  go  back  because  my  
father will now be more concerned about us than the donkeys.” (9:5).
3. He knew how to respect God’s servants. When his servant suggested 
that they go and meet a servant of God in the city, Saul said, “Let’s 
take a present for him” (9:7).
4. He had a humble opinion about himself. When Samuel told Saul about 
God having chosen him, he replied, “Who am I? Am I not a Benjamite, 
of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the 
families of the tribe of Benjamin?” (9:21).
5. He did not boast. When his uncle asked him what Samuel had said, 
Saul  told  his  uncle  that  Samuel  said  his  donkeys  had  been  found,  
but  he  did  not  tell  his  uncle  about  Samuel  anointing  him  as  king  
(10:15,16).
6. He stayed in the background. When they selected him to be the king, 
he hid himself in the baggage. He was a man who wanted to be hidden 
(10:22).
7. He was longsuffering. When Saul went to his house, certain worth-
less men said, “How can this man deliver us?” They despised him and 
did  not  bring  any  present.  But  he  kept  silent  even  though  he  was  
publicly anointed as king (10:27).
8. He was zealous to help those in need. When certain people of Israel 
were attacked by their enemies, they sent messengers to Saul, who 
immediately gathered people to go and help them (11:1–7).
9. He  was  courageous.  Saul  went  and  fought  the  Ammonite  enemies  
courageously and saved the Israelites (11:11).
10. He  forgave  his  enemies.  When  Saul  came  back  victorious  from  the  
battle, some people wanted to kill those who had earlier rejected Saul 
as king. But he would not allow anyone to be killed (11:12, 13).
This was the man God chose, who had all these wonderful qualities. Yet 
in a few years he had lost his contact with God, lost the anointing of the 
Spirit,  lost  his  humility,  lost  his  character,  lost  his  kingdom  and  lost  
everything. This is the sad story of many servants of God today too, who 
started out well. 

Why Saul Failed                                                                                                                                         169
1 Samuel
Why Saul Failed
In Chapter13:8, we see the first reason why Saul lost his kingdom. Samuel 
had told Saul to wait for him and he would offer a sacrifice to the Lord, 
before Saul went into battle. Saul waited for 7 days and Samuel didn’t 
come. So Saul decided to offer the sacrifice himself (13:9). He knew that 
he was not a priest, and that it was against God’s laws for him to offer 
the sacrifice to God. But because he had been so blessed in his ministry 
as a king, he felt he could go outside the boundary that God had drawn 
around him, and enter into another ministry. Many preachers have made 
the same mistake. We must recognise the ministry God has given us and 
stay within the boundaries that God has drawn around us. Just because 
God has blessed us in one ministry, does not mean that we can move into 
another ministry that God has not called us to. God has not gifted me as 
an evangelist, but as a teacher. And I have stayed within my boundaries, 
despite the pressure that others have at times, put on me, to go outside 
my boundaries. I don’t want to repeat Saul’s mistake. I value gifted evan-
gelists and work with them – and submit to them in the sphere of their 
ministry. But I stick to my ministry.
Uzziah was another king who tried to be a priest. God struck him down 
with leprosy (2 Chronicles 26). Here we see that God took away Saul’s 
kingdom from him, when he tried to be a priest. Recognise your minis-
try and stay within your boundaries. And allow other people to fulfil 
their ministries. This is a simple law of the body of Christ.
We see Saul’s impatience also here. A few minutes after he had offered 
the sacrifice, Samuel came as he had promised. What a different story 
it  would  have  been,  if  only  Saul  had  waited  just  a  few  minutes  longer!  
Because of his pride and impatience, he lost everything. But he still sat 
on  the  throne  of  Israel  for  another  30  years.  There  are  many  who  are  
sitting on their thrones in Christendom today, like Saul, who have lost 
the anointing of God long, long ago. But because they have got money 
and human authority, they sit on their thrones directing their organisa-
tions. Saul degenerated from a wonderful young man who started out in 
great humility to become one who was useless to God!
Samuel then told Saul, “Your kingdom shall not endure now. You have 
acted foolishly. The Lord now seeks for somebody who is a man after His 
own heart” (13:13, 14).
See the emphasis here on the heart. When Saul was anointed as king, 
the Bible says that his head stood out among the people, for he was 
taller than everybody else (1 Samuel 10:23). He was distinguished by 
his head –  his  brains.  But  God  was  now  looking  for  someone  who  
was distinguished by his heart. David was different from others, not 

170 Through the Bible: The Last Judge and the First King
1 Samuel
because  of  his  head,  but  because  of  his  heart!  He  was  a  man  after  
God’s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14).
There  is  a  vast  difference  between  a  “Christianity  of  the  head”  and  a  
“Christianity of the heart”. Saul represents the first and David represents 
the second. This is the essential difference between religious people and 
spiritual people.  The  Lord  sought  out  for  Himself  a  man  after  His  own  
heart  and  He  found  David.  Our  head  represents  our  brains,  our  intel-
ligence  and  our  cleverness.  Our  heart  represents  our  devotion  to  the  
Lord and our worship of Him. The Father seeks for worshippers, not for 
scholars (John 4:23). If you are not a worshipper, if you are not devoted to 
Jesus Christ, no matter how clever you may be, you can end up like Saul. 
David finished his course triumphantly even though he made mistakes, 
because his heart was right.
In 14:35, we read of the very first altar that Saul ever built. And there 
we see the reason for his failure: He was not a worshipper first of all. 
Saul’s ancestor, Abraham, had been a worshipper. Wherever Abraham 
went, he built an altar to worship the Lord. But Saul was just a smart, 
clever man, and not a worshipper. Jesus said in Matthew 4:10, that we 
have to worship God before we can serve Him. Beware of a Christianity 
that only resides in your head, and that does not lead you to a devotion 
to Jesus Christ and to a worship of God the Father.
In  Chapter  15,  we  see  the second mistake  that  Saul  made.  God  had  
told him to kill all the Amalekites and their animals; but he spared some 
of  the  good  sheep  –  perhaps  wanting  to  keep  them  for  himself.  When  
Samuel confronted him with his failure, he blamed the people for sparing 
the good sheep and oxen and also justified it by giving a pious twist to 
it, saying, “they wanted to sacrifice them to the Lord”. He modified God’s 
command according to his own reason. And just like Adam blamed his 
wife, Saul blamed the people. One who does not know how to acknowledge 
a mistake and take the blame for his own sin, is unfit to be a leader. It is 
our attitude to the small things that determine whether we are qualified 
to be leaders of God’s people or not. Jesus said that the greatest people 
in His kingdom would be those who obeyed God in the little things; and 
the least people in God’s kingdom would be those who ignored the small 
commandments (Matthew 5:19). God evaluates us by our attitude to the 
smaller commandments He has given. 
Saul  could  have  honestly  confessed  his  sin.  But  he  didn’t.  He  kept  
on  insisting  that  he  had  obeyed  the  Lord.  He  told  Samuel,  “I  have  
carried out the commandment of the Lord.... I did obey the voice of the 
Lord.” (verses 13, 20). But when Samuel kept on confronting him, he 
finally admitted, “I was afraid of the people and I listened to their voice.” 

David – The Man After God’s Own Heart                                                                                             171
1 Samuel
(verse 24). A man who is afraid of people’s opinions and listens to their 
voice can never be their leader.
But then he told Samuel, “I’ll acknowledge privately to you that I have 
sinned.  But  please  don’t  let  me  down  publicly.  Please  honour  me  in  the  
presence of the elders. Please come along and worship with me, and act as 
though nothing is wrong” (verse 30). He sought honour from the people. 
He wanted to put up a front of being a holy man. He didn’t want it look 
as though Samuel had stopped supporting him. He wanted the people to 
think that God was still with him.
The Spirit of God now left Saul, and an evil spirit entered him. Suspicion, 
fear, jealousy and evil spirits now occupied the heart that was once filled 
with  humility,  wisdom  and  zeal  for  God.  It  is  very  dangerous  to  know  
the  power  of  the  Spirit  and  then  to  be  unfaithful  –  for  your  latter  end  
becomes worse than your unconverted state. It is far better then, never 
to have known the power of the Spirit at all. 
The Spirit of God now came upon young David who went in the power 
of  the  Spirit  and  slew  Goliath,  the  enemy  of  the  Israelites.  When  Saul  
heard the women praising David for that, he became jealous (18:9), and 
tried  to  kill  David  more  than  once  (18:11; 19:10). Degeneration  sets  
in  very  quickly,  when  jealousy  is  allowed  to  reign  in  the  heart.  Saul’s  
madness became so bad that he even tried to kill his own son Jonathan 
with a spear once. Saul was very eager to promote Jonathan to take over 
his ministry, even though he knew that Jonathan had no anointing from 
God for that ministry. Many Christians are doing the same thing all over 
Christendom  these  days,  proving  that  they  too  have  the  spirit  of  Saul  
in them.
Saul spent the rest of his life chasing after David, trying to kill him. 
His anger became uncontrollable. He once killed 85 Levitical priests and 
their  families  just  because  they  did  not  report  to  him  that  David  had  
come to their town (Chapter 22). But, more than once, when David could 
have killed Saul, he spared Saul’s life. Yet, in spite of all this, Saul did 
not repent. Things only went from bad to worse in his life. That is what 
happens when you become jealous of someone who is more blessed by 
God than you are. Many Christian leaders seek to push out from their 
churches, those who are more anointed than they are. But such men go 
down and down spiritually, until they have destroyed themselves totally.
Saul then got involved in witchcraft (28:8) and finally committed suicide 
(31:4, 5). What a sad end for a man who had started out so well.
David – The Man After God’s Own Heart
What a contrast to Saul was David – the man after God’s own heart. 
The Lord told Samuel to stop praying for Saul, because He was now 
going to anoint someone else to be Israel’s king (1 Samuel 16). Samuel was 

172 Through the Bible: The Last Judge and the First King
1 Samuel
told to go to the house of Jesse where God would show him one of his 
sons who was to be the next king.
Jesse had eight sons. When Samuel told Jesse to call all his sons for 
a sacrifice, Jesse called only the first seven. He didn’t even bother to 
call  David,  the  youngest  –  obviously  because  nobody  thought  much  of  
David. He was the baby of the family – perhaps just 15 years old. David 
was looking after the sheep. The smart, handsome Eliab, the eldest son 
came to Samuel first (16:6). And Samuel thought, “This is certainly the 
Lord’s anointed”. But God said “No”. God told Samuel not to look at his 
appearance.
And  then  we  come  to  that  lovely  verse  that  reads:  “Man  looks  at  the  
outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.” (1 Samuel 16:7). Notice 
the emphasis again on the heart, and not on the head.
Then  Jesse  called  the  next  son.  Again  the  Lord  said  “No”.  Thus  all  
seven sons passed before Samuel one by one and the Lord said “No” to all 
of them. Samuel was surprised and confused. He asked Jesse, “Are these 
all the sons you have?” Jesse said, “No, there is one more – the youngest. 
But he is not even an adult. He is a teenager. So we didn’t bother to call 
him. He is not smart like his seven older brothers. He spends his days 
strumming his harp and singing songs to God! So we appointed him to 
look after our sheep. But if you want, we’ll call him.” 
Young  David  was  called.  He  didn’t  even  know  what  was  happening.  
But God had been watching him and had seen his devotion and love 
for the Lord. As soon as he came, the Lord told Samuel, “This is the 
one.” And Samuel anointed him, and the Spirit of the Lord came might-
ily upon that young teenage boy. 
God searched all over Israel for someone who loved Him and found one 
young boy. God is searching all over India today for young boys and girls 
(for  in  the  new  covenant,  the  Spirit  is  to  be  poured  out  on  both  sexes) 
whom He can anoint and use. There may be many people like the older 
seven sons of Jesse who have more prominence than you. Don’t worry 
about that. God does not assess as man assesses. Do your job faithfully – 
even if it be looking after sheep. The Lord may be having His eye on you. 
Be faithful and He will call you one day and anoint you like He anointed 
David. The Lord picks up young people in their teenage years and trains 
them to serve Him. He trains them over a long period of time and then 
leads them into a ministry. 
As soon as the Spirit of the Lord came upon David, the Spirit departed 
from Saul (16:13, 14).
Victory in Private and in Public
When David sees Goliath threatening Israel, notice his intense concern 
for the glory of God’s name and the honour of God’s people: “Who is 

Victory in Private and in Public                                                                                                               173
1 Samuel
this uncircumcised Philistine that he should taunt the armies of the living 
God?” (17:26). While the Israelites were all as unbelieving as their fore-
fathers who had wandered for 40 years in the wilderness, David knew 
what God had done to the Canaanite giants through Joshua and Caleb. 
And so he offered to go and fight Goliath. 
When  Saul  laughed  at  David  saying  he  was  just  a  youth  (David  was  
probably about 17 years old now), David told Saul about some incidents 
in his private life, which he had never told anyone about before – not even 
his parents. He told Saul, “When I was tending my father’s flock, some-
times a lion or a bear would come and take a lamb from the flock. I would 
go after the wild animal, rescue the lamb from its mouth and kill the wild 
animal.  I  have  killed  both  the  lion  and  the  bear.”  (17:34–36).  David  had  
known what Samson did when the Spirit came upon him. So after Samuel 
had anointed him, David felt that God would help him too just like God 
helped Samson. And God did.
How  many  shepherds  in  Israel  would  go  after  a  lion  just  to  save  the  
life of a wee, tiny lamb? When God saw this care that David had for 
the littlest lamb in his flock, He decided that David was fit to shepherd 
Israel.  When  Satan  gets  hold  of  a  weak  brother,  it  is  the  shepherd’s  
duty to go after Satan in spiritual warfare and to rescue that brother 
from Satan’s grip. That’s the type of shepherd God is looking for today.
This  story  also  teaches  us  that  we  have  to  slay  the  enemies  in  our  
private life first, before we can face Goliath publicly. If you have not over-
come the lion and the bear in your private life, don’t imagine that God 
will call you to face Goliath in public. Many would like to have a public 
ministry  that  demolishes  Satan’s  fortresses.  But  they  must  start  with  
destroying Satan’s fortresses in their own mind first. They must show a 
concern for God’s name and for the little lambs in private first.
Saul then told David to at least put on his (Saul’s) armour. That would 
offer some protection against Goliath. Was David to trust in Saul’s armour 
or in God? Finally David took it all off and went forth trusting in God alone. 
He told Goliath, “You have come to me with sword, spear, and javelin. But I 
come to you in the name of the Lord” (verse 45). Thus he killed Goliath with 
a single stone and used Goliath’s own sword to chop off his head. 
This is how we are to go against Satan today. And God uses Satan’s 
own  weapons  (Goliath’s  own  sword)  to  destroy  him.  “Through  death,  
He destroyed him who had the power of death” (Hebrews 2:14). Once 
Goliath  was  killed,  the  other  Philistines  ran  away  (1  Samuel  17:51). 
This teaches us that once we kill the giant sin in our life (“the sin that 
so easily entangles us” – Hebrews 12:1), we will find that many other 
sins in our lives are conquered too.

174 Through the Bible: The Last Judge and the First King
1 Samuel
In Chapter 18, we read of the lovely attitude that Jonathan, Saul’s son, 
had  towards  David.  Jonathan  was  undoubtedly  older  than  David  and  
also the heir to the throne. So he should have hated David for being so 
popular in Israel now and thus being a threat to him. But instead, we 
see  a  pure  love  and  respect  in  his  heart  for  David.  This  indicates  that  
Jonathan  was  one  who  was  more  concerned  for  the  glory  of  God  and  
the good of Israel than his own personal advancement. Therefore he did 
not have any of the jealousy that plagued his father Saul. His heart was 
closely knit to David. He gave David his royal robe, his sword, and his 
bow, thereby saying, “Here, David. By giving you these, I am indicating 
that you are the rightful heir to the throne (the robe) and I will never fight 
against you (sword and bow). I submit myself to you” (18:4). 
What a fine young man Jonathan was. In Chapter 14, we read of his 
faith in God by which he overcame the Philistines. And here we see his 
total freedom from jealousy and his discernment to recognise whom God 
had anointed. 
It is wonderful when an older brother can recognise the anointing of 
God upon a younger brother, and allow the younger brother to take the 
lead  over  him  in  the  ministry.  We  see  a  beautiful  example  of  that  in  
Barnabas. In Acts 13:2, we read of God calling ‘Barnabas and Saul’ for 
His  work.  Barnabas  was  both  senior  and  older  to  Saul,  and  so  it  was  
only natural that his name came first. But very soon, this became ‘Paul 
and Barnabas’ (verse 42). How? Barnabas graciously withdrew into the 
background  when  he  saw  a  greater  anointing  on  his  younger  brother  
Paul. What a powerful force the church of Jesus Christ would have been 
on earth, if it had more people like Jonathan and Barnabas in it, who did 
not  seek  their  own,  had  no  jealousy  whatever,  but  instead,  sought  the  
glory of God alone, and were quick to support younger brothers who had 
a mightier anointing.
David  prospered  in  whatever  he  did,  because  God  was  with  him  
(18:5, 14). God’s presence with this young 17-year-old boy enabled him 
also “to behave more wisely” than the other much-older people in Saul’s 
army and palace (18:30). What tremendous blessing comes upon our life 
and upon others when “God is with us.”
David’s Trials
David had to flee for his life because Saul now tried to kill him. But 
no-one can kill one for whom God has made a plan, before that plan is 
fully fulfilled. In Chapter 22:1, 2, we read of a few in Israel who recognised 
that  the  anointing  had  departed  from  Saul  and  was  now  upon  David.  
They now gathered together with David and moved with him constantly 
from cave to cave! Like those men, we too must recognise where God is 
moving today – and not where He moved yesterday. We must stand with 
those upon whom the anointing of God rests today. 

David’s Trials                                                                                                                                              175
1 Samuel
David  lived  in  daily  dependence  on  the  Lord  for  guidance.  He  would  
ask the Lord before going to fight the Philistines and if the Lord told 
him to go, he would go even against the advice of his own men (Chapter 
23:1–5). This is how he became a man after God’s own heart: He listened 
to God more than to his friends.
After  David  had  delivered  the  people  of  Keilah  from  the  oppression  
of  the  Philistines,  Saul  heard  that  David  was  in  Keilah,  he  went  there,  
certain  that  he  would  catch  David  at  last,  because  Keilah  was  a  city  
that was enclosed with double gates and bars. Humanly speaking, David 
could now have reasoned that the people of Keilah would be so grateful 
to him that they would never betray him into the hands of Saul. But he 
still decided to seek God about a simple matter like this. And God told 
him that the people of Keilah would betray him. So he listened to God 
and left Keilah and thus saved himself and his men (23:6–13). “God did 
not deliver him into Saul’s hand” (23:14). This was the secret of David’s 
early life – like Samuel, he listened to God daily.
We see David’s noble attitude in Chapter 24:4, 5, in sparing Saul’s life 
when  he  had  Saul  at  his  mercy.  In  fact  David’s  conscience  convicted  
him for cutting off just a small piece of Saul’s robe, which he had done 
just  to  show  Saul  that  he  could  have  killed  him  if  he  wanted  to.  Even  
though Saul was moved to tears on hearing this and went home then, 
after a while he started hunting for David again (26:2). Jealousy, anger 
and hatred have a way of coming back again and again like the waves on 
a beach, if they are not dealt with thoroughly.
In Chapter  30,  we  see  a  few  interesting  things.  David  found  himself  
in a difficult situation. When he and his men had gone to battle, the 
Amalekites  had  come  and  destroyed  the  city  where  the  families  of  his  
people were staying and taken their families captive. The situation was 
so bad that all the men began to weep and also to blame David for their 
problems.  They  wanted  to  stone  him  to  death  (verse  6).  And  then  we  
read  these  lovely  words:  “But  David  encouraged  himself  (and  strength-
ened  himself)  in  the  Lord”  (verse  6).  What  an  example  for  us  to  follow,  
when even our friends turn against us. David again sought the Lord and 
the Lord told him to pursue after the Amalekites and assured him that 
he would recover everything (verse 8).
But David did not know in which direction to go to find these Amale-
kites. It is wonderful to see how God led him to them. It was through a 
simple  act  of  kindness  to  a  dying  stranger.  David  and  his  men  saw  an  
Egyptian lying in the desert in a coma, half-dead. They cared for him and 
gave him something to eat and drink. When he revived, they discovered 
that  he  had  been  forsaken  by  the  Amalekites  in  the  desert,  because  he  
was sick (30:11–13). He was the one who then led David to the Amalekites. 
This teaches us how God rewards us when we are kind to strangers.
Thus  David  found  and  defeated  the  Amalekites.  Then  it  is  written  
thrice, that “David recovered all” that had been stolen by the Amalekites 

176 Through the Bible: The Last Judge and the First King
1 Samuel
(verses  18–20)  –  a  beautiful  picture  of  Jesus  recovering  all  that  Satan  
had stolen from us!
When the battle was over and David returned to the camp, there were 
200 of his men there who had been too exhausted to follow David into 
battle, and who had stayed behind to look after David’s goods. Some of 
David’s worthless men then said that the spoils of the battle should not 
be shared with these men who did not fight. But we see the largeness of 
David’s heart there. He said that those who stayed at home to look after 
the baggage should get an equal share of the spoils of war, as those who 
went out to battle and fought. And this became a law in Israel from that 
day onwards.
In Chapter  31,  we  read  of  how  Saul  committed  suicide.  God  knows  
how to deal with those who persecute his children – in His own way and 
in His own time. David never had to lay a hand on Saul. He allowed God 
to deal with him. When Alexander the coppersmith troubled the apostle 
Paul, 1000 years later, Paul’s attitude was the same: “The Lord will repay 
him” (2 Timothy 4:14). We can rest assured that one day God will make 
every man reap what he has sown and that God will avenge every one of 
His servants who were persecuted by others. For revenge belongs to the 
Lord and He has promised to repay one day (Romans 12:19). Until then, 
our duty is to do good to our enemies, like David did to Saul.
It was through all those difficulties and trials that David faced (over a 
period of about 13 years), that he finally became a man of God and a 
successful  king.  We  read  these  words  in  Psalm  66:10–12:  “You  have  
tested me O God. You have refined me as silver is refined. You allowed 
me to be trapped in nets. You allowed heavy, oppressive burdens to be 
laid on my back. You allowed men to ride over my head. You took me 
through the burning fire and then through icy-cold water. But finally, 
You brought me out into a place of spiritual abundance and anointing, 
where my cup is now overflowing with blessing to multitudes of people. 
Praise the Lord” (Psalms 66:10–13 - free paraphrase). It is not known 
who wrote this psalm. But these words were true of David’s experience.
Saul,  on  the  other  hand,  grew  up  in  a  rich  home,  and  went  straight  
from that life of comfort to become a king. He never faced any trials or 
difficulties. So he never knew God and he was a failure as a king. 
Solomon, who came after David, also never faced any trials or difficul-
ties. He grew up in ease and comfort as a prince in the royal palace. 
He also became a failure as a king. 
These examples teach us that it is only through trials and difficulties 
that we can know God and be effective and successful in our ministry. 

David’s Trials                                                                                                                                              177
1 Samuel
This was what made Paul such a successful apostle too (Read 2 Corinthians 
1:4–11; 11:23–33).  And  this  is  why  many  preachers  today,  who  have  
become rich by preaching the gospel, and who live in comfort, are neither 
spiritual themselves, nor godly examples to their flock. 
God  may  have  called  you  to  be  His  servant.  But  don’t  imagine  that  
you are ready to serve Him, just because you were called. If you don’t go 
through long periods of trial faithfully, you cannot be a spiritual leader 
of God’s people. You will only end up like Saul and Solomon, and destroy 
yourself finally. So God will have to first take you through long periods of 
trial and difficulties. He will allow others to misunderstand you and to be 
jealous of you. He will allow them to suppress you and to oppress you. If 
you humble yourself (like David did) and trust God, in all these circum-
stances, God will bring you forth one day, into a place of abundance and 
blessing. 
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

2 SAMUEL
The Reign of David
I
n this book, we read about the reign of David – how he was made king, 
how he won a number of victories, how he fell into sin, and how he 
had problems in his family until the end of his life.
David’s Attitude to Saul
Chapter 1: Here we read about the death of Saul. Saul had hated David 
so much that he had chased him all over Israel, for more than ten years, 
trying to kill him. Now at last he was dead. If you were in David’s place, 
what would your reaction have been to such news? Notice David’s reaction.
We  know  that  Saul  had  committed  suicide  (1  Samuel  31).  But  an  
Amalekite man came to David, and told him a lie, seeking to earn David’s 
favour. He told David that he had killed Saul, at Saul’s request and gave 
Saul’s  crown  and  bracelet  to  David.  He  expected  David  to  be  delighted  
and to reward him for this action. But instead, David tore his own clothes 
and wept and fasted the whole day in mourning for Saul (1:1–11). Then 
David asked this man how he was not afraid to kill the Lord’s anointed? 
He then got one of his young men to kill the Amalekite for daring to kill 
Saul. That man paid quite a price for the lie he told. 
But see David’s attitude there. This was one of the things that made 
David a man after God’s own heart. We know that Jesus said, “Love your 
enemies.  Bless  them  that  curse  you,  do  good  to  them  that  hurt  you  and  
harm  you,  pray  for  them  that  persecute  you”  (Matthew  5:44).  David  did  
that. He had a new covenant attitude in old covenant times. David did 
not  hate  Saul.  Even  though  Saul  had  lost  the  anointing,  David  always  
said, “I will not touch him.”
David  then  wrote  a  lamentation  for  Saul  and  Jonathan  and  spoke  
wonderful  words  of  praise  about  them  in  all  sincerity  from  his  heart.  
Here is a lesson for us to learn how a man of God should behave towards 

182 Through the Bible: The Reign of David
2 Samuel
a person who is evil towards him. David said “Your beauty, O Israel, is 
slain on your high places.... How have the mighty fallen!” (1:19, 25, 27). 
We can understand his praising Jonathan, because he was a close friend 
of David’s. But he also praised Saul calling him a mighty man who had 
won many victories. He appreciated the good he saw in Saul and left it at 
that. He left Saul’s judgement to God and refused to judge him himself. 
There we see David as a man after God’s own heart. It was such a man 
whom God picked up and placed on the throne of Israel.
Waiting For God’s Time
Chapter 2:1: “David inquired of the Lord...”. As we saw earlier in 1 Samuel 
23:2–4 and 30:8, David’s constant habit was to seek the Lord’s will about 
everything.  In  2  Samuel  5:17–25,  we  read  of  two  battles  against  the  
Philistines in which David sought the will of God. The second time, the 
Lord told him to change his strategy and to attack them from the rear. 
Each time the Lord changed the strategy. David was a man of war, but he 
always got his strategy from the Lord and that was why he always won. 
When there was a famine in the land, he asked the Lord why there was a 
famine (2 Samuel 21:1). There were, however, some matters on which he 
did not seek the Lord’s will. Three examples of that are: 
1. when he got married to six wives (2 Samuel 3); 
2. when he called Bathsheba to his palace (2 Samuel 11); and 
3. when he took a census of Israel (2 Samuel 24). 
And for all these failures, he paid a very heavy price. But whenever he 
waited on the Lord for guidance, he never went astray. This is a lesson 
and a warning for all of us.
He  was  a  man  after  God’s  own  heart,  but  he  failed  badly  too.  The 
description  of  his  failures  also  encourages  us  because  we  learn  there  
that God can use people who have failed. The failures of God’s servants 
described in the Bible encourage us much more than the description of 
their successes – because we have all failed the Lord on numerous occa-
sions too. We all blunder and fail and do foolish things, especially when 
we are young – because when we are young, we are full of zeal but have 
very little wisdom. We do and say so many things in a very unwise way 
in our youth. But God is merciful. He picks up people like us who have 
failed, and still makes us men and women after His own heart.
The  men  of  Judah  came  and  anointed  David  king  over  the  house  of  
Judah first. Later on he was anointed king over all Israel (5:3–5). He was 
30 years old when he became king over Judah. And he had to wait for 
another  7½  years,  before  he  ruled  over  all  Israel.  So  he  had  to  wait  
for more than 20 years in all, before God fulfilled His promise to him. 
His waiting period was almost as long as Abraham’s! But David waited 
patiently. We are called to follow the examples of such men who through 

Waiting For God’s Time                                                                                                                            183
2 Samuel
faith  and  patience  inherited  God’s  promises.  David  never  grabbed  the  
throne for himself. He waited for God to give it to him in His own time. 
If only he had adopted the same attitude of not grabbing when it came to 
Bathsheba, how different his story would have been. 
If you want to be a man after God’s own heart, learn not to grab. Jacob 
was a grabber, and as long as he was a grabber he could not become Israel.
Children  are  born  into  the  world  with  their  fists  closed.  If  you  put 
your  finger  into  a  baby’s  hand,  he  will  grab  your  finger  immediately. 
As he grows up, he learns to grab toys and many other things. That is 
man’s nature – grabbing things for himself. We spend all our lives grab-
bing things for ourselves. We grab for position, honour and money and 
many other things. Jesus was different. He never grabbed anything for 
Himself. His fists were not closed. His palms were always open towards 
all people. Finally He opened His palms to be crucified on Calvary too. 
That is the example for all of us to follow. Yield. Give up your rights. Give 
to others, and God will give back to you in abundance. God Himself will 
give you a ministry, a position and everything else you need – if only you 
can wait for His time. It is far better to get things from God than to grab 
them ourselves. Jacob did not have to grab the birthright, by deceiving 
his father. He could have waited for God to give it to him – like David did. 
And God would have given it to him. We express our lack of faith in God, 
every time we grab something. 
Suppose you are attracted to a young man or woman, whom you want 
to get married to; you could begin to think like this: “If I don’t grab her/
him  quickly,  somebody  else  will  get  her/him.”  That  is  unbelief.  If  you  
trust in God, you won’t be impatient and grab. Instead, you will say, 
“Lord, what You have reserved for me, I will definitely get. No-one can 
marry a person whom you have reserved for me.” The same principle 
applies to any ministry that God may have planned for you. No-one else 
can grab that. God will lead you into that ministry, if you wait on Him.
Learn to trust God and never complain against people. If God makes 
you wait for 20 years, wait. You will become a much better leader at the 
end of that time. As we saw, Saul and Solomon never learnt to wait for 
anything. They were born into comfort and lived without any trials and 
pressures. I feel sorry for anyone whose life is so comfortable and easy, 
that he has no trials or pressures. It’s the one who has faced rejection 
from men, to whom God gives a ministry.
We  see  in  David’s  case  too,  that  once  he  became  king  and  his  life  
became comfortable and easy, he began to make mistakes one after the 
other.  We  read  in  Chapter  3:2–5,  that  six sons  were  born  to  him  –  but  
through six different wives!!
The  man  after  God’s  own  heart  also  started  going  astray  once  he  
became a king. He sought God’s will about many things. But he did not 

184 Through the Bible: The Reign of David
2 Samuel
ask the Lord whether he should marry a second time, a third time and a 
sixth time! Isaac had only one wife, and Moses had only one wife. And as 
far as we know, Joshua had only one wife too. Why then did David have 
so many wives? Because he decided to be like all the other kings in the 
world. And he suffered tremendously as a result. What a warning this is 
for us not to follow the spirit in the world.
But we must not forget that David lived under the old covenant, when 
people’s  hearts  were  hard,  because  they  did  not  have  the  Holy  Spirit.  
So  Moses  permitted  them  even  to  divorce  their  wives  (as  Jesus  said  in  
Matthew 19:8). So we cannot judge them. God’s standards are different 
now  for  us  who  have  received  the  Holy  Spirit.  We  are  living  under  the  
new covenant today. But many Christians who fall into adultery today, 
still  excuse  themselves,  saying,  “Well,  David  also  fell.”  But  David  lived  
under the old covenant. He did not have the Holy Spirit dwelling within 
him. The Spirit of the Lord rested only upon him. But we can have the 
Holy Spirit dwelling within us. Those old covenant saints could have the 
Holy Spirit only for their ministry. But we have the Holy Spirit dwelling 
within, to change our character. So we cannot excuse our sins by equat-
ing ourselves with David or Samson.
Vengeance Belongs to God
In Chapter  4:8,  we  read  of  two  men  who  killed  Ish-bosheth  (Saul’s  son)  
and brought his head to David hoping that David would reward them for 
it. But David was so angry with them that he commanded that they be 
killed immediately. David believed that vengeance belonged to God, and 
so he would never take vengeance himself or permit anyone else to take it.
This  is  an  important  principle  that  we  must  remember  at  all  times.  
Romans12:19 is very clear about this. God does not need our help to 
administer justice or to take vengeance. What would you do if some-
body fell down at your feet to worship you? You would do what Peter 
did – lift him up and say, “Don’t worship me, worship belongs to God.” 
Just as much as worship belongs to God, vengeance also belongs to 
God. So, if we try to take revenge on someone, that’s not any different 
from  accepting  worship  from  people.  We  have  no  more  right  to  take  
revenge  than  to  receive  worship.  Whatever  harm  anyone  may  have  
done to us, we must leave it to God to deal with him in His own way 
and in His own time. We must not even desire anything evil for that 
person. When we serve the Lord, we will come across other believers 
who speak evil of us or try to destroy our ministry. I have discovered 
that we cannot serve the Lord effectively, without having many people 
speaking  evil  of  us,  spreading  false  stories  about  us,  accusing  us  of  
teaching  false  doctrine,  etc.  We  may  be  tempted  to  take  revenge  on  
them. But we must resist that temptation firmly, and leave them in 

Man’s Way and God’s Way                                                                                                                      185
2 Samuel
God’s hands. The Bible says that there is only one Judge who has the 
right to destroy (James 4:12). So we must leave their fate in the hands 
of that one Judge.
If the Lord has anointed you, no-one can destroy your ministry, because 
it has come from heaven. Many people accused Jesus and Paul of being 
false  teachers.  Jesus  was  even  accused  of  casting  out  demons  by  the  
power of the prince of devils. But Jesus never wasted His time answering 
them. The sincere were not led astray by such false accusations either. 
Only the insincere went astray. 
We read in James 2:6 that rich believers were oppressing poor believers 
in  those  days  and  personally dragging  them  to  court.  This  is  unbeliev-
able. But it is happening today too! One has to be both rich and wicked 
to drag another believer to court. It is amazing how blind believers can 
be. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6 that the same thing was happening in 
Corinth. Such rich believers have not understood that there is only one 
Judge Who has the right to judge and take revenge. They are sitting on 
God’s throne. So Paul warned them that those who do such things will 
never  enter  God’s  kingdom  (1  Corinthians  6:9  read  in  the  context  of  the  
first 8 verses). If someone has done wrong to you, hasn’t God seen that? 
Isn’t He able to deal with that person? If you believe that and you believe 
in an Almighty God, then leave it to God to deal with him.
Man’s Way and God’s Way
Chapter 6: David had a great desire to bring the ark of God to Jerusalem. 
The desire was a good one. But he didn’t do it the way God had commanded 
to do it in His Law. The result was calamity – one of David’s faithful men 
died. Once, when the Philistines had captured the ark, God had judged 
them with sickness and they decided to return the ark back to Israel. So 
they sent the ark back on a bullock cart. David had heard of that inci-
dent. He knew that the law of Moses had said very clearly that the ark 
should  be  carried  only  by  the  Kohathites,  the  sons  of  Levi.  But  David  
thought that method was all right for short distances. But since this was 
a long trip, he decided that the Philistine method was better and more 
sensible. So he put the ark on a bullock cart. The oxen stumbled on the 
rough roads and the ark began to shake. Uzzah reached out his hand to 
hold the ark so that it would not fall. God struck him down immediately 
for his irreverence and he died. 
Uzzah did what he did, with a good motive. But he still violated God’s 
law. Even if our motive is good, if we go against God’s Word, we will still 
suffer. To do a right thing with a bad motive is unacceptable to God. But it 
is equally unacceptable to Him if we do a wrong thing with a good motive. 
The end can never justify the means. Here we see that Uzzah’s motive was 
good – to prevent the ark from falling. But Uzzah also knew that the Law 

186 Through the Bible: The Reign of David
2 Samuel
of Moses had said that no-one should touch the ark. Even the Kohathites 
who carried the ark were not allowed to touch the ark itself. They had 
to cover the ark with the veil of the tabernacle before carrying it, so that 
they did not actually touch the ark (Number 4:15). God had clearly stated 
that the punishment for anyone touching the ark would be death.
We can face this question, when we decide to do evangelism. How shall 
we  do  it  –  God’s  way  or  man’s  way?  Shall  we  imitate  the  methods  of  
multinational companies when we do God’s work? 
Many Christians say today that they need money in order to do evan-
gelism. Is your dependence on money or on the Holy Spirit? What you 
should  say  is,  “We  need  the  Holy  Spirit’s  power  to  do  evangelism.”  If  
you  have  the  Holy  Spirit’s  power,  whether  you  have  money  or  not,  
God’s work will be done. Only worldly corporations and organisations 
need money in order to survive. When churches also come to the place 
where they say, “Only if we have money we can go on”, we have to say 
that  they  too  have  descended  to  the  level  of  these  worldly  organisa-
tions. In the Acts of the Apostles there is no mention of money at all in 
relation to evangelism or God’s work. Occasionally, they would collect 
money for the poor believers, but never to pay the apostles! They never 
prayed to God for more and more money, as so many people do today. 
They prayed for the power of the Holy Spirit. The methods of the world 
(the  bullock  carts)  have  replaced  God’s  methods  today.  That’s  why  
there is spiritual death. We need to understand what God is trying to 
say to us here.
Later on, David brought the ark to Jerusalem, the proper way – on the 
shoulders of the Levites. This time he was so full of joy that he danced 
before  the  Lord  with  all  his  might  (6:14).  That  was  one  of  the  ways  in  
which  they  expressed  their  praise  to  God  in  those  days.  They  not  only  
used  musical  instruments  and  clapped  their  hands  and  shouted,  they  
also danced. But as David was coming to the city, his wife Michal (the 
daughter of Saul) saw him dancing and was very upset (verse 16). She 
despised  him  in  her  heart.  She  despised  an  anointed  servant  of  God  
who was praising God in a way that she did not appreciate. There may 
be people who are praising God today in a way that you don’t appreci-
ate. You don’t have to imitate them. But you don’t have to despise them 
either. Michal did not have to start dancing like David. But she was not 
to despise her husband. We should never imagine that the way we praise 
God is the only right way.
Many Christian groups feel that the particular way in which they praise 
God on Sunday mornings is the only right way to do it. And then they 
require everyone to do it their way. In some Christian groups, everyone 
sits quietly on Sunday mornings as if it were a funeral service. That does 
not appeal to me, because a Sunday-morning service must not be like a 

Man’s Way and God’s Way                                                                                                                      187
2 Samuel
funeral service. It must be a time of rejoicing, because we are celebrating 
the fact that the cross is empty, that Jesus conquered the grave and is 
risen from the dead. But looking at these folk, we would think that Jesus 
was  still  dead!  Then  there  are  other  Christians  who  go  to  the  opposite  
extreme. They feel that the Holy Spirit is present in a meeting only when 
the noise reaches a certain decibel-level – and so they keep raising their 
voice and working up their emotions, to “bring the Holy Spirit into their 
midst”. That  is  a  deception.  The  Holy  Spirit  doesn’t  come  to  a  meeting  
when the volume is raised on the amplifier. He is with those who have a 
clear conscience. 
I  don’t  want  to  despise  either  of  these  groups.  But  I  don’t  want  to  
imitate either of them. I am free to praise the Lord in my own way. Don’t 
despise the way another person praises the Lord, and don’t imagine the 
way you praise Him is the only right way. Give others freedom. God looks 
at the heart, and not at the outward expression.
Chapter  6:20:  “David  returned  to  bless  his  household.”  What  a  beau-
tiful  thing  to  do  –  to  bless  one’s  household  –  especially  when  coming  
home exhausted after having danced on the street for many miles! I wish 
every husband would come home from a tired day’s work to bless their 
household, instead of coming home in a bad mood and making demands 
on his wife. David had a nagging wife in Michal but that did not quench 
his joy in the Lord! As soon as he entered through the door, she started 
nagging him, yelling at him and criticising him for dancing like the ordi-
nary  people  instead  of  behaving  with  the  dignity  of  a  king.  What  did  
David reply? He said he would not be bothered by his wife’s opinion, but 
would continue dancing before the Lord for the rest of his life (verse 21). 
The Lord judged Michal for despising her husband and she was barren 
all her life.
Chapter 7: David now wanted to build a temple for the Lord. Nobody 
told him to do it. But he thought in his heart, “I dwell in a beautiful house, 
but the ark of God dwells within a tent” (verse 2). I wish more believers 
would  think  like  that:  “Lord,  what  a  comfortable  house  I  have  built  for  
myself. How much money and time I have spent building my own house. 
How little I have sacrificed for Your work! How little I am concerned about 
Your work!” God’s work requires workers who will sacrifice themselves, 
their ambitions, their time and their money. Many believers work over-
time in their factories and make profit for their companies. Can’t we as 
God’s servants do a little overtime work for Him – without any pay and 
without any complaining?
David was a man after God’s own heart, and he was concerned about 
God’s house. May all of us have such a heart as his, till the end of our 
days – always concerned about God’s house more than our own house. 
God will take care of your house if you take care of His. Many years ago 
I said to the Lord, “Lord, I have a house (family) and You have a house 
(family).  Give  me  grace  to  look  after  Your  house  (family),  and  You  look  

188 Through the Bible: The Reign of David
2 Samuel
after mine.” I made that little exchange with the Lord, and I want to say 
that God has been more faithful in looking after my house than I have 
been in looking after His. 
But God did not permit David to build His house. The reason was that 
David had been a man of war and only a man of peace could build God’s 
house (1 Chronicles 28:3).
Notice this principle: A man of war cannot build God’s house. We have 
to  go  beyond  the  war  and  enter  into  God’s  rest.  War  is  necessary  to  
begin with; but we must enter into rest.
David cleared the ground for Solomon by defeating all the enemies of 
Israel. He also collected all the gold and silver required for the temple. 
But Solomon built it. Are we willing to do that? Can we do all the hard 
work and then let someone else get the honour for doing the work? Or 
do we want the honour ourselves? A man after God’s own heart will do 
all the work in the background to make it easier for others and then let 
them get the honour.
2 Samuel 8:15: This verse reads in the Living Bible thus: “David was 
fair to all the people”. This is a very important requirement in a leader – 
fairness in administering justice and total impartiality.
In Chapter 9, we see his kindness to Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s son, who 
was a cripple. Mephibosheth considered himself to be like “a dead dog” 
who  deserved  nothing (verse  8).  But  David  ordered  that  Mephibosheth  
should eat at his table regularly. This is a picture of the grace of God, 
where Christ lifts us, dead dogs, to sit with Him at His table.
David’s Great Fall
In Chapter 11 we see the story of David’s great fall. We can all learn a 
lesson there from how he fell. “It happened in the spring at the time when 
kings go out to battle....” Kings did not go to battle in the winter when it 
was cold, but did so in springtime. In every battle, David was always the 
leader, leading the armies of Israel to fight their enemies. But this time 
David felt he should relax. It is when we stop fighting and relax in the 
battle that we start sinning. It’s when we’re not in the place where God 
wants us to be, that we fall into sin. David’s place was on the battlefield. 
Instead he was sleeping in the palace. If he had been on the battlefield 
that day, he might never have fallen thus.
It’s when things are going well with us and we stop fighting the Lord’s 
battles and start sending our juniors to do the Lord’s work that we have 
problems. Many Christian leaders are sitting like kings in their palaces 
and making their juniors do all the hard work in the fields. 
I always want to be a junior brother in the Lord’s church, till the end 
of my life. I want to be out in the field, working and fighting for the Lord 

David’s Great Fall                                                                                                                                      189
2 Samuel
even if I am 90 years old. I want to be on the battlefield till the end of my 
life. I hope you want to be there too. There is no spiritual danger on the 
battlefield. Such dangers are in the palace. David was perfectly safe as 
long as he was on the battlefield. He was in danger only in the palace. 
Do  we  fall  into  sin  when  we  are  facing  trial  and  pressure  and  sick-
ness and financial difficulties? No. It is when things became easy for us 
and we have plenty of money, when our businesses are prospering, and 
nobody is sick at home – that is when we sin. That’s the time you must 
be more alert.
David stayed at home at Jerusalem (11:1). He was not like Moses who 
prayed while Joshua was fighting. If David had been praying for Joab 
who was out on the battlefield fighting, then he would have been safe. 
But  he  was  sleeping.  “In  the  evening  David  rose  from  his  bed”  (11:2). 
I don’t know whether he was sleeping the whole morning and woke up 
in the evening. He got up from his bed, and instead of praying first, he 
walked on the roof of his palace. That’s when he saw this pretty woman, 
Bathsheba,  and  was  tempted.  If  he  had  nipped  the  temptation  in  the  
bud, right then, and stopped it at the first stage, he would never have 
reached the final stage. 
When he looked and was tempted, he could have turned away saying, 
“This  is  dangerous.  Let  me  be  careful”.  He  could  have  gone  and  spent  
some  time  in  prayer  for  Joab.  Then  when  he  enquired  and  discovered  
that she was someone else’s wife, he could have stopped himself at least 
then saying, “O I can’t possibly have her”! If he had prayed for Bathsheba 
that God would make her a pure, holy wife for Uriah, that prayer itself 
would have prevented him from sinning. But in that moment, he forgot 
all  about  the  God  Who  had  made  him  a  king.  He  was  now  a  powerful  
monarch who could have anyone he wanted. And so he committed adul-
tery with her. 
Let  us  not  criticise  David.  Have  you  admired  the  beauty  of  someone  
else’s wife? Because you are not a powerful king, you may not have been 
able  to  grab  her.  So  you  only  looked  and  lusted!  There  isn’t  really  any  
difference between you and David!
When Bathsheba became pregnant, David was in a fix. He had to cover 
up his sin now. So he called her husband Uriah back from the battlefield 
and told him to go and stay at home with his wife that night. But Uriah 
was a man with such a sense of responsibility to his fellow-soldiers that 
he did not go to his house. He told David, “My colleagues are fighting in 
the battlefield. How then can I go home and sleep with my wife?” Uriah 
was a much better man than David at that time. Many junior workers on 
the field are often far better than their mission leaders. Now David didn’t 
know what to do. So he began to scheme. Once you sin, you are tempted 
to commit many more sins in order to cover up your first sin. He should 
have gone to Uriah in all honesty and asked for his forgiveness. Instead 
of doing that, he tried to protect his reputation. So he sent Uriah back 

190 Through the Bible: The Reign of David
2 Samuel
into the battlefield and told General Joab to put him right in front where 
the battle was the thickest, so that Uriah would be killed.
What an evil thing David did! I thank God that Scripture is absolutely 
honest and does not cover up the failures of its greatest heroes. As you 
and I look into the corruption of our own flesh, we will discover that we 
are no better than David. We all have the same flesh and are capable of 
the same sin. May God preserve us.
God’s Discipline
Chapter 12: Thank God that there was one brave prophet there, Nathan. 
It was a very dangerous thing in those days to confront a king and to tell 
him that he was a sinner. Even today, 99% of pastors would never dare 
to go to a church member who is rich, or a senior government official, 
and point out his sin to him. But Nathan was different. He came to David 
and told him a story: “There were two men in a city. One was rich and had 
many flocks of sheep. The other was a poor man who had only one little 
lamb. When a visitor came to the rich man’s house, the rich man wanted to 
make a lamb curry for him; but he didn’t take any of his own many lambs. 
Instead  he  took  that  poor  man’s  lamb,  and  killed  it  to  make  the  curry.” 
David’s anger burned greatly when he heard that (12:5). It is easy to get 
angry at the sins of others. Then Nathan said, “You are the man. You had 
so many wives. Uriah had only one, and you took her.” David suddenly 
realised the truth.
What had David said earlier when he heard Nathan’s story? He was so 
angry that he said “As the Lord lives, surely that man who has done this 
deserves to die” (12:5). The Law did not say that a man should be killed 
for stealing another person’s lamb. But David was stricter than the Law 
when it came to the sin of another. This is how we are too. We don’t see 
the greater sins in our own life. 
David had also said, “He must make restitution four times” (12:6). For 
taking that one lamb, the rich man must give four lambs back. That 
became the price David also had to pay for killing Uriah. Nathan told 
David,  “Therefore  the  sword  will  never  depart  from  your  house.  I  will  
raise up evil against you from your own household” (verses 10, 11). Four 
of David’s own sons had to die – the baby born to Bathsheba, Amnon, 
Absalom and Adonijah. We reap what we sow and our judgement will be 
according to what we ourselves have spoken. Jesus said that we would 
be judged with the same judgement with which we judged others. So it 
is wisest to be merciful to others and not to judge them.
And  here  you  see  a  man  after  God’s  own  heart  coming  into  his  own  
again.  David  said  to  Nathan,  “I  have  sinned  against  the  Lord”  (12:13), 
and  he  wrote  that  wonderful  psalm  –  Psalm  51.  “Lord,  I  have  sinned  

God’s Discipline                                                                                                                                         191
2 Samuel
against  You.  Please  don’t  take  Your  Holy  Spirit  away  from  me”  (Psalms 
51:4, 11). He didn’t try to cover up his sin like Saul. Saul had said, “Please 
honour me. Don’t let anybody know my sin” (1 Samuel 15:30). But David 
didn’t say that to Nathan. He wrote a Psalm and told everybody about it. 
That’s the wonderful thing we see about David. He didn’t pretend to be a 
spiritual person when he wasn’t. When he sinned he admitted it. 
What else can we learn from this incident? However great you may be 
before the Lord, when someone points out something wrong in your life, 
admit it. Don’t ever become so proud and arrogant that no-one can come 
to you and tell you that you are wrong, or that you need to change in some 
area. David humbled himself publicly and wrote Psalm 51, acknowledg-
ing his sin to the whole world, and asking for God’s mercy.
But  God  still  struck  Bathsheba’s  child  and  it  died,  despite  David’s  
repentance, confession, fasting and prayer. God deals with us in grace, 
forgiving us. But then He also deals with us in discipline. 
Let me give you one example of that: Consider a man who has filled his 
mind with pornographic literature and movies for many years. He then 
repents and asks God to forgive him. God forgives him immediately. The 
blood of Christ cleanses him thoroughly. God justifies him and looks at 
him  as  though  he  had  never  sinned.  Yet,  the  man  will  still  be  plagued  
with dirty, sexual images from his memory, for many, many years. Why 
doesn’t  God  remove  those  dirty  images  from  his  memory,  even  though  
He  has  cleansed  the  man’s  heart fully?  Because  through  the  recurring  
dirty images, the man will learn to be careful not to look at dirty pictures 
again, lest he be plagued with dirty dreams for many more years. If the 
dirty images were all removed by God, as soon as a man is forgiven, he 
would  be  more  easily  tempted  to  look  at  dirty  pictures  again,  knowing  
that the images could be erased easily. If, however, the man is faithful 
to resist those dirty thoughts, and to fill his mind with the Word of God 
regularly,  then  those  dirty  images  will  gradually  sink  to  the  bottom  of  
his memory. They will never go away totally. But they would have sunk 
so low that they don’t bother him in his dreams any more. Other pure 
thoughts  would  have  come  to  the  top  of  his  memory  and  those  will  be  
what he dreams about now. 
In Chapter 13, we read of Amnon “falling in love” with his half-sister 
Tamar and then forcibly molesting her. Once his lust had been satisfied, 
he hated her. It says that “the hatred with which he hated her was greater 
than the love with which he loved her” (verse 15). How did his “great love” 
for Tamar suddenly turn to hatred? Because what he called “love” was 
actually  just  “lust”.  Here  is  a  lesson  that  all  young  people  must  learn.  
Many  a  young  man  claims  to  “fall  in  love”  with  some  young  girl.  What 
both  of  them  don’t  realise  is  that  in  almost  all  cases,  the  young  man’s  
so-called “love” is actually only lust. Girls especially must recognise this 
and beware, lest they be exploited by young men. 
Human love always seeks its own gain. 

192 Through the Bible: The Reign of David
2 Samuel
Divine love is distinguished by the fact that it always seeks the good of 
the other. 
David could not rebuke his son Amnon for this sin – because he himself 
had done the same thing to Bathsheba! This is how many fathers lose 
their spiritual authority over their children.
Absalom’s Rebellion
Absalom then avenged his sister Tamar by killing Amnon. David finally 
began to reap in his own family what he had sown with Bathsheba and 
Uriah – adultery and murder. God is very exact in his judgements. Sooner 
or later, we begin to reap what we have sown.
In Chapter 15 we read about David’s son Absalom starting a conspir-
acy  because  he  wanted  to  be  king.  He  would  stand  at  the  gates  of  the  
city every morning and ask those who came in what their problems were. 
Then  he  would  tell  them  that  they  had  a  good  case,  but  unfortunately  
King  David  had  not  appointed  anyone  to  deal  with  such  matters.  And  
then he would tell them that if only he had been the ruler, he could have 
helped  everyone  so  quickly.  Thus  he  won  the  hearts  of  the  people  and  
stole them away from David.
We see that happening sometimes in Christian circles too – somebody 
steals the hearts of the people away from the leader because he wants 
to be the leader himself. Paul said to the elders in Ephesus, “I know 
that after my departure some of you will draw away disciples after your-
selves.” (Acts 20:29, 30) Absalom did that, but it never went well with 
Absalom.  And  it  never  goes  well  with  anyone  who  follows  Absalom’s  
ways today.
David had to leave his throne and flee for his life. But God brought 
something good out of that, for David wrote some psalms during this time 
when  he  was  in  the  wilderness  –  Psalms  55,  61  and  63.  These  psalms  
would never have been in the Bible, if Absalom had not chased David out 
of Jerusalem. But they have now become a blessing to millions of people 
for 3000 years. So the trials that God takes us through are the means by 
which God gives us a ministry to others.
Consider Psalm  55:22:  “Cast  your  burden  upon  the  Lord  and  He  will  
sustain you. He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.” David learnt 
to cast his burden on the Lord, while he was on the run, escaping for his 
life, and not when he was sitting comfortably in the palace. 
Many people switched sides as soon as Absalom began to rule. David 
had  a  trusted  counsellor  called  Ahithophel,  whose  words  David  had  
relied  on  as  if  it  were  the  word  of  God  itself  (16:23).  But  as  soon  as  
Absalom came to the throne, Ahithophel switched sides. Ahithophel was 
Bathsheba’s grandfather (compare 2 Samuel 23:34 with 11:3) and he was 

Absalom’s Rebellion                                                                                                                                 193
2 Samuel
waiting for an opportunity to avenge the evil that David had done to his 
grand-daughter. So he advised Absalom to commit adultery with David’s 
wives and thus humiliate David (16:21, 22).
Then  he  began  to  advise  Absalom  how  to  kill  David.  But  David  had  
already asked God in a brief one-sentence prayer to make the advice of 
Ahithophel foolishness (15:31). It is amazing what a one-sentence prayer 
can  do.  God  answered  it  –  and  Absalom  rejected  the  advice  given  by  
Ahithophel  and  took  the  opposite  advice  given  by  someone  else.  Thus  
David  escaped  being  killed.  So  don’t  ever  stop  praying  one-sentence  
prayers! Ahithophel, however, was a proud man and he was so offended 
by this that he went out and committed suicide (17:23).
When  David  was  running  away  from  Absalom,  a  man  called  Shimei  
came out of his house and threw stones at David and cursed him repeat-
edly (16:5). Shimei was a relative of Saul and had nursed a grudge against 
David for a long time, because David had replaced Saul on the throne of 
Israel. Shimei couldn’t do anything as long as David was on the throne. 
But now he shouted at David saying, “Get out of here, you murderer and 
scoundrel. The Lord is paying you back for murdering King Saul and his 
family.  You  stole  his  throne,  and  now  the  Lord  has  given  it  to  your  son  
Absalom. At last you will taste some of your own medicine, you murderer.” 
(verse 8 - Living). How little Shimei knew of the real truth. Even so is it 
with those who accuse the Lord’s servants today of many things.
One  of  David’s  soldiers  said,  “Let  me  go  and  chop  off  Shimei’s  head” 
(16:9). But David said, “No. If the Lord has told him (permitted him) to 
curse me, why should I fight against the Lord?” (16:10). It is wonder-
ful  to  see  David’s  understanding  of  the  absolute  sovereignty  of  God.  
He was convinced that no-one could speak against him, without God 
having given him permission. What rest can come into our lives, if only 
we understand this truth.
When Joab was going to battle against Absalom, David told him, “Deal 
gently for my sake with the young man” (18:5). These are the very words 
that the Lord would have us hear from Him, when we have to discipline 
some young person. The battle was finally won by David’s army. 
In 18:19–32,  we  read  of  a  young  man  named  Ahimaaz  who  wanted  
to be the first one to give the news of this victory to David, so that he 
could  get  some  honour  from  David.  But  Joab  sent  a  Cushite  instead  
to take the news. But Ahimaaz was persistent and finally Joab permit-
ted  him  to  go.  He  ran  so  fast  that  he  outran  the  Cushite  and  reached  
David first. But David was most interested to know if Absalom was alive. 
Unfortunately, Ahimaaz did not know. So he had to step aside and wait 
for the Cushite to come and tell David the news. This is a picture of two 
types of preachers – one who is eager to go and preach, but not sent by 

194 Through the Bible: The Reign of David
2 Samuel
God; the other one sent by God Himself. Only the one sent by God will 
have the full message – the full gospel – even if he comes in later, and is 
not as humanly “gifted” as the first one. There are many prophets like 
Ahimaaz today, who were never sent by God, who are “prophesying” and 
deceiving Christians. As believers, we must judge every “prophecy” and 
not blindly swallow everything we see and hear.
When David heard that Absalom had died, he wept saying, “O my son, 
my son Absalom. I wish I had died in your place” (18:33). There we see 
the Spirit of Christ in David, for he wished that he had died in place of 
those who had rebelled against him. David was a man who had traces 
of the new-covenant spirit in him, for he did not hate even those who 
planned to kill him.
Absalom  was  killed  and  David  was  brought  back  to  the  throne.  God  
had tested David when he was a young man, to see if he would grab the 
throne  from  Saul.  And  now  when  he  was  an  old  man,  God  tested  him  
again  to  see  if  he  would  grab  the  throne  from  Absalom.  In  both  cases,  
David waited for God to give him the throne. He never grabbed it himself. 
God will test us when we are young and He will test us when we are old 
– even after we have followed Him for 50 years. The first time, David had 
to be on the run for over 10 years. But the second time, he had to run for 
his life only for a few days. God determines how long each trial should be. 
And He will never allow us to be tested beyond our ability.
Last Days of David
In Chapter  21,  we  read  of  a  famine  in  Israel  that  continued  year  after  
year. For the first two years, David assumed that this was just a natural 
calamity. But when it continued into the third year as well, David began 
to seek the Lord to find out the reason for this. When we go through 
financial difficulties that never seem to end, or when we find a lack of the 
blessing of God upon our lives continuously, it is good for us to seek God’s 
face and find out the reason for it. There will always be a reason. In this 
case, God told David that it was because Saul had killed the Gibeonites 
many years earlier. The Gibeonites were Canaanites whom God Himself 
had  commanded  Joshua  to  kill.  But  Joshua  had  been  deceived  by  the  
Gibeonites, and had made a covenant with them that the Israelites would 
never kill any of them or their descendants. Saul violated this covenant. 
God takes it very seriously when we break our word – even to an enemy! 
Once the matter was set right, God blessed the land with crops again.
Chapter  22:  This  is  a  song  of  deliverance  that  is  repeated  word  for  
word in Psalm 18. Here is a beautiful picture of our salvation in verses 
17 to 20.

Last Days of David                                                                                                                                     195
2 Samuel
Chapter 23:2-4. David had been a great leader of Israel. Before he died, 
he wrote down a few words about the qualities that should be found 
in a spiritual leader of men. A leader should be anointed by the Holy 
Spirit and should have God’s Word on his tongue always. He must lead 
men righteously and in the fear of God. His life must be like a shining 
light and his testimony must be like a cloudless morning.
In Chapter 23:8–39, we have a list of some of the mighty men of David 
and their exploits. David was a brave man himself and he gathered many 
other brave men around him. God needs fearless leaders in the church 
today too, who will fight against Satan and through whom “the Lord can 
bring  about  great  victories”  –  if  necessary,  even  single-handedly (verses 
10, 12). The Lord needs men who “will take their stand” for Him boldly 
(verse 12). David had a large responsibility as ruler of Israel and he knew 
how to delegate responsibility to these brave men. He did not work alone. 
In Chapter 24, we read of the second serious sin that David committed. 
He decided to count the number of people in Israel – either to find out 
over how many people he was king or to see how strong his army would 
be. His general Joab (who knew the Lord less than him) urged him not 
to  do  it (verse  3).  But  David  was  stubborn  and  went  ahead  and  did  it  
anyway. The Lord punished him for it and 70,000 people were killed in 
Israel through sickness (verse 15). God was telling David that his census 
was  no  use,  because  God  could  reduce  the  population  in  one  day  by  
70,000 people! 
David  repented  and  decided  to  make  an  offering  to  the  Lord  in  the  
place where God told him to go – the threshing-floor of Araunah, which 
was on Mount Moriah where Abraham had offered up Isaac to God. As 
soon  as  Araunah  saw  the  king,  he  offered  David  all  the  bullocks  for  
sacrifice and the wood free of charge. But David refused the offer and 
said he would pay for it, saying, “I will never offer to the Lord that 
which costs me nothing” (24:24). This is a good motto for us to have 
all through our lives.
Here is a verse that all of you should remember throughout your life. 
Never give to God that which has cost you nothing.
It was on this very site that God commanded that the temple should be 
built, a few years later (2 Chronicles 3:1). The place where both Abraham 
and  David  had  offered  “that  which  cost  them  something”  was  the  
place God chose to build His house. 
It is the same today. God’s true house – the church – is built by people 
who have that spirit of sacrifice. Christendom is full of people who seek 
their own, who give to God that which costs them nothing, or very little. 
But God is looking for those who will have this attitude every day of their 
earthly lives: “I will never offer to God that which costs me nothing.” 
What has it cost you to serve the Lord?

his  book  begins  with  David,  the  man  after  God’s  own  heart,  and  
ends with Ahab, the worst king ever to rule over Israel. Israel begins 
as a powerful nation and ends as a divided nation, and with many 
evil kings ruling over both kingdoms – especially over Israel. 
As  we  have  repeatedly  seen,  the  condition  of  God’s  people  depends  
greatly on the spirituality or the lack of it in their leaders. Whenever 
Israel  had  a  godly  leader,  they  moved  forward  in  godly  ways.  When  
they  had  a  carnal  leader,  they  moved  away  from  God  into  carnality.  
The great need among God’s people has always been for godly leaders. 
Jesus looked out at the multitudes in His day and saw them as sheep 
without a shepherd. He told His disciples to pray that God would thrust 
forth shepherds into the midst of His people (Matthew 9:36–38). When 
God looks at the churches in India today, He sees the same need for 
godly  leaders.  The  challenge  that  comes  to  us  then  is  to  satisfy  the  
heart of God in our generation by being the type of men and women He 
is looking for.
In every generation God needs godly leaders. We cannot depend on the 
wisdom of the leaders of previous generations. David could not rule over 
Israel forever. He would die, and someone else would have to take over. 
What  would  become  of  Israel  depended  on  the  type  of  person  that  the  
next king would be. 
God  raises  up  a  godly  man  to  start  a  work  in  one  generation.  He  
becomes old and dies. Will the leaders in the next generation have only 
the founder’s knowledge and his doctrines, but not his godliness and 
his  knowledge  of  God?  Then  the  people  will  certainly  go  astray.  God  
needs many “David”s and “Deborah”s in our day.

David’s Last Days
As we look at the closing days of David, we see some sad things in his life. 
When  David  was  dying,  his  son  Adonijah  exalted  himself  and  said,  
“I  will  be  the  next  king”  (1:5).  He  was  not  like  his  father  David  who  
waited for God to make him king. Part of the reason was that David 
had never punished Adonijah even once in his entire life (verse 6). He 
had never used the rod on him and never even rebuked him when he 
did something wrong. 
Can you imagine what will happen to a child who grows up like that – 
especially if he is a good-looking child? David was a very poor father. We 
can  take  a  warning  for  ourselves  from  that.  David  was  so  busy  on  the  
battlefield that he had no time for his family. You  too  can  be  so  taken  
up with your work or your ministry that you don’t see how your children 
are growing up. It’s a sad thing if a man loses his children to the Devil, 
because he is “serving the Lord”. That is not the way to serve the Lord. 
David was lying on his death-bed and Adonijah was taking advantage 
of the fact that his father was now helpless; and so he made plans to take 
over the kingdom. Nathan the prophet went to Bathsheba as soon as he 
heard of that and told her to remind David about his promise to make 
Solomon his successor. Nathan also went and told David about Adonijah’s 
wicked  plan (verse  22). Thus  Nathan  the  prophet  brought  the  mind  of  
God into that situation. A church is so blessed when it has at least one 
genuine prophet, who can speak prophetically to it in a situation. 
David told the priests to anoint Solomon as king, and Zadok did that 
promptly (verses 32–34).
Chapter  2:  When  David  was  dying,  he  charged  Solomon  with  certain  
matters. But David’s last words are very disappointing. God’s Word is so 
honest when it tells us about the failures of His greatest servants. 
David should have told Solomon how to be a godly leader and how to 
honour God. He should have warned Solomon to be careful with women, 
and not to make the mistake he himself made of having more than one 
wife, etc. Instead what does he tell him? He tells him to kill Joab who had 
been David’s faithful and loyal general for so many years (2:5, 6). It is a 
pity that this was how David rewarded Joab. I think the reason for this 
was that David never really forgave Joab for killing his son Absalom, even 
though he mentions only Abner and Amasa here. 
Then David tells Solomon to kill Shimei, because he had cursed David 
(2:8, 9). At the time when Shimei cursed David, David had magnanimously 
said  that  he  didn’t  want  Shimei  killed,  because  it  was  God  Who  had  
allowed Shimei to curse him. And when David came back to Jerusalem, 
he had forgiven Shimei and promised not to harm him. But now he tells 
Solomon that the promise he made to Shimei was not binding on Solomon 
and so Solomon must make sure he is killed! David didn’t want to kill 

Solomon’s Initial Years                                                                                                                             199
1 Kings
Joab and Shimei himself. But he got them killed through Solomon. He 
was like those who hire gangsters to kill their enemies.
And what are the next words in 2:10: “Then David died.”
So those words of revenge were the last words he spoke before he died! 
That  is  sad.  David  had  started  his  life  so  well.  He  had  refused  to  kill  
Saul again and again (despite the repeated urgings of his friends). But 
now in the closing moments of his life, he is so eager to kill two people 
whom  he  claimed  to  have  forgiven.  It  is  obvious  from  this,  that  David  
had forgiven Joab and Shimei only externally. He must have nursed that 
grudge against them constantly and allowed his mind to dwell frequently 
on the evil that Shimei and Joab had done to him. As long as his mind 
was strong, he could keep up that pretence of having forgiven them. But 
as  he  grew  old  and  his  mind  began  to  weaken,  what  was  in  his  heart  
came out: He had never really forgiven them. What a warning for us!
But David lived under the old covenant, when God forgave even those 
who had not forgiven others. God permitted many things under the old 
covenant,  because  people’s  hearts  were  hard  (Matthew  19:8).  They  did  
not have the Holy Spirit within them. But under the new covenant, Jesus 
taught clearly and repeatedly that there would be no forgiveness for those 
who  did  not  forgive  others  right  from  their  hearts (Matthew  6:14,  15; 
18:35). Jesus even taught that sins that God had once forgiven would be 
put back into our account if we did not forgive all others “from our heart” 
(Matthew 18:22–35).
It’s quite possible that many people whom you think you have forgiven, 
you may not have really forgiven. The Bible speaks about the danger 
of having a root of bitterness (Hebrews 12:15). An unforgiving attitude 
can develop roots of bitterness very quickly. So go through the list of 
those  who  have  harmed  you  and  make  sure  that  you  have  radically  
pulled out every root of bitterness against every one of them; otherwise 
you will destroy yourself. Pull out those roots now when your mind is 
strong, and not when you are on your deathbed. One day you may be 
senile and too weak to do anything about those roots.
Solomon’s Initial Years
Chapter 2: Solomon began his reign by killing his step-brother Adonijah 
(verses 19–27), his first-cousin Joab (verses 28–35), and Shimei (verses 
36–46). What a way to start one’s reign! And to think that it was David, 
the man after God’s own heart, who had suggested all this to Solomon, 
and  thus  started  him  off  on  the  pathway  of  destruction!  Such  is  the  
long-term result of un-cleansed bitterness, by which many are defiled. 
But Solomon still imagined that God would bless him in spite of all this 
(verses 45). How deceived can a person get!
Chapter 3: Once you start out on the wrong path, you go further and 
further away from God! The next thing that Solomon did was get married 

200 Through the Bible: The Kings of Israel and Judah
1 Kings
to a heathen woman – Pharaoh’s daughter. If only David had spent his 
last days advising Solomon on marrying wisely, instead of teaching him 
how  to  take  revenge,  what  a  different  turn  things  might  have  taken  in  
Solomon’s  life.  What  advice  do  you  give  your  children?  What  are  the  
things that are most important to you in life? 
 We read that “Solomon ‘loved the Lord’, except that he sacrificed and 
burned incense on the high places” (3:3). What a contradiction! Solomon 
finally destroyed himself because of such compromise. He lived a double-
life – one in the temple and one in private. Unfortunately, that is also how 
many  Christians  live  today.  They  make  many  loud  expressions  of  love  
for the Lord; but in private, they live in unrighteousness and sin. Finally 
their little backslidings become big ones and destroy them. 
Yet  God  was  good  to  Solomon,  for  He  wanted  him  to  change.  He  
appeared  to  Solomon  one  night  and  told  him,  “Whatever  you  want  I  
will give it to you” (verse 5). And Solomon asked saying, “Give me an 
understanding heart. Give me largeness of heart to take in all of God’s 
people. Give me a heart to judge Your people to discern between good 
and evil, because it’s so difficult to judge” (verse 9).
The Lord was happy with what he asked and told him, “Because you 
did not ask for long life or for riches or for the life of your enemies, I have 
given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there is no one like you 
nor shall anyone like you arise after you. I have also given you riches 
and honour and there will be no king like you” (3:10–13).
The great need among Christian leaders today is for discernment, and 
only God can give it to us. Those who are leaders need discernment about 
the true state of the brothers and sisters in their church –  especially when 
giving responsibility to any of them. If Solomon got it by asking God, why 
can’t we get it as well? Doesn’t God love us much more under the new 
covenant? Doesn’t He have a far greater concern about the church we are 
building than He had for Solomon ruling Israel? He certainly does. So, 
if we lack discernment, perhaps it is because, in our self-sufficiency, we 
have failed to ask Him for it.
Two Women and a Baby
Chapter  3:16–28:  Here  we  have  an  example  of  Solomon’s  wisdom.  Two  
prostitutes  stood  before  him  for  judgement  one  day.  They  were  living  in  
the same house and had delivered babies within a few days of each other. 
One  night,  one  of  them  accidentally  rolled  over  her  child  while  sleeping,  
and  killed  it.  When  she  realised  what  had  happened,  she  immediately  
exchanged her baby with the living one. In the morning, when the other 
woman  realised  what  had  been  done,  she  claimed  her  living  child  back.  

Two Women and a Baby                                                                                                                          201
1 Kings
An  argument  arose  between  them  then,  as  to  whom  the  living  child  
belonged to. How was Solomon going to decide in a situation like this? God 
gave Solomon wisdom. Solomon suggested that the living child be divided 
into two, and one half given to each woman. The first woman whose child 
it really was, said, “No, please don’t kill it. Give it to the other woman.” But 
the second woman said, “No, kill it. You can have half and I can have half.” 
Immediately everyone knew who the true mother was. Then Solomon said, 
“Give the child to the first woman.” All Israel heard of that judgement and 
feared the king because they saw how God had given him wisdom.
Here is how we can apply Solomon’s wisdom today: Suppose two broth-
ers are working together in a church and they fall out with each other. 
One of them then splits it into two and pulls out with his group. Is he 
the true mother? Certainly not. The true mother would say, “No. Don’t 
divide the church. You can have the whole church to yourself.” 
Don’t ever split a church of believers. It is far better to leave the church 
intact,  pull  out  yourself,  go  elsewhere  and  start  an  entirely  new  work,  
without causing a split in the first church. God will bless you. If God 
wants to give you that church to lead, because you are the true mother, 
He  can  even  kill  the  other  woman  one  day  and  give  you  the  child.  He  
killed Saul and gave the kingdom to David. He can do such things today 
too. But don’t ever cut a living baby into two. Don’t divide a church. Go 
and  work  somewhere  else.  Let  God  give  you  everything  from  His  own  
hand. Don’t ever grab or divide.
That’s  the  principle  I  have  followed,  whenever  I  have  disagreed  with  
a  church’s  leadership.  I  didn’t  try  to  split  the  church,  to  get  some  of  
them  to  follow  me.  I  went  elsewhere  and  said,  “Lord,  let  me  start  from  
the beginning all over again. Give me another child. I won’t fight for that 
one.” And I can testify today that God has blessed me abundantly in my 
work, because of that attitude. So I would recommend that to you.
In  4:29  (KJV),  we  read.  “God  gave  Solomon  wisdom and  very  great  
discernment and breadth of mind, largeness of heart, like the sand 
that is on the seashore”. Remember Solomon was a very young man. So 
young people can ask God to give them all these four gifts mentioned 
here.  Not  only  wisdom,  discernment  and breadth  of  mind  but  also  
“largeness of heart, like the sand that is on the seashore”. This means 
(for us) a large heart that can take in all of God’s people who are like 
the sand on the seashore (Genesis 22:17). 
Consider  a  brother  who  belongs  to  another  denomination,  who  
dis  agrees  with  us  about  water-baptism  or  about  speaking  in  tongues.  
But God has accepted him. Our prayer should be, “Lord, give me large-
ness of heart to warmly receive him – even if he doesn’t work with me or 
agree with me.” I want as many brothers and sisters as God has children!

202 Through the Bible: The Kings of Israel and Judah
1 Kings
Consider a child of God who has a conviction on some matter that is 
different from ours. Can we accept that person? I remember once when a 
sister came to me for baptism and she was wearing some gold jewellery. 
Now, I have a conviction that gold should not be worn by believers. That 
is my understanding of 1 Timothy 2:9 and 1 Peter 3:3. And this sister was 
wearing gold. Would I baptise her or not? The Lord asked me one question 
at that time: “Would you say that I have accepted her?” And I said, “Lord, 
as far as I can see, she is truly born again and so you have accepted her.” 
Then the Lord said, “How can you reject one whom I have accepted?” So I 
baptised her – with her gold! She may get light on that matter later. But it 
is not my business to judge her. I want to accept all those whom God has 
accepted – even if their convictions are different from mine.
I remember once concerning some issue, the Lord asked me, “How long 
did you take to understand this matter?” I admitted that it had taken 
me some years. Then why couldn’t I be patient with that person who 
was taking time to understand the issue? 
We  all  need  largeness  of  heart. When  we  are  young,  we  tend  to  be  
zealous and narrow-minded, narrow-hearted, and we accept only those 
who agree with us on every issue. I am ashamed to say that I was like 
that when I was young. It was one of the many foolish attitudes I had. 
But as I grew older and knew the Lord better I discovered that I needed 
to have largeness of heart.
In 6:7, we read something beautiful about how the temple was built. 
The temple was built of stones that were cut and shaped far away – in 
the quarry where they were cut out from the hillside. So when the stones 
were brought to the building site, they had already been perfectly shaped 
on all six sides, so that there was no sound of chipping at the temple-site 
itself. This is how the church must be built too. We must judge ourselves 
in secret in our private life so that when we come together, there is no 
sound of conflict or strife!
Solomon’s Backsliding
Solomon took seven years to build the Lord’s temple (6:38), and thirteen 
years to build his own house (7:1). So we know which he valued more!! 
That is a fairly good description of many people who are doing Christian 
work today. They do “Christian” work all right. But their primary interest 
is in their own house and the comfort of their own family. God’s work and 
God’s house are secondary. Preaching the gospel has made them rich. 
Solomon’s backsliding was gradual – as all backsliding is. He started 
off  his  rule  by  killing  people.  He  could  have  easily  disagreed  with  his  
father David, and refused to kill Shimei and Joab. He could have forgiven 
Adonijah  and  not  killed  him.  Once  he  had  started  sliding  down,  the  

Solomon’s Backsliding                                                                                                                              203
1 Kings
gradient  became  steeper.  Next,  he  married  Pharaoh’s  daughter  –  obvi-
ously  for  her  wealth.  Then  he  spent  thirteen  years  building  his  own  
house. All this, in spite of the fact that God had given him such wisdom! 
Many a time, I have seen in Christian workers, a drift towards the world 
right from the beginning of their lives. They start seeking their own right 
from the time they begin their ministry. When you see them years later, 
they have become experts in seeking their own.
But God still loved His people, in spite of the backsliding of their king. 
So He filled the temple with His glory when it was completed (8:10, 11). 
It was just like the day when Moses had completed the tabernacle. The 
temple was built in the same pattern as the tabernacle, but on a much 
bigger and grander scale.
Solomon  prayed  a  beautiful  prayer  of  dedication  (8:22–61).  The  Lord  
then appeared to him a second time and told him that He had heard 
his  prayer  and  again  urged  him  to  walk  in  integrity  of  heart  and  
uprightness, so that his kingdom would be established. He also warned 
Solomon that if he turned away from following the Lord, Israel would 
be  removed  from  the  land  and  the  temple  would  become  a  heap  of  
ruins (9:3–9).
That  was  exactly  what  happened  when  the  Babylonians  came  and  
captured Judah and destroyed the temple. God had warned them, “Don’t 
think you can live as you like and that I will just keep on blessing you.” 
The Lord warns us long before we start going astray. 
In Chapter  10  we  read  of  the  Queen  of  Sheba  coming  and  meeting  
Solomon because she had heard of his wonderful wisdom. But despite all 
his worldwide reputation for wisdom, Solomon was a mixed-up man. He 
could pray beautiful prayers to the Lord in public, like most Christians. 
But  in  his  private  life,  he  was  as  godless  as  anyone  –  again  like  many  
Christians. He rivalled Samson in lust – for he married 700 wives and as 
if that were not enough, he kept 300 concubines as well – mostly from 
the  heathen  nations  around  him  (11:1–3).  He  must  have  seen  each  of  
them just once in three years! Those wives finally turned him away from 
the Lord, to the worship of idols.
When  you  plan  to  get  married,  don’t  just  look  for  a  pretty  face.  See  
whether the girl has a desire to live a godly life. That is far more impor-
tant  in  the  long  run.  A  woman  who  has  only  a  pretty  face  can  ruin  
your life and destroy it. A godly woman will however do you good all 
the  days  of  your  life.  There  are  many  warnings  in  Scripture.  But  I  
don’t know whether you will take heed to them when the time comes. 
Many nod their heads when they hear such things in the meetings. But 
when the time comes for their marriage, they still choose a worldly girl, 
just  because  she  is  good-looking.  And  sisters,  let  me  urge  you  also:  

204 Through the Bible: The Kings of Israel and Judah
1 Kings
Pray that God will lead you to a godly man to be your husband. Don’t 
yield to the suggestions of your parents, if they suggest an unconverted 
person. Your partner can lead you astray to the worship of idols – the 
idols of money, pleasure and godless entertainment, etc.
When  Solomon  went  astray,  God  was  angry  with  him  and  told  him  
that He would divide his kingdom into two (11:9–11). But because David 
was a godly man, God did not do it in Solomon’s lifetime (11:12). There 
we see how much children are blessed because of the godliness of their 
fathers! God raised up enemies to trouble Solomon, but he still did not 
repent (11:14). When Solomon feared that Jeroboam was going to rebel 
against  him,  he  tried  to  put  Jeroboam  to  death  (11:26,  40).  Jeroboam  
later became king of the divided kingdom. Thus Solomon died (11:43).
Solomon wrote three books in Scripture in his lifetime – two of them 
– Proverbs and Song of Solomon – are like new covenant books in the 
Old Testament. Proverbs is the finest book in the Old Testament. All 
young people should read it regularly and frequently. It has 31 chap-
ters. Read a chapter a day and it can preserve you from much evil.
Song of Solomon is a wonderful picture of our devotion to Jesus Christ 
as His bride.
Ecclesiastes was written after Solomon had drifted. In it, he warns us 
about the dangers of worldly wisdom.
This man who wrote three wonderful books of the Bible finally went to 
hell! Don’t imagine that everyone who stands up and preaches wonderful 
sermons will go to heaven.
How do we know that Solomon went to hell? Is it possible that the Holy 
Spirit would write two biographies of Solomon (1 Kings and 2 Chronicles), 
and  not  mention  in  either  of  them  that  he  repented  towards  the  end  
of his life, if he had actually done so? Such silence is very eloquent. It 
tells us that Solomon died unrepentant. Manasseh was a king who did 
much greater evil than Solomon, and for a much longer period of time. 
But at the end of his life he repented, and the Holy Spirit mentions it in 
Scripture (2 Chronicles 33:12, 13). It is unthinkable that the Holy Spirit 
would not have mentioned it, if Solomon had repented. 
Why  are  many  Christians  so  keen  on  “sending  Solomon  to  heaven”? 
It’s because they imagine that anyone who serves the Lord will defi-
nitely go to heaven, irrespective of how they live. Jesus said that many 
would come to Him on the last day and say, “Lord, we prophesied in 
Your Name, we cast out demons in Your Name, we did miracles in Your 
Name.” But the Lord will say to them, “Depart from me, you who lived 

The Divided Kingdom                                                                                                                               205
1 Kings
in sin” (Matthew 7:22, 23). Solomon will come before the Lord in that 
day  too  and  say,  “Lord,  I  wrote  three  books  of  Scripture  that  blessed  
millions of people.” And the Lord will tell him also exactly what He tells 
the others, “Depart from me, you who lived in sin.” Let Solomon’s life be 
a warning to all of us. Paul said, “I can preach to others, but be disqual-
ified myself finally” (1 Corinthians 9:27). 
The Divided Kingdom
From Chapter 12 onwards to the end of 1 Kings, we read about the divided 
kingdom. Solomon had been a very cruel king who had made people work 
hard to build his palace and to serve him in many other ways. So when 
his son Rehoboam came to the throne, some of the people came to him 
and said, “Your father has made our yoke hard. Now please lighten our 
yoke.” (12:4). The king asked them to come back after three days. During 
those three days, Rehoboam consulted with the elders who told him to 
be kind to his subjects and they would serve him happily forever. Then 
he consulted with the young people and they told him to be still harder 
on the people and to tell them, “My little finger is going to be thicker than 
my father’s loins. If my father disciplined you with whips, I will discipline 
you with scorpions” (12:11). Like many other stupid people after him, he 
listened to the young people and not to the elders. The result was that 
he lost 85% of his kingdom. Ten tribes broke away from him. What a fool 
Rehoboam was! He split his kingdom by speaking one foolish sentence.
The tribes of Judah and Benjamin (in the south) alone remained loyal 
to Rehoboam. Jeroboam became the king of the other ten tribes in the 
north,  who  called  themselves  Israel.  Jeroboam  now  realised  that  he  
might  lose  his  hold  over  his  people  if  they  went  to  Jerusalem  thrice  a  
year as required for their annual feasts, and mingled with the people of 
the southern kingdom. To stop their going to Jerusalem, he built a place 
of worship in Shechem, so that the people could have their feasts there. 
He installed an idol there and got everyone involved in idol-worship.
Chapter 13: Here we read of a young prophet who was given a message 
of judgement against King Jeroboam. He went and delivered it faithfully 
and the Lord confirmed his prophecy supernaturally to the king. The 
king then invited the prophet home for a meal and for a reward. But the 
Lord  had  earlier  told  the  prophet  not  to  eat  or  drink  anything  until  he  
returned home. The young prophet was faithful to the Lord’s command 
and told the king that even if he were given half the kingdom, he would 
not go home with him. What a faithful man he was. If only he had contin-
ued like that!
But there was an old prophet living in the area, who heard about what 
happened,  and  was  disturbed  that  God  had  picked  a  younger  man  to  
give  this  powerful  message  to  the  king.  And  he  was  jealous.  He  went  
and met the younger prophet and told him a lie that “the Lord had told 

206 Through the Bible: The Kings of Israel and Judah
1 Kings
him”  to  invite  the  younger  prophet  home  for  a  meal.  The  young  man,  
like  a  fool,  instead  of  obeying  the  Lord’s  original  command,  listened  to  
the  old  prophet  and  went  and  ate  with  him,  imagining  that  the  Lord  
had changed His mind without informing him!! For his disobedience, the 
young prophet was punished by the Lord. He was slain by a lion.
What lesson are we to learn from this for ourselves? There are many 
retired  “prophets”  today,  who  are  jealous  of  younger  prophets,  and  
may often seek to destroy them. Young prophets must beware of such 
retired backslidden “prophets”. Be careful of anyone who says to you, 
“The Lord told me to tell you this....” Don’t believe them. If God wants 
to give you a word, He will give it to you directly – for He has given you 
His Holy Spirit, unlike old covenant times. 
Elijah and His Ministry
In Chapter 17 we read about Elijah. 
The first thing I want you to notice about Elijah are his words to King 
Ahab: “As the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand” (17:1). 
These true prophets did not fear kings because of one reason: They stood 
before  the  Lord.  Kings  were  mere  specks  of  dust  before  God.  The  great  
need in India is for young men who can be prophets like that. Knowledge 
of the Bible is important. But more important than that is this: You must 
live  before  God’s  face.  To  live  before  God’s  face,  you  must  keep  your  
conscience  100%  clear  –  not  99%,  but  100%.  And  you  must  humble  
yourself totally. Your face must be in the dust all the time. That’s how 
Elijah lived.
If God can’t find young men like that, I hope He will find some young 
sisters who live before God’s face and be a voice for Him in India. You may 
not stand in a pulpit, but you can influence people from your homes. God 
needs many brothers and sisters in our land who live before His face.
Elijah was a man who was instantly obedient to every little thing that 
God  said.  God  told  him  one  day  to  go  and  hide  himself  by  the  brook  
Cherith – and he went at once (17:3). There the ravens brought him bread 
and  meat  and  he  drank  from  the  brook  (verse  6).  Every  morning  and  
evening a raven would bring him some meat. If the ravens had brought 
him vegetables, that itself would have been a miracle. But for a raven to 
bring meat (which it loves) is a greater miracle. That’s how God provided 
for Elijah. But after a few days, Elijah may have begun to depend on the 
ravens and not on the Lord!
Many servants of the Lord start out trusting the Lord for their financial 
needs. But after a few years, they are no longer depending on the Lord, 
but on some ravens – human beings who send them regular support! 
So the brook dried up and the Lord stopped the ravens. God wanted to 

Elijah and His Ministry                                                                                                                             207
1 Kings
shake off Elijah’s dependence on brooks and ravens and to teach him 
once again to depend on the Lord alone. Thank God when the ravens 
stop coming – when the promised support doesn’t come. Then you will 
learn once again to trust the Lord alone for your needs. I have been 
through experiences like that. I thank God for the times when He has 
turned  away  my  eyes  from  ravens  to  Him  Who  owns  “the  cattle  on  a  
thousand hills” (Psalms 50:10), and Who has said that He will supply 
all  my  needs  “according  to  His  riches  in  glory  through  Christ  Jesus” 
(Philippians 4:19).
The  Lord  then  changed  His  method  and  told  Elijah  now  to  go  to  
Zarephath.  Zarephath  was  outside  Israel.  Elijah  may  have  imagined  
that some rich businessman there would take care of him. But when he 
reached Zarephath, what he found was not a rich businessman, but a 
poor widow who was just about to have her last meal! And the Lord told 
Elijah, “She will support you”! God’s ways are truly amazing. God does 
things  like  that,  because  He  is  a  jealous  God.  He  wants  us  to  trust  in  
Him, and not in ravens or rich businessmen. He will use a weak person 
whom you least expect to be able to help you, and use him, so that no 
flesh may glory in His presence (1 Corinthians 1:29).
The  widow  said,  “We  were  just  about  to  have  our  last  meal  and  die” 
(17:12).  Elijah  told  her,  “Don’t  be  afraid.  Make  me  a  little  bread  cake  
from it first. The bowl of flour shall not be exhausted nor shall the jar of 
oil be empty, until the day the Lord sends rain on the face of the earth.” 
(17:13, 14). And the bowl of flour was not exhausted and the jar of oil 
did not become empty. 
There are many preachers today who use this incident to teach poor 
people to give them money. But that is a total misinterpretation of this 
incident. First  of  all,  most  of  today’s  preachers  are  not prophets  like  
Elijah. Secondly, most of today’s preachers are lovers of money, unlike 
Elijah. These two facts alone put Elijah in a totally different class from 
today’s preachers who exploit the poor. Further, Elijah asked the widow 
for just a bare meal to survive in a time of famine; and he ate the same 
food  that  the  widow  and  her  son  ate.  Today’s  preachers  are  asking  for  
money, not for survival, but to support their grand lifestyles. And finally, 
while Elijah took only one meal from that widow, he provided meals for 
her and her son, for many, many months – until the famine ended. So 
she received a hundred times more than she gave to the prophet. Which 
preacher does that today? There are multitudes of false prophets around 
today. Unfortunately,  since  most  of  God’s  people  do  not  know  how  to  
distinguish between a true prophet and a false one, they are deceived. 
In Chapter  18,  we  read  about  a  man  called  Obadiah.  He  was  the  
manager of Ahab’s palace and it is written that “he feared the Lord greatly” 

208 Through the Bible: The Kings of Israel and Judah
1 Kings
(verse 3). This only means that he was a religious person. It is written of 
others also in 2 Kings 17:33 that “they feared the Lord and served their 
own  gods”.  I  cannot  understand  how  anyone  can  truly  fear  the  Lord,  
and still live as the manager of a wicked idol-worshipping king’s palace. 
Obadiah was obviously seeking a comfortable life for himself along with 
his religion. There are a lot of people like that. They don’t want to pay the 
price of discipleship. Joseph of Arimathea was like that. He didn’t want to 
leave the Jewish Sanhedrin and become a despised disciple of Jesus. He 
knew that Jesus was the Messiah but he wanted to follow Him secretly, 
because he sought the honour of men. Such believers can never become 
apostles. But they still serve some purpose. When Jesus’ body had to be 
taken down from the cross, Joseph’s influence in Pilate’s palace was of 
value. So Obadiah also was of help to some of the Lord’s prophets.
We read then about the challenge that Elijah gave to Israel. “Call every-
body to Mount Carmel,” Elijah told Ahab (verse 19). Although Ahab was 
the  king,  he  feared  Elijah.  So  he  did  what  he  was  told  and  called  the  
Israelites to Mount Carmel. Then Elijah told the 450 prophets of Baal, 
“Let’s choose an ox each and make an altar without any fire under it. Then 
you call on your god and ask him to send fire. And I will call on my God. 
The one who answers by fire, let Him be the true God.” All the people said, 
“That’s a good idea. Let’s do that” (18:23, 24).
Then the prophets of Baal put the ox on the altar and began to jump 
and shout and scream. Nothing happened. It is good to note here that 
many “Christians” who jump and shout and scream can be just as carnal 
or unconverted as these Baal-worshippers! Elijah mocked them and said, 
“Shout louder. Perhaps he is asleep and needs to be woken up. Or perhaps 
he is in the toilet!” (18:27). They cried louder still and cut themselves and 
raved for over six hours. But nothing happened.
How  many  hours  they  prayed!  I  sometimes  think  of  these  Baal-
worshippers when I see Christians who don’t have a good conscience 
shouting  Hallelujahs;  when  brothers  who  are  not  on  talking  terms  
stand  in  the  same  meeting  and  praise  God  with  loud  voices;  when  
husbands  and  wives  who  have  fought  with  each  other  come  to  the  
Sunday meeting and speak in tongues, etc. Many Christian meetings 
have  a  lot  of  noise,  but no fire.  You  can  shout  for  six  hours,  or  even  
have an all night prayer meeting. But nothing happens, because God 
looks for a good conscience. I always tell Christians, “Before you start 
praying, make sure that God has picked up the telephone and is listen-
ing. If you have sin in your heart, God will not hear you.” (Psalms 66:18).
Then  it  was  Elijah’s  turn.  He  picked  up  12  stones  to  make  an  altar.  
Remember that the people of Israel were divided now – 10 tribes in one 
nation and 2 in another. But Elijah did not believe in nations or in denom-
inations – and so he picked up 12 stones. He believed in the unity of all 
of God’s people. Some who were there may have been upset with him for 

Elijah and His Ministry                                                                                                                             209
1 Kings
including  the  tribes  of  Benjamin  and  Judah  as  well.  But  Elijah  didn’t  
care for their opinion.
To prove that there was no secret fire under his altar, he asked for 
12 pitchers of water to be poured on the altar. Then he prayed – for less 
than a minute. “O Lord let it be known that Thou art God and that I am 
Thy servant” (18:36). The fire fell and all the people fell on their faces and 
acknowledged that the Lord was the true God. With all Israel now on his 
side, Elijah caught the 450 prophets of Baal and killed them all.
The fire from heaven alone is the identifying mark of a true servant of 
God. This is what we need today to turn God’s people back to him.
Now that the people had repented, Elijah told Ahab that the rain would 
soon be on its way. There had been no rain for 3½ years. Elijah then went 
to the mountain top and began to pray. He crouched down to the earth, 
put his face between his knees and prayed (verse 42). He sent his servant 
to see if there was any rain coming. There was none. He sent his servant 
back again and again – seven times. At last, there was a cloud. 
Here  we  see  Elijah’s  persistence  in  prayer.  “Elijah  was  a  man  with  a  
nature like ours. And he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it did 
not rain on the earth for three years and six months. And he prayed again, 
and the sky poured rain.” (James 5:17, 18). The earlier drought too had 
been the result of Elijah’s persistent prayer. And now the rain came also 
as a result of his persistent prayer. His example of persistence in prayer 
is a challenge to all of us. Many a time, we have not received what God 
has wanted us to have, because we have given up praying too soon.
Then  he  got  up  from  prayer,  and  in  the  supernatural  power  of  God,  
ran six miles to Jezreel, in front of Ahab’s chariot, outrunning the horses 
(verse 46). 
When Jezebel heard that all her false prophets had been killed, she got 
very angry and sent a message to Elijah that she would kill him next. The 
mighty prophet who was not afraid of the king, or of 850 false prophets, 
or of the whole nation, now cowered in fear at the threat of one woman. 
How very much like us he was.
Isn’t it good that the Bible tells us honestly about the weaknesses and 
failures of its greatest men? I praise God for that. God did not pick up 
supermen, but ordinary men to serve Him. 
Elijah had lived through 3½ years of famine and was now exhausted. 
All this made him very discouraged, and he ran away from Israel to the 
mountains and lay down under a juniper tree (19:5). An angel came 
from heaven. The angel did not give Elijah an exhortation, but some 
food. He slept again and woke up. Again the angel gave him food. God 
is very “down to earth” and practical in the way He helps us. Many a 
time, what a discouraged man needs is some food and sleep. A little 
encouragement, a little food and a small gift can encourage people far 
more than many sermons. We need wisdom to be able to help others.

210 Through the Bible: The Kings of Israel and Judah
1 Kings
However, Elijah was under the old covenant. His discouragement is not 
a pattern for us to get comfort from. Today, we run the race, looking not 
at Elijah, but at Jesus, Who was never discouraged. We need never be 
discouraged at any time. It all depends on whom we follow.
Elijah imagined that he alone was left in Israel standing for God and 
asked  God  to  take  away  his  life  (19:10,  4).  But  the  Lord  showed  him  
that there were others beside him in Israel. In fact, the Lord had already 
prepared someone to take over as the next prophet after him. Elijah was 
to anoint Elisha to take over from him (19:16). The Lord also told Elijah 
that there were 7000 people in Israel who had refused to bow down to 
Baal (19:18). So God had a remnant in the nation.
There was a vast difference however between those 7000 and Elijah. It 
is true that they did not bow the knee to Baal. But none of them could 
bring God’s fire down from heaven and turn the nation back to Him. 
Only Elijah could do that. This is a picture of two types of believers: 
One group whose testimony is negative – they don’t worship idols, they 
don’t smoke, they don’t drink, etc. The other, like Elijah, whose testi-
mony is positive: They stand before God and are aflame with the fire 
of  God.  One  uncompromising  prophet  can  accomplish  more  for  God  
today than 7000 half-hearted believers.
Chapter  19:19–21:  Here  we  read  of  Elijah  calling  Elisha.  Elisha  was  
working hard in the fields with his oxen, when Elijah called him. 
Notice first of all,  that  God  always  calls  those  who  are  working  hard  
and  faithful  in  their  secular  occupations.  Moses  was  faithfully  looking  
after his father-in-law’s sheep when God called him. David was looking 
after sheep and fighting with lions and bears. Amos was a hard-working 
herdsman. Peter, James, John and Andrew were hard-working fisher-
men. Matthew was sitting at the table working on his accounts. We never 
see,  anywhere  in  the  Old  Testament  or  the  New  Testament,  that  God  
called a lazy man for his service. 
We don’t find Elijah going to Elisha’s house when he was fast asleep 
and  calling  him  there  –  because  we  would  have  thought  he  was  a  lazy  
man. Jesus also never went to Peter’s house in the evening to call him. 
He called him when he was fishing. All these examples show us that God 
wants us to be faithful and hard-working in our secular jobs, before He 
can call us to serve Him. If you are not faithful in earthly matters, how 
can you be faithful in heavenly matters? If you are young and still living 
at home, then be a faithful son or daughter at home.
Notice secondly,  that  all  these  men  dropped  everything  and  went,  as  
soon  as  God  called  them.  We  see  that  with  Peter,  John  and  Matthew,  
and also here with Elisha. God calls those who will respond to His call 

Elijah and His Ministry                                                                                                                             211

immediately and wholeheartedly. They may seek to confirm God’s call on 
their lives through godly people, in order to be certain that they are not 
acting on their own emotional feelings. But once they are sure, they act 
quickly. God can use only such people to serve Him, because His service 
requires  instant  obedience,  total  commitment  and  hard  work.  So  God  
tests us in our secular occupations, to see whether we are faithful. If you 
are asked to clean a room and you are careless or slipshod about the way 
you do it, I doubt if God will ever call you to serve Him. Because, if that’s 
the way you clean up a room, that will probably be the way you clean up 
your heart as well. How then can God use you to clean up His church? 
It is faithfulness in the little things that God looks for.
In Chapter 21, we read of a man called Naboth who was a neighbour 
of Ahab. Naboth had a vineyard that Ahab wanted to buy. But Naboth 
refused to sell it, according to God’s law (Leviticus 25:23). Jezebel, however, 
got Naboth falsely accused and killed, and thus Ahab took possession of 
the vineyard. The fearless Elijah now confronted Ahab at God’s direction, 
and told him that God would judge him for killing Naboth and that the 
dogs would lick Ahab’s blood one day, and his family would be destroyed. 
Ahab  was  scared  and  tore  his  clothes  and  fasted  (verse  27).  Then  God  
told Elijah that He would have mercy on Ahab and send the judgement 
on his family only in the next generation. It is amazing to see how merci-
ful  God  is.  God  values  humility  so  greatly  that  even  when  Ahab  (who  
was  so  wicked)  humbled  himself,  God  took  notice  of  it  and  suspended  
judgement.
In Chapter  22,  we  read  about  the  foolishness  of  Judah’s  king,  
Jehoshaphat.  Ahab  asked  him  to  join  him  in  a  battle  against  king  of  
Aram. Jehoshaphat agreed immediately and then decided to seek God’s 
will about it, after agreeing (22:4, 5). Ahab immediately rounded up 400 
false prophets who readily “prophesied” that the Lord would give them 
the victory (22:6). It is amazing to see so soon after God’s fire fell, false 
prophets arising again in Israel! It has been like that throughout the ages. 
False prophets and preachers have abounded everywhere in every gener-
ation to lead people astray. But Jehoshaphat had enough discernment 
to  recognise  that  none  of  these  400  were  genuine  prophets.  Ahab  said  
that there was one more prophet Micaiah – but Ahab hated him because 
Micaiah always prophesied judgement against Ahab. Micaiah was called, 
and he predicted the defeat of Israel’s army. Ahab was so angry with him 
that he locked him up in prison. Jehoshaphat foolishly still joined Ahab, 
even though God had spoken. He almost lost his life, because the enemy 
thought he was the king of Israel. Ahab disguised himself to avoid being 
killed. But he could not escape God’s judgement for a stray arrow that 
was fired came and killed him – and the dogs licked his blood, as God 
had said (21:19; 22:38). 
This book began with David ruling a united Israel and ends with the 
nation divided into two, and in a backslidden condition – with a wicked 

212 Through the Bible: The Kings of Israel and Judah
1 Kings
Ahab ruling one part and a compromising Jehoshaphat ruling the other. 
We also see in this book the tremendous effect that a single prophet can 
have on a nation. God needs prophets today in the church. They alone 
can arrest the downward trend among the people of God.

Corruption in Israel and Judah
T
his book contains the remaining part of the story of the two nations 
–  Israel  and  Judah  –  and  the  kings  that  ruled  them.  In  Israel,  
almost all the kings were bad. In Judah, some were good. We also 
read here of how both nations went into captivity. The Assyrians came 
and captured the northern kingdom of Israel in about 730 B.C. Some of 
the Assyrians intermarried with the Jews in Samaria, and that’s how the 
Samaritans were born, whom the other Jews did not have any dealings 
with (in Jesus’ time).
About 150 years later, the southern kingdom of Judah was captured by 
Babylon (which became the next world power after Assyria). The tragedy 
was that Judah did not learn any lessons from the failure of Israel. 
A wise man learns from the mistakes of others. A foolish man never 
learns. God’s Word has been given to us so that we can become wise. 
One way to become wise is by learning from the mistakes of others. We 
can learn lessons from the examples of failures given in Scripture – of 
Adam and Eve, Cain, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, David, 
etc. We can also learn from the failures of churches and preachers that 
we have seen around us. Then we won’t have to repeat those mistakes 
ourselves. 
Elisha Takes Over from Elijah
Chapter 1: Ahaziah was the new king of Israel and he was very angry with 
Elijah for rebuking him for his idolatry. So he sent fifty soldiers to capture 
him. Elijah told the captain of the army, “If I am a man of God, let fire 
come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty soldiers” (1:12). 
Fire  came  down  immediately  from  heaven  and  killed  all  of  them.  This  
happened a second time with another group of fifty. The third captain 

214 Through the Bible: Corruption in Israel and Judah
2 Kings
begged Elijah to be merciful to him and then Elijah went with him to the 
king and told the king that he would die for his idolatry.
It was these incidents that James and John referred to, when Jesus 
came to this same place – Samaria – and the Samaritans did not receive 
him. They wanted to call down fire from heaven like Elijah did. But Jesus 
rebuked them saying, “You don’t realise what spirit you have. I have come 
to save men’s lives, not to destroy them.” (Luke 9:55, 56). There we see the 
difference between the new covenant spirit of Christ and the spirit of the 
old covenant prophets.
Chapter  2:  Here  we  see  the  persistence  of  Elisha,  when  Elijah  tested  
him. When Elijah was about to be taken up to heaven, Elisha went along 
with him to Gilgal. Elijah told Elisha to stay in Gilgal, as he was going to 
Bethel. Elisha said, “No. I am coming with you.” At Bethel, Elijah again told 
Elisha to stay there, since he was going to Jericho. Elisha again replied, 
“No. I am going with you.” At Jericho, the same scene was repeated. Elijah 
then went to Jordan. When they came to the river Jordan, Elijah struck 
the water, opened up the river and both of them walked across. Then Elijah 
asked Elisha “Why have you been following me? What do you want?”
What  about  you?  What  do  you  want?  Are  you  looking  for  a  better  
income, or for a car or a new house? 
Elisha however said, “I want a double portion of your spirit” (2:9). He did 
not want anything else in the world. He wanted the anointing of the Spirit 
that rested on Elijah. That’s why he had followed after Elijah.
God will test us too, before He commits a ministry to us. He will give 
us a certain experience – bring us to Gilgal – and see if we are content 
with that. Some Christians are content, but others will say, “No, Lord. 
I am not satisfied.” God will lead these people further and give them a 
deeper experience – Bethel. He may give you some visions. Some will 
be content with that. Others will say, “No, Lord. I want more of You.” 
Maybe  He  will  do  a  miracle  through  you.  Some  will  now  be  content.  
Others will say, “Lord, I want the Spirit that rested on You to rest on 
me too to transform me into Your likeness. I won’t be satisfied with 
anything less than that.” Do you have such a longing? If so, then let 
me assure you that God will not disappoint you.
I  have  seen  many  Christians  who  have  settled  for  something  much  
less than God’s best – 25%, 50% or 75%. Be like Elisha who pressed on 
to  God’s  best  in  his  generation.  He  got  a  double  portion  of  the  anoint-
ing, because he persisted. And he did twice the number of miracles that 
Elijah had done. 
If you go to many preachers today and say, “I want the baptism in the 
Holy  Spirit”,  they  will  say,  “O,  that’s  easy.  Just  let  me  lay  hands  on  
your head.” He will pray for you and ask you to mumble something and 
will then tell you, “You got it.” But what did Elijah say? He told Elisha, 

Elisha’s Miracles                                                                                                                                        215
2 Kings
“Do you want a double portion of the Holy Spirit? That’s not an easy 
thing at all. You have asked for a very hard thing. But if God allows you 
to see me going up to heaven, then you will get it” (2:10). Elijah left the 
matter in God’s hands. Elijah is a type of Christ here. And this is what 
the Lord says to us, “If you can see Me in heaven at the Father’s right 
hand having conquered everything for you, and believe in Me, you can 
have the anointing.” 
The double anointing is a hard thing to receive. But you can have it if 
you will look at the Lord alone and not at men. That’s the word of the 
Lord to you.
Jesus is the Baptiser in the Holy Spirit even today – not any man. Even 
John  the  Baptist  said,  “I  can  only  baptise  you  in  water.  But  He  will  
baptise you in the Holy Spirit and fire.” No man can baptise you in the 
Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ alone is the Baptiser. So go directly to Him.
While Elijah and Elisha were talking, a chariot of fire came and Elijah 
was taken up. Elisha saw it, took the mantle that had fallen and received 
the double portion of the anointing. There was an immediate proof of it 
too. When he came to the river Jordan, he struck the water and walked 
right across. The anointing will become manifest in our lives. We don’t 
have to shout or scream or even tell anyone of our experience. Our life and 
our ministry will speak for themselves – even to people who criticise us.
Elisha’s Miracles
We read further of the many different type of miracles that Elisha did. In 
one city, the water was very bad. Elisha asked them to bring him a new 
vessel full of salt. He poured it on the waters and the waters were healed 
(2:20). 
In Chapter 3:11, we see a beautiful title given to the prophet Elisha by 
others in Israel: “He who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.” Each 
time, after Elijah had finished eating, Elisha would bring some water and 
pour it for Elijah to wash his hands. He did that job so regularly and faith-
fully that others observed it and gave him that title! That is how Elisha 
started out on his ministry. God will test our faithfulness in little things 
before He commits a ministry to us. Joshua had served Moses faithfully 
for many years before he became the next leader. Timothy served Paul 
faithfully and became an apostle.
Elisha  was  not known  as  a  great  preacher or  a  great  prophet when 
he  started  out.  He  was  known  only  as  a  servant.  Many  young  people  
miss God’s best because they look for fame in the ministry and not for 
opportunities to serve others. Jesus taught us by His example that we 
should wash people’s feet till the end of our lives. It’s not that we begin by 
washing people’s feet for a few years, and then move up to more senior 

216 Through the Bible: Corruption in Israel and Judah
2 Kings
ministries! No. We are called to wash people’s feet until the end of our 
lives. We must always be ready to do the lowly tasks.
Jesus said that He had come to serve others, and not to be served by 
others (Matthew 20:28). Be a servant always – till the end of your earthly 
days. If  you  want  to  be  a  servant  of  the  Lord  forever,  be  a  servant  of  
people forever. Always consider yourself a servant of others and nothing 
else. When you serve the Lord, others will be kind to you and serve you. 
But don’t ever take any delight in that. Don’t ever look at them as your 
servants. They are your brothers. Be willing to serve them and to wash 
their feet. Most preachers today have become “lords”, and that’s why the 
anointing has gone from their ministry.
I  want  to  show  you  something  else  here  about  prophetic  ministry.  
When Elisha wanted to seek the mind of God so that he could prophesy, 
he  asked  for  someone  to  play  a  harp  (3:15).  As  the  musician  began  to  
play, the hand of the Lord came upon Elisha and he prophesied power-
fully.  There  we  see  the  value  of  godly  music.  I  can  think  of  numerous  
times in my own life when during a time of worship and praise on Sunday 
mornings, the hand of the Lord has come upon me and given me a word 
that I did not have when I came to the meeting. There was a power in that 
anointed music, that brought the spirit of prophecy upon Elisha. 
Even  a  prophet  needs  help  at  times  from  the  musicians.  That’s  why  
those  who  lead  the  music  must  be  anointed.  They  must  not  be  just  
good musicians. They must be anointed, and have a good conscience. 
David appointed singers and musicians, and they had to be anointed. 
Some of the music-leaders like Asaph, wrote twelve wonderful psalms 
(Psalms 50: 73–83). Two of the music-leaders were called seers (proph-
ets) – Heman (1 Chronicles 25:5) and Jeduthun (2 Chronicles 35:15).
So God needs anointed musicians to encourage and support anointed 
prophets. That’s how the church is built. Some of you may not be called 
to be prophets, you may be called to be musicians. Be anointed musi-
cians.  I  don’t  think  Elisha  would  have  been  inspired  that  day,  if  the  
harpist had tried to imitate some worldly style of music. No. There was 
something heavenly about that music. There is music that is worldly and 
music that is heavenly. You can sense when music is heavenly, because 
it will lift your spirit to praise God. Some music only makes you admire 
the musicians! You are an anointed musician if you can lead people to 
praise God and can bring the spirit of prophecy into a meeting.
The Jar of Oil
Chapter 4: Here in verses 1 to 7, we read of a preacher’s widow who was 
in debt. It’s a sad thing when husbands die and leave their wives with a 
debt. That’s something all of us should avoid at any cost. And preachers 

The Jar of Oil                                                                                                                                              217
2 Kings
especially should avoid getting into debt, because that is a bad testimony. 
Now  the  creditor  had  come  to  take  away  her  two  children  as  slaves  to  
repay the debt. Elisha asked her what she had in her home. She replied, 
“Nothing, except a jar of oil.” She called the jar of oil “nothing” and yet the 
solution to all her problems lay right there. The Lord asked Moses some-
thing similar in the desert, “What do you have in your hand.” He only had 
a shepherd’s staff. That was enough. With that staff, he split the Red Sea, 
brought water out of the rock and led Israel right up to the borders of the 
promised land. The widow in Zarephath (whom Elijah visited) had only a 
small bowl of flour and a little jar of oil. But those contained the solution 
to all her family’s problems and saved her and her son from death. We too 
may have some ability that we don’t value and say, “I can’t do anything 
with that.” But that may be the very thing the Lord wants to use. 
This jar of oil here is a picture of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes those who 
serve the Lord say, “I don’t have much money or knowledge. I am not 
gifted  or  clever.  I  don’t  have  any  supporters  to  give  me  money.  The  
needs are so great for the Lord’s work. What shall I do?” So you ask 
them,  “Have  you  received  the  Holy  Spirit?”  “Yes.”  “Then  what  else  do  
you need?”
This woman did not realise that the solution to all her problems lay in 
that jar of oil. Elisha told her, “Go and borrow many large vessels from all 
your neighbours. Then go into your room, shut the door, and keep pouring 
from your jar into these vessels. They will all get filled up. Don’t let other 
people see this miracle. Do it in secret.” (verse 3). This was similar to what 
Jesus  taught,  “Go  shut  the  door  and  pray  and  fast  and  give  your  gifts.  
Don’t let anybody see you do these things.” (Matthew 6:1–18).
A man of God must have a secret walk with God where he has dealings 
with God, before he can stand up in public. Shut the door and you can 
experience the Holy Spirit ministering to all your needs. Then open the 
door and share that with others. Thus you can clear your debt. 
We have a debt to the whole world – to give them the gospel. Paul said, 
“I am a debtor to Jews and non-Jews, to the cultured and to the barbari-
ans – to everybody – to give them the gospel of God.” (Romans 1:14).
We also have a debt to the whole church – to every believer – to show 
them love. The Bible says “Owe nothing to anyone except to love one 
another.” (Romans 13:8).
How are we to clear this two-fold debt – to share the gospel with the 
world  and  to  love  every  child  of  God?  Is  it  money  we  need  or  human  
abilities primarily? No. We need the power of the Holy Spirit. That was 
what Jesus told His disciples to wait for (Acts 1:8). That is what Paul told 
Timothy to kindle afresh within him (2 Timothy 1:6).

218 Through the Bible: Corruption in Israel and Judah
2 Kings
Shut  the  door  and  seek  God  in  secret.  Pursue  after  love  and  seek  
earnestly for the supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit, and especially 
for the gift of prophecy (1 Corinthians 14:1). You can then go forth and 
clear your debt. That is the message of this passage of Scripture.
That widow filled every vessel she could find. She not only cleared her 
debt with that oil, but blessed and enriched her neighbours too – for she 
must have sent those vessels back to them full of oil. That is our calling 
too – to bless our neighbours and everyone we meet. This is why we need 
to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
A Child Raised from the Dead
We read in Chapter 4:8–37 of another woman – a prominent, rich, wealthy 
and influential woman – who was also blessed by Elisha’s ministry. God 
does not choose only the poor and the illiterate and the uneducated to 
bless. He has no partiality. He chose an illiterate Peter, but He also chose 
a highly educated Paul. Peter did not know much of the Scriptures, but 
Paul was a scholar in the Scriptures. There were some rich women who 
supported Jesus and His disciples financially, and Jesus accepted their 
large gifts, because they were godly women (Luke 8:3). 
Here  was  a  wealthy  woman  who  decided  to  support  Elisha.  She  was  
a godly woman too, because when she saw this man visiting them occa-
sionally, she said to her husband, “I perceive this is a holy man of God.” 
How did she recognise Elisha as a holy man of God without even listen-
ing to a single sermon of his? She just observed the way he conducted 
himself at the dining table. What an example for us! It is the little things 
that identify a godly man – the way he sits and talks to people, the way 
he eats his food and the way he conducts himself in ordinary matters. We 
don’t have to listen to his sermons. 
So this woman decided to make a little guest-room in their house for 
Elisha  to  stay  in  –  with  a  bed,  a  table,  a  chair  and  a  light.  Elisha  had  
never even suggested that he needed any of these things. But she was 
a  thoughtful,  considerate  woman  –  as  all  godly  women  are.  God  takes  
care of his servants by providing such places of rest for them, without 
their even expecting it. But a true man of God will never remain in debt 
to such people. So Elisha asked his servant Gehazi what he could do for 
her in return. Gehazi said that she had no children. So Elisha prayed for 
her and told her that she would have a child within a year. And she did. 
That child grew up, and one day became sick and died (4:20). Think 
of the faith of this mother that she did not bury the child immediately, 
but  said,  “Let me first contact the man of God”  (4:25).  So  she  went  to  
meet Elisha. When Elisha saw her from a distance, he told Gehazi to ask 
her, “Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with your 
child?” (verse 26). Listen to the answer of faith that she gave concerning 
her dead child: “It is well.” What faith that was! Elisha went and prayed 

Naaman and Gehazi                                                                                                                                 219
2 Kings
for that child and raised him from the dead. It’s amazing to see what that 
mother’s faith did for that child. According to her faith she received. That 
is why she finds mention in the gallery of the heroes of faith: “Women 
received back their dead by resurrection and gained the approval of God 
by their faith” (Hebrews 11:35, 39). If that mother did not have faith, she 
would have buried her child. What miracles the Lord does wherever He 
finds someone with faith!
 Chapter 4:38–44: Here we read of a time when a poisonous vine was 
accidentally sliced up and put into the food that was being cooked. They 
told Elisha about it. He threw some meal into it and the food was made 
healthy.  This  was  followed  by  another  miracle  –  the  first  instance  of 
multiplying of food in the Bible. The loaves of bread were insufficient for 
the hundred people. But Elisha multiplied the food and there was some 
left over as well, after everyone had eaten to the full!
Naaman and Gehazi
Chapter 5: Here we come to the story of Naaman. God used a little Israelite 
slave-girl to lead Naaman to faith in the true God and to be healed of his 
leprosy. She witnessed to Naaman’s wife about Elisha’s miracle-working 
power. That was the first step that led to Naaman trusting in the God of 
Israel. God could use even a little servant-girl to bless her master with 
a few words. In Chapter 4, we saw the faith of a rich, influential woman. 
Here we see the faith of a poor, little slave girl. God used both of them. 
It doesn’t matter who you are. Even if you are a slave-girl, God can use 
you to lead other people to Him. Maybe you don’t have the ability to give 
someone the gospel. But, like the slave-girl, God can use you to lead a 
person to someone else who can give them the gospel. You can direct that 
person to a prophet, and then you will have your reward as well. 
Naaman first of all went to the king, and the king didn’t know what to 
do. He sent him to Elisha. See how Elisha treated this mighty general. 
This passage shows us what a true man of God is really like. A true man 
of God doesn’t care whether a man is a great man or a small man. Elisha 
showed  more  honour  to  that  poor  widow  when  she  came  to  him  with  
her financial need. But when the great Syrian general (who was used to 
people  bowing  down  before  him)  came,  Elisha  did  not  even  go  to  meet  
him.  Naaman,  the  general  of  the  world’s  most  powerful  army,  had  to  
stand outside the prophet’s hut. Elisha couldn’t care less who Naaman 
was.  How  I  wish  India  had  prophets  like  that.  What  a  different  brand  
of Christianity we would have had in our land, if we had prophets, who 
don’t care for the face of man, but who live before God’s face alone. Elisha 
wanted to help Naaman. But he had to humble Naaman’s pride first. 
He sent his servant Gehazi to go and tell Naaman, “Go and wash seven 
times in the River Jordan” (verse 10). The River Jordan was a dirty, muddy 
river. Naaman was furious and said, “I thought he would surely come out to 

220 Through the Bible: Corruption in Israel and Judah
2 Kings
me and call on the name of the Lord his God, wave his hand over the place 
and cure the leprosy. Why should I go to this filthy river of Jordan? Are not 
Abanah  and  Pharpar,  the  rivers  of  Damascus,  better  than  this?”  (verses 
11, 12). He was so angry that he said, “Let’s pack up and go home.”
A prophet has to irritate people at times in order to deflate their pride. 
God gives some prophets this ministry, because that’s the only way He 
can  reveal  a  man’s  conceitedness  and  pride  to  him.  Jesus  often  irri-
tated proud people, to humble them and to show them that they were 
nothing in God’s eyes. God doesn’t care for a man’s position or honour.
Naaman was irritated with Elisha. But one of his servants had some 
sense  and  said,  “Master,  he  has  asked  you  to  do  such  a  simple  thing.  
Why  don’t  you  try  it?”  So  Naaman  agreed  to  dip  himself  in  the  river  
Jordan.  Imagine  the  great  general  taking  off  his  clothes  and  everyone  
seeing his leprosy. He had to humble himself and obey. When was he to 
stop? Only when his flesh had become clean and clear like a little child’s. 
When you are humbled by some circumstance or person, the word of the 
Lord to you is: “Go down and humble yourself, until you become like a 
little child.” We must not stop until we become like little children, because 
the kingdom of heaven belongs to such. Naaman’s flesh became like that 
of a little child and he was clean. When your flesh becomes like that of a 
little child, you too will be clean. But not until then.
All of us are too big in our own eyes. We are not like little children. Look 
into the eyes of a little baby. It has no feeling of self-importance. That’s 
the place God wants to bring us also to – the place of nothingness. When 
you come to the place where you realise that you are nothing, then you 
too will be clean. Until then, whether it be seven times or seventy times 
seven, you must keep going down.
Naaman  then  came  back  to  Elisha,  amazed  at,  and  grateful  for  the  
miracle-working power of Israel’s God. He brought a lot of money and 
clothes to give to Elisha. But Elisha said, “As the Lord lives I will take 
nothing”  (verse  16).  The  Bible  says  that  we  must  receive  no  money  
from  unbelievers  (3  John  7).  No  unbeliever  has  the  right  to  support  
a  servant  of  God.  Only  God’s  people  have  the  right  and  privilege  to  
support God’s servants. Elisha did receive gifts from godly people. We 
just saw that a rich woman provided a room for him to stay in. But he 
would receive nothing from Naaman. This is where many servants of 
God have missed out on God’s will for their lives. 
But  whereas  Elisha  said,  “No”  to  Naaman,  Elisha’s  servant  Gehazi,  
said,  “What  a  fool  my  master  is!  He  didn’t  ask  for  the  money  (or  send  
out any prayer letters!). The money was offered freely and he still says, 
‘No.’  Well,  if  my  master  doesn’t  take  it,  I  will.”  Greedy  Gehazi  was  not  

Other Miracles by Elisha                                                                                                                          221
2 Kings
concerned about the fact that it was an idol-worshipper who was offering 
money to God’s servant. He ran after Naaman for the money (verse 21) 
–  just  like  a  lot  of  preachers  today  run  after  rich  people.  Then  Gehazi  
cooked up a lie and told Naaman, “Two students have just come from the 
Bible  School  (“sons  of  the  prophets”).  Can  you  please  give  them  a  talent  
of silver and two changes of clothes?” (verse 22). Naaman believed the lie 
and gave him more than he asked for. It is easy to justify false reports 
about God’s work, when covetousness rules your heart. 
We see the same type of lying in reports today such as. “50,000 people 
came for the meeting today. 15,000 people raised their hands to receive 
Christ.  A  great  revival  has  started  here”,  etc.  If  you  could  read  all  the  
reports  sent  from  India  to  America,  you  would  think  India  is  blanketed  
with Christian revivals everywhere! We who live here in India know that 
nothing  of  the  sort  is  happening.  But  many  good-hearted  believers  in  
America believe these tales and send money sacrificially to these crooks in 
India who write such reports! There are a lot of Gehazis in our land today.
Gehazi collected the money, hid it in his house and came and stood 
before Elisha, with an innocent face. But Elisha was a man of God and 
could  not  be  fooled.  Elisha  asked  Gehazi  where  he  had  gone.  He  gave  
Gehazi  the  opportunity  to  confess  his  sin.  But  Gehazi  was  dishonest  
and lied. Elisha replied, “I know everything, Gehazi. God showed me in a 
vision everything you did. I saw Naaman turning around and I saw you 
collecting the things from him. Is this the time to receive money from these 
heathen  people,  to  receive  clothes,  olive  groves,  vineyards,  sheep  and  
oxen in the name of the Lord?” What a word that is for today’s preachers! 
Gehazi was Elisha’s servant just like Elisha had been Elijah’s. Elisha 
had obtained a double portion of Elijah’s anointing, and Gehazi could 
have got a double portion of Elisha’s. That would have been four times 
the  anointing  that  Elijah  had!  But  whereas  Elisha  had  pursued  after  
Elijah  persistently  for  the  anointing,  Gehazi  pursued  after  Naaman  
for his money. Elisha got the anointing Elijah had. And Gehazi got the 
leprosy that Naaman had!! Not only Gehazi, but his children got leprosy 
as well. Spiritual leprosy has befallen many preachers today as well, 
as they have pursued after rich people and Western Christian organi-
zations, telling lies and giving false reports, in order to get money. The 
children  of  these  preachers  have  suffered  too.  He  who  has  an  ear  to  
hear, let him hear.
Other Miracles by Elisha
We see another miracle that Elisha did in Chapter 6. When certain Bible-
School  students  were  doing  some  construction  work,  an  axe  that  they  
had borrowed fell into the river. They came and told Elisha about it. He 
promptly threw a stick into the river and the iron-axe floated up to the 

222 Through the Bible: Corruption in Israel and Judah
2 Kings
surface! Here again we see the principle of resurrection (life out of death) 
being manifested – as in the other miracles that Elisha did, such as the 
raising of the dead Shunammite boy, the healing of the poisonous stew, 
and the curing of Naaman’s leprosy.
Let us look at another incident now that shows us what true prophecy 
is. The king of Aram was fighting against Israel and he told his servants 
that he would be setting up his army camp in a certain place (6:8). But 
God  showed  the  king’s  plan  to  Elisha  –  and  Elisha  warned  the  king  of  
Israel about it. Thus the king of Israel protected his army from Aram more 
than  once.  The  king  of  Aram  wondered  how  this  was  happening,  and  
suspected that someone in his camp was spying for Israel. But someone 
who knew the truth told the king that there was a prophet in Israel who 
was warning Israel’s king about the movements of the Aramean army.
This  is  the  purpose  of  true  prophecy  today  in  the  church  too.  What  
did  Elisha  do?  He  warned  Israel  that  the  enemy  would  be  coming  to  a  
certain place next week and to prepare for that. This is what prophecy in 
the church should do too. Week after week, the spirit of prophecy in the 
meetings of the church should warn God’s people where the enemy will 
come.  A  church  that  has  such  a  prophetic  ministry  is  blessed  indeed.  
Wasn’t it a blessing to have a prophet like Elisha in Israel? It is equally 
wonderful to have a prophet in a church who can warn people through 
the Word what they need to be prepared to face. That is why the Bible 
says, “Earnestly desire to prophesy” (1 Corinthians 14:1).
In 6:24–29 we read of a great shortage of food in Samaria, because the 
Aramean army was surrounding the city. Things were so bad that women 
were eating their own children. But outside the city there were four lepers 
(who, being lepers, were not allowed inside the city) (7:3). They decided to 
go to the Aramean camp and ask for food. They said, “The worst they can 
do to us is kill us. But we are dying of hunger here in any case. So let’s 
go to them.” When they reached the enemy camp, they discovered that 
the soldiers there had all fled, because the Lord had made them hear the 
sound of galloping horses! So these lepers found plenty of food there. But 
then they said, “We must tell others about this. We must not keep this 
good news to ourselves.” So they went and told the good news to the city 
of Samaria and thus the city was saved from death. This is why we must 
preach  the  gospel  to  others  too.  We  were  lepers,  spiritually  speaking,  
but God blessed us and gave us food that saved our lives. But there are 
millions of people in the world who are still dying, because they do not 
know this good news (“gospel”). We must go and tell them.
In Chapter 9, we read of the death of Jezebel, the wife of Ahab. She was 
someone  who  had  opposed  the  true  prophets  of  God  consistently,  and  
her name has now become a symbol of those who oppose God’s servants. 
In Revelation  2:20,  the  Lord  told  the  elder  of  the  church  in  Thyatira,  
“You are permitting your wife Jezebel to lead my servants astray” (Literal 
translation).  That  elder’s  strong  wife  was  controlling  the  church  –  and  

Assyria Attacks Israel and Judah                                                                                                             223
2 Kings
she is called a ‘Jezebel’. There are unfortunately many weak elders today 
like that who allow their wives to be Jezebels who control their church – 
just like the original Jezebel controlled Ahab. If you are a prophet of God 
like Elijah, you will have to confront these Jezebels and put them in their 
proper place. Otherwise your church will be destroyed by such Jezebels. 
We  read  here  that  Queen  Jezebel  was  thrown  down  from  the  top  of  a  
building and her body was smashed to bits. No woman must be allowed 
to have power in a church.
In Chapter 13:14, we read that Elisha was sick and died of that sick-
ness. Why didn’t Elisha claim Exodus 15:26 (“I the Lord am your Healer”), 
as many preachers today would have asked him to do. A man like Elisha 
had enough faith to raise the dead. So if he was not healed, it was certainly 
not due to lack of faith! Why God permits sickness in the bodies of His 
servants  is  one  of  the  mysteries  that  we  may  never  be  able  to  explain  
fully. But we can believe that it always fulfils a purpose that will glorify 
God.  God  had  some  purpose  in  allowing  Elisha  to  die  of  his  sickness,  
even as when He gave Paul a thorn in his flesh. God could have taken 
Elisha to heaven in a chariot of fire as with Elijah. But He took Elisha 
to heaven in a more humiliating way. We must submit to God’s dealings 
with us and never compare our lot with that of others. But the amazing 
sequel to this story is that when the Moabites were later burying a man 
in that very same grave, as soon as the dead man came in contact with 
Elisha’s bones, he arose from the dead (13:20, 21). So Elisha had more 
anointing in his dead bones than many preachers have today when they 
are alive!! There was certainly no lack of faith in his case.
Assyria Attacks Israel and Judah
In Chapter 17, we read about Israel’s captivity, which took place about 
730 years before Christ. The Assyrians came, captured Israel and took 
them away. It is written about these Assyrians in 17:33 that “they feared 
the Lord and served their own gods.” It is this counterfeit “fear of the 
Lord” that is found in much of Christendom today too. Most Christians 
today have a certain respect for God, but actually serve their own gods of 
money, their job, their own honour, their earthly position, their position 
in the church, etc. 
In Chapter 18 we read about King Hezekiah of Judah. Hezekiah’s father, 
Ahaz,  had  been  a  very  wicked  king,  who  had  thrown  Hezekiah’s  older  
brother into the fire as a sacrifice to heathen idols (2  Kings  16:3).  But  
Hezekiah was different from his father and a good king. Praise the Lord 
for  children  who  are  willing  to  be  different  from  their  fathers  because  
they fear God.
In 18:4, we read that the people of Judah were still worshipping the 
bronze serpent that Moses had made in the wilderness more than 700 
years earlier. Hezekiah was the one who finally broke this superstition 
in Judah and destroyed it. Consider the many godly men who had lived 

224 Through the Bible: Corruption in Israel and Judah
2 Kings
in Israel during those 700 years – Joshua, Samuel, and David (the man 
after God’s own heart). But none of these godly men had understood that 
this  bronze  serpent  should  be  destroyed.  All  of  those  godly  men  must  
have tolerated it saying that it was different from an idol, because God 
Himself had commanded it to be made. But Hezekiah saw clearly that it 
was an idol. Praise God for men like Hezekiah.
Do  you  think  that  there  is  a  difference  between  an  idol  of  Jesus  (or  
of  Mary)  and  the  idol  of  some  other  religion?  No.  Both  are  idols  that  
God  hates.  Even  a  bronze  serpent  that  had  once  been  made  at  the  
command  of  God,  was  not  acceptable  to  God  as  an  object  of  worship.  
Man is not supposed to worship bronze serpents or any other idol! But 
even  David  did  not  have  light  on  this  elementary  truth.  God  gave  that  
understanding to a lesser king. Sometimes ordinary believers can have 
light on truths in Scripture that more well-known Christians don’t have 
light on. Let us never forget this fact.
In Chapter  19,  we  read  that  after  the  king  of  Assyria  had  captured  
Israel, he came against the southern kingdom of Judah as well. Hezekiah 
then cried out to the Lord for help (19:15). That night a single angel came 
and destroyed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers (verse 35). Jesus told Peter in 
Gethsemane that He could call 72,000 angels to help Him, if He wanted. 
72,000 angels could have destroyed 13 billion people (72,000 x 185,000) 
– more than twice the world’s population today!! Such is God’s ability to 
defend His people against the might of the world. This is why Jesus never 
had any fear. We need never live in any fear either.
After that, Hezekiah faced another problem. He was mortally ill, and 
the Lord told him, “Set your house in order. You are going to die, and 
not live” (20:1). When God tells us that it’s time for us to die, we must 
be willing to leave the earth immediately. For God alone knows what 
is best for us. So, when God tells us that it’s time to go, we should not 
want  to  stay  on  in  this  rotten  world  any  longer.  To  depart  and  to  be  
with Christ is far better. But Hezekiah was unwilling to go and pleaded 
for a lengthening of his life. The Lord granted his request and added 
another 15 years to his life. But what happened during those 15 years? 
He produced a son, Manasseh. Manasseh was 12 years old when he 
became king (21:1). He was obviously born during those extra 15 years 
that Hezekiah had been granted. He reigned for 55 years and was the 
worst king that Judah ever had (2 Chronicles 33:9). And he was born, 
because  Hezekiah  was  unwilling  to  die,  when  God  told  him  that  his  
time on earth was up. 
In Chapter  24,  we  read  that  Assyria  was  defeated  by  Babylon  which  
became  the  new  world  superpower.  Babylon  now  came  against  Judah  
and  destroyed  Jerusalem.  Tradition  tells  us  that  Isaiah  prophesied  
during the early days of Manasseh’s reign, that he was persecuted for his 
strong condemnation of Judah, and that he went and hid himself inside 

Assyria Attacks Israel and Judah                                                                                                             225
2 Kings
a hollow log. He was found, and Manasseh sawed the log into two thus 
sawing through Isaiah’s body too. We read about people who were “sawn 
in two” in Hebrews 11:37.
The Second Book of Kings begins with Elijah being taken up to heaven 
and  ends  with  the  people  of  Judah  being  taken  to  Babylon.  What  a  
contrast! We too can choose to go, either to heaven, or to Babylon. It all 
depends  on  whom  we  choose  to  please.  Those  are  some  of  the  lessons  
that we can learn from II Kings.



1 CHRONICLES
The Preparation for the Temple
F
irst and Second  Chronicles  were  written,  as  far  as  we  know,  after  
the children of Israel came back from their captivity in Babylon for 
70  years.  Perhaps  it  was  Ezra  who  wrote  it.  These  two  books  are  
different from the two books of Kings, in that they deal with the history 
of Judah alone. 
Israel split into two kingdoms after Solomon’s death. Rehoboam headed 
one and Jeroboam headed the other. The northern kingdom called Israel 
had ten tribes and the southern kingdom called Judah had two tribes – 
Benjamin and Judah. The kings of Israel were generally all wicked. But 
in Judah, some of the kings were good and some were bad. The books of 
Kings deal with both the nations. The books of Chronicles however deal 
with the kings of Judah alone – starting with Saul and David. There is 
quite  a  bit  of  repetition  here  of  what  is  found  in  Kings  –  but  that  is  to  
emphasise certain lessons – as in the case of the four gospels. Most of 
what  is  written  in  Chronicles  is  history  and  we  have  already  covered  
them when we studied 1 and 2 Kings.
The first nine chapters of 1 Chronicles give us the family tree of David 
starting from Adam. One reason why God has given us this long gene-
alogy of Reuben and Simeon and the priestly line and the other tribes is 
to show us that God is interested in individuals. He is not interested in 
tribes but in individuals. The entries in God’s book of Life are also indi-
vidual. It doesn’t say there, “So many thousands of people from Kerala 
are  born  again  and  so  many  from  Tamilnadu,”  etc.  No.  Each  person’s  
name  is  written  down  individually  teaching  us  that  God  is  personally  
interested in each one of us. He knows all about your family tree too – all 
the way back to Adam. He knows your entire life-history, and He has a 
plan for your life. That should encourage all of us – to know that we are 
not lost in the billions on the face of the earth, but individuals whom God 
knows  by  name!  He  knows  all  about  us  and  our  ancestors.  He  knows  

228 Through the Bible: The Preparation for the Temple
1 Chronicles
every little detail about our lives. He even knows the number of hairs on 
our head!!
I want to point out a couple of verses in Chapter 4. We read there of 
a  man  named  Jabez  (4:9).  “Jabez  was  more  honourable  than  his  broth-
ers.” Notice that when God writes down the history of different men, He 
emphasises the fact that some were more honourable than others! When 
the apostle Paul wrote a list of his co-workers (Roman 16), he also stated 
that some were more wholehearted than others. Even though we may all 
be His children, yet He makes a note of those who are “more honourable” 
than others.
He was named Jabez because his mother bore him with much pain. 
It   says there that he called on the God of Israel (4:10). He prayed saying, 
“Lord,  bless  me,  enlarge  my  border,  so  that  Your  hand  will  be  with  me.  
And keep me from harm, that it may not pain me.” And God granted Jabez 
what he requested.
We can apply that prayer to ourselves spiritually. First of all: Becoming 
more honourable than others has a close link with the amount of pain 
and suffering we are willing to go through. One who has gone through 
pain  and  suffering  and  come  through  them  triumphantly  is  more  
honourable in God’s sight than others. So we should not despise pain. 
We should long for the blessing of God on our lives and constantly ask 
Him to enlarge our spiritual borders. We must never be satisfied with 
what we have attained at any time. We should ask God to let His hand 
– His power – be with us always. We must ask Him to protect us from 
evil and from evil men, so that we don’t get hurt – either spiritually or 
physically. God granted Jabez what he asked for, and He will grant us 
our petitions too.
David’s Mighty Men
In Chapter  12,  we  read  of  those  who  stood  by  David  when  Saul  was  
persecuting  him.  It  was  easy  to  join  David  after he  had  become  king.  
But  here  we  read  of  people  who  joined  him  at  a  time  when  he  was  
rejected  and  being  hunted  for  his  life.  It’s  easy  to  live  totally  for  the  
Lord in heaven, but it is quite another matter to follow Him totally here 
on earth where He is rejected and despised. In the same way, it is easy 
to  join  a  church  after  it  has  become  famous  and  popular,  but  quite  
another thing to join it when it is despised, because you see that the 
anointing is there. 
The  men  who  became  David’s  army  generals  later  were  those  who  
followed him at a time when he was being persecuted by Saul and rejected 
by Israel. In our day also we see something similar. God raises up a man 
to do a work for Him in a particular place, but only a few have eyes to 
recognise God’s anointing on him and on his ministry. These few join him 

David’s Mighty Men                                                                                                                                 229
1 Chronicles
and  don’t  care  what  ‘Saul’  or  anybody  else  says  about  him.  Thus  they  
accomplish an eternal work for the Lord in their generation. We need to 
train our senses to recognise where the anointing of God is today.
A  true  servant  of  God  will  never  be  popular,  even  as  his  Master  was  
unpopular.  Jesus  said,  “Woe  unto  you  when  everyone  speaks  well  of  
you, because they spoke thus about the false prophets. But blessed are 
you when all men speak evil of you, because that’s how they treated all 
the  true  prophets.”  (Luke  6:22,  26). Very  few  people  have  understood  
this fact. A true prophet is almost never fully recognised or valued in 
his lifetime.
The  history  of  the  church  shows  that  even  the  true  apostles  were  
rejected and despised by others in their lifetime. Paul was rejected by the 
believers in Corinth. He said in 2 Timothy 1:15, “All those in Asia have 
forsaken me.” Paul was true to God until the end of his life, but most of 
his fellow-believers forsook him. Jesus was true to His father and most 
people left Him too.
Some of the sons of Benjamin came to David when he was in a cave 
(12:16). David met them and told them “If you have come peacefully, my 
heart will be with you. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies 
– my conscience is clear – may God punish you.” We have to be careful, 
because even today there are people who can come to us, pretending to 
be our friends. But if our conscience is clear, God will deal with them.
But  look  at  the  wonderful  example  of  Amasai  (12:18):  “The  Spirit  of  
God came upon Amasai, who was the chief of the thirty valiant men, and 
he said, ‘We are yours, O David. We are with you, son of Jesse. Peace to 
you  and  peace  to  him  who  helps  you.  Your  God  helps  you.’  Then  David  
received them and made them captains of his band.” People like Amasai 
recognised God’s anointing upon David, despite David’s outward circum-
stances, because the Holy Spirit was upon them.
If you read the history of the church you will find that the truly godly 
men who stood against the established religious system in Christendom 
were  always  persecuted.  You  have  heard  of  how  Martin  Luther  was  
persecuted  by  the  Roman  Catholic  system.  Perhaps  you  have  heard  of  
John  Calvin  too.  But  there  was  another  group  of  wholehearted  believ-
ers  at  that  time  called  the  Anabaptists,  who  were  persecuted  not  only  
by the Roman Catholics, but also by the followers of Martin Luther and 
John  Calvin!!  These  Anabaptists  were  godly  people  who  sought  to  live  
godly lives, totally separated from the spirit of this world – and they were 
persecuted  severely  for  their  stand.  They  met  in  the  forests  and  many  
of their leaders were killed. Church history may not have written much 
about them. But one day when Jesus returns, we will discover that these 
people were the men who stood wholeheartedly for God in their day. And 
this is true in our day too. 

230 Through the Bible: The Preparation for the Temple
1 Chronicles
Look for the anointing of God upon a man – not for supernatural gifts 
(even  Satan  has  supernatural  gifts),  but  for  the  anointing  and  the  
grace of God – those are the proof that God is with a man. And if God 
approves  of  a  man,  we  better  approve  of  him  too!  Amasai  had  that  
much sense!
Notice another characteristic of David (in 13:1): “David consulted with 
the captains of the thousands and the hundreds, even with every leader.” 
A  true  man  of  God  works  in  fellowship  with  others.  One  reason  why  
David  got  such  tremendous  support  from  the  people  was  because  he  
discussed things with them. His attitude was, “I am a weak brother and 
I need your opinion. What do you think about this?” He sat down and 
discussed things with people who were junior to him and together came 
to  a  decision  along  with  the  other  men.  And  then  we  read  in  verse  4, 
“All the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the 
eyes of all the people.”
David’s Preparations for the Temple
In Chapter 22, we read of David preparing material for the building of the 
temple. God had told David that he would not build the temple, but that 
his son Solomon would build it. But see what David did in preparation for 
it. He set stonecutters to hew out the stones for it and made all the neces-
sary preparations for it, so that things would be easy for Solomon later 
on. He also gave a lot of gold, silver and bronze and arranged for timber 
and large quantities of iron to make nails for the temple. Even though he 
knew that he would not have the privilege of building the temple, which 
was originally his own vision, he still did everything possible to help build 
it. If God does not give you a ministry, do everything possible to support 
others to whom God has given such a ministry. That is what we can learn 
from David’s example.
David was very thoughtful and said, “My son Solomon is young, inex-
perienced, and the house has to be a magnificent house. So I will make 
preparations  for  it.”  (22:5).  It’s  a  wonderful  heritage  that  we  give  our  
children  when  we  make  preparations  for  them  to  follow  the  Lord  in  
their generation. David told Solomon “With great pains I have prepared 
for the house of the Lord 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of 
silver,  bronze  and  iron  beyond  weight,  and  a  great  quantity  of  timber  
and  stone,  and  prepared  workmen  and  masons.  Arise  and  work,  and  
may the Lord be with you.” (22:14–16). How easy it became for Solomon 
when his father had done so much of the work for him. Godly men are 
like that towards their children.

David’s Preparations for the Temple                                                                                                     231
1 Chronicles
David then told everyone, “Set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord 
your  God.  Arise  and  build  the  sanctuary  of  the  Lord  so  that  you  may  
bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God into 
the house that is to be built for the name of the Lord.” (22:19).
In Chapters 23 to 27, we have a list of names of the various Levites, the 
divisions of musicians, the gate keepers, the commanders of the army, 
etc. David was interested in each one of them, and their names are all 
listed. Then  David  told  Solomon,  “Be  strong  and  courageous.  Don’t  be  
dismayed for the Lord God is with you.” (28:20). If Solomon had endured 
until the end in the strength of that exhortation from David, his life would 
have been very different.
In Chapter 29:3–5, David lists some of the gold and silver that he gave 
over and above what he had given earlier, because of his “delight in the 
house of my God.” He had already given so much for the work of the Lord. 
But after a while he felt he had not given enough and gave some more. 
God loves a cheerful giver and David was a man after His own heart. How 
is it with us? Are we cold and calculating in our giving? Do we wonder at 
times, if we have given too much!! 
Then  David  prayed  a  prayer  of  praise  to  the  Lord  (29:10–19).  All  the  
assembly  blessed  the  Lord  God  and  worshipped  Him  (verse  20).  Then  
Solomon was made king and David died.
One  last  point:  Chapter  29:29  refers  to  Samuel  and  Gad  as  “seers”. 
Why  were  these  prophets  called  seers?  Because  they  could  look  ahead  
and see what other people could not see in the future.
The great need in the church today is for seers – men and women who 
have spiritual vision and who can see into the future, who can under-
stand what will happen in a few years’ time, if some particular practice 
(that  looks  innocent  right  now)  is  permitted  in  the  church.  A  seer  is  
one who can see when a church is in danger of going dangerously off 
track. Today the deviation from the straight line of truth may be very 
small – perhaps just one degree – and the distance from the truth may 
be very small – perhaps only a few centimetres. But in a few years, the 
distance could become many kilometres! A seer sees the dangers that 
lie ahead and refuses to permit the slightest compromise.



2 CHRONICLES
The Temple Built and Destroyed
T
he first nine chapters of 2 Chronicles deal with the rule of Solomon, 
much of which we have already seen when studying 1 Kings.
In Chapters  10–36,  we  read  of  the  reigns  of  20  kings  of  Judah:  
Rehoboam,   Abijah,   Asa,   Jehoshaphat,   Jehoram,   Ahaziah,   Athaliah   
(queen),  Joash,  Amaziah,  Uzziah,  Jotham,  Ahaz,  Hezekiah,  Manasseh,  
Amon,  Josiah,  Jehoahaz,  Jehoiakim,  Jehoiachin  and  Zedekiah.  These  
chapters describe five periods of backsliding in Judah and four times of 
returning to God. Finally it ended in Judah being taken captive to Babylon.
King Asa’s Good Beginning and Later Failure
In Chapters 14 to 16 we read of King Asa who started out as an excel-
lent king (14:2–6). When he was attacked by a million-man Ethiopian 
army,  he  called  on  the  Lord  with  one  of  the  most  wonderful  prayers  
for help found anywhere in the Old Testament: “Lord, there is no one 
besides Thee to help in the battle between the powerful and those who 
have no strength; so help us, O Lord our God, for we trust in Thee and 
in Thy Name have come against this multitude. O Lord Thou art our 
God; let not man prevail against Thee” (14:11). That expression of 
faith was enough for the Lord to rout the enemy. That prayer of help-
less  dependence  on  the  Lord  is  a  good  prayer  to  pray  when  we  face  
some trial too. 
But after the victory, a prophet came and warned Asa saying, “If you 
continue to seek the Lord, He will allow you to find Him; but if you forsake 
Him,  He  will  forsake  you”  (15:2). God  knew  the  danger  of  Asa  becom-
ing more self-confident after his victory and of ceasing to be constantly 
dependent on the Lord for help. This is the danger that we all face. 

234 Through the Bible: The Temple Built and Destroyed
2 Chronicles
Sure enough this was exactly what happened. For the next twenty years 
things went well with Asa. But then he faced another enemy – Israel – that 
had a much weaker army than the Ethiopians. But this time, instead of 
seeking the Lord, he decided to seek for help from a heathen king (16:1–6).  
His immediate problem was solved thereby, but Asa lost out spiritually as 
a result. God sent the prophet Hanani to point this out to Asa.
In Hanani’s words to Asa, we have one of the most wonderful promises 
in the Old Testament: “The eyes of the Lord move to and fro throughout 
the earth that He may strongly support those whose hearts are completely 
His.” (2 Chronicles 16:9). Notice here that the Lord’s eyes are not search-
ing for the wholehearted – for He already knows who they are. It says here 
that His eyes are moving around looking for ways in which He can support 
these  wholehearted  ones.  This  is  a  wonderful  promise  that  assures  us  
that if we are wholehearted disciples of Jesus, the Lord will move on our 
behalf to support us all over the earth.
One  of  the  prayers  that  I  have  prayed  for  many  years  now  is,  “Lord,  
lead me to people who are seeking for a godly life in my city, so that 
we can bless one another. Then lead me to such people in my country, 
and all over the world as well.” If your heart is completely the Lord’s, 
and if your only ambition is to glorify God and do His will on earth as 
it is done in heaven, then the Lord will lead you to other people of like 
mind, from all parts of the world. He will bless you through them and 
bless them through you. That has been my experience through many, 
many years now.
Many Christians are correct in the doctrines, but their hearts are not 
completely  the  Lord’s.  They  have  other  ambitions.  Even  many  full-time  
Christian workers have private ambitions. They seek for honour, money 
and comfort. Therefore they never experience the fulfilment of this promise.
Give up every carnal ambition then and give your whole heart to the 
Lord to fulfil His purpose alone, and He will work on your behalf mirac-
ulously. If you are waiting on the Lord to find a marriage-partner, He 
will bring someone for you, from the other end of the world if necessary, 
because  His  eyes  are  moving  across  the  earth  on  your  behalf.  He  will  
open doors for you across the earth to serve Him, without your having 
to lift a finger yourself. He will meet every need of yours, even before you 
ask Him. There are amazing blessings in store for those whose hearts are 
completely His!
But  King  Asa  did  not  respond  in  repentance  to  Hanani’s  message.  
Instead, he was so angry that he imprisoned the prophet. Things went 
from bad to worse. Asa then began to oppress the poor Israelites (16:10). 
Three years later Asa faced another crisis – this time in his own body. He 
had a sickness that affected his feet severely – perhaps diabetic gangrene. 
Being the king he had enough money to call for the best doctors in the

land to attend on him. But he never did what he should have done first, 
before  calling  the  doctors  in:  Judge  himself  and  seek  the  Lord.  And  so  
despite the best medical attention, he died (16:12, 13).
Other Kings of Judah
Chapter 18: Here we read of Jehoshaphat joining with Ahab to fight in 
battle. They wanted a word from the Lord first and so they got the prophet 
Micaiah to come and prophesy for them. Micaiah was a true prophet of 
God. But someone told Micaiah, “Please let your message be just like the 
message of all the other prophets who have already prophesied victory for 
Ahab.” But the other “prophets” were all false prophets. I have had invi-
tations to meetings where I too have been told what to speak and what 
not to speak. But Micaiah said, “What the Lord tells me to speak, I will 
speak.” We must not be influenced in our preaching by what others tell us 
to say. If you listen to God, He will tell you what to speak. Many preachers 
today read books that come from American preachers and repeat what 
they read there. But does God speak only to people in America? Doesn’t 
He speak to people in India too? Be a man of God and be one who listens 
to God. Because Micaiah spoke only what God told him to speak, they 
persecuted him. They slapped him and locked him up in prison (18:23). 
True prophets have always been persecuted, throughout history.
In Chapter  20,  we  have  one  of  the  most  amazing  stories  in  the  Old  
Testament  that  illustrates  the  power  of  praising  God.  There  are  many  
lessons that we can learn here. A great multitude of enemies had gath-
ered  together  to  make  war  against  King  Jehoshaphat.  Jehoshaphat,  
having  learnt  a  lesson  from  his  previous  compromise  with  Ahab,  now  
decided to seek the Lord. He prays one of the finest prayers of trust in 
the Lord – in the same class as the prayer prayed by his father Asa (in 
14:11). Notice seven things that Jehoshaphat reminded God and himself 
and acknowledged in his prayer:
1. The absolute sovereignty of God (verse 6).
2. What God had done for Israel in the past (verse 7).
3. The promises of God (verse 8, 9).
4. That Israel was God’s inheritance (verse 11).
5. Their utter weakness (verse 12).
6. Their utter lack of wisdom (verse 12).
7. Their utter dependence on God (verse 12).
God  responded  to  that  prayer  immediately  by  sending  a  message  
through a prophet saying, “Don’t be afraid. The battle is not yours but 
God’s. Go and face your enemies. The Lord is with you” (verses 15–17).
So  Jehoshaphat  sent  the  singers  into  battle  in  front  of  the  soldiers!  
And  as  these  singers  began  praising  the  Lord,  the  Lord  defeated  all  of  

236 Through the Bible: The Temple Built and Destroyed
2 Chronicles
Judah’s enemies. Judah also became wealthy through all the wealth they 
got from their enemies. 
This  story  illustrates  the  way  of  victory:  Through  confessing  the  
sovereignty and the promises of God in faith and praising the Lord in 
advance, even when the enemies (problems) are still there. Our faith is 
expressed in praise. “They believed His words – they sang His praise” 
(Psalms  106:12).  The  reverse  is  also  true:  When  we  don’t  sing  God’s  
praise, it proves that we don’t believe His words!
In Chapter 26 we read of King Uzziah. Isaiah the prophet got a vision of 
the Lord in the year that this king died (Isaiah 6:1). King Uzziah started 
out  well  and  “as  long  as  he  sought  the  Lord,  he  prospered”  (26:5).  But  
“when he became strong, his heart became proud and he acted corruptly” 
(26:16). The same story has been repeated in Christendom often in the 
last 2000 years. God blesses a man and he gets puffed up. It’s very diffi-
cult to remain humble when God has blessed you and used you mightily. 
Uzziah became proud because of his successes and decided to minister 
as a priest too. He had not learnt the folly of doing this from King Saul’s 
experience 300 years earlier. Azariah, a fearless priest, along with eighty 
other priests, opposed Uzziah (26:17, 18) and said, “It is not right for you, 
Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord, but for the priests.” Thank God for 
such men who are not afraid even to rebuke kings. We need a few men 
like  that  in  Christendom  today.  Uzziah  became  angry  with  the  priests.  
But  even  while  he  was  angry,  the  judgement  of  God  fell  on  him  and  
leprosy broke out on his forehead. He ran out of the temple (26:20), was 
cut off from the people, he could never enter the house of the Lord again 
and died as a leper (26:21). It’s a very dangerous thing when you try to 
move into a ministry which God has not given you. 
In Chapter  32,  we  read  of  a  miraculous  healing  that Hezekiah  expe-
rienced  from  the  Lord.  The  Lord  gave  him  a  sign  too  (32:24)  –  the  sun  
went backwards in the sky (2 Kings 20:1–11). In other words, the earth 
rotated ten degrees in the opposite direction! In Joshua’s time the sun 
had  only  stood  still.  But  in  Hezekiah’s  time  it  went  backwards  (Isaiah 
38:8).  People  in  Babylon  saw  this  happen  and  heard  that  it  had  some  
connection with Hezekiah. So some of them went to Israel to meet him 
(verse  31).  Hezekiah  felt  very  proud  of  himself,  and  showed  off  all  his  
wealth  to  the  Babylonians.  Very  soon,  the  prophet  Isaiah  came  to  him  
and  told  him  that  everything  he  had  shown  the  Babylonians  would  be  
taken  away  by  them  one  day  (2  Kings  20:13–17).  But  see  what  it  says  
in Chapter  32:31. When  these  rulers  came  to  ask  Hezekiah  about  this  
wonder, “God left Hezekiah alone to test him”, to see whether he would 
be humble and give God all the glory, or whether he would be proud and 
take the glory to himself. He failed the test.

2 Chronicles
Many times after God has done something for us, He will test us, to see 
whether we take the glory to ourselves or whether we will be humble 
and give the glory to God. Perhaps God has blessed your ministry in 
some unique way. And you testify about it or write about it in such a 
way that the credit comes to you. This is what Hezekiah did. He was 
such a good king. But how sad that he had to end his life in this way!
In Chapter 33:12, 13, we read something about Manasseh that is not 
written in 2 Kings. Towards the end of his life he repented after he had 
been taken captive. When he was in distress, he pleaded with the Lord. 
Manasseh had done such terrible evil in Jerusalem for 50 years. He had 
led the people astray, worshipped idols and even offered his own children 
as sacrifices in the fire. But then he repented and prayed – and amaz-
ingly God listened to him! God was moved by his prayer and brought him 
back to Jerusalem. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord was God (33:13). 
He destroyed the idols, set up the altar of the Lord, sacrificed peace offer-
ings and ordered Judah to serve the Lord.
If Solomon had repented like that, it would certainly have been recorded 
in Scripture. No such record however is found in Solomon’s case. That’s 
why we know that Solomon went to hell. But Manasseh repented. It is 
how a man ends his life that matters more than how he begins it.
In Chapter  36:21,  we  are  given  the  reason  why  the  Israelites  were  
sent to Babylon as captives for 70 years? The law had commanded that 
they were to give a Sabbath-rest to the land every seventh year and sow 
nothing  that  year  (Exodus  23:10,  11).  But  they  disobeyed  God  in  their  
covetousness  and  were  punished,  as  God  had  warned  them  (Leviticus 
26:34,  43).  For  490  years  they  had  disobeyed  God,  not  giving  the  land  
its Sabbath-rest. And so God sent them into captivity for 70 years. God’s 
judgements are exact and catch up with us sooner or later.



EZRA
The Remnant that Returned
E
zra  lived  at  the  time  when  the  Israelites  came  back  from  their  
seventy years of captivity. 
Two  journeys  of  Israel  are  recorded  in  the  Old  Testament.  The  
first journey was from  Egypt  to  Canaan,  and  this  symbolises  salvation  
for the individual Christian – redeemed by the blood of Christ (Passover 
lamb),  baptised  in  water  (in  and  out  of  the  Red  Sea),  baptised  in  the  
Holy Spirit (cloud coming from heaven) and conquering the lusts of the 
flesh (the giants in Canaan). The second journey was their move from 
Babylon to Jerusalem after the captivity. That speaks about building the 
church. The first symbolises our personal walk with God. The second 
symbolises  our  coming  out  of  dead  religious  systems  (Babylon),  and  
building the Body of Christ (Jerusalem). Many prophets spoke about this 
movement  of  God’s  people  from  Babylon  to  Jerusalem.  Babylon  has  a  
spiritual meaning in the New Testament and refers to a corrupt, harlot 
Christendom  that  professes  to  follow  the  Lord,  but  does  not  actually  
follow Him (Revelation 17). Jerusalem (Revelation 21) refers to the true 
church, the Bride of Christ.
The Return Under Zerubbabel
Ezra was one of the men whom God used in the second movement in the 
Old  Testament.  His  book  deals  with  the  return  of  the  Israelites  under  
their leader, Zerubbabel (Chapters 1, 2), the construction of the temple 
(Chapters  3–6),  and  the  reformation  under  his  own  (Ezra’s)  leadership  
(Chapters 7–10).
We read first of all, that God moved King Cyrus to order the building of 
the temple. Cyrus said, “The Lord God has given me all the kingdoms of 
the earth and has appointed me to build the house for Him in Jerusalem” 
(Ezra 1:2). See the sovereignty of God that moved a heathen king to order 
the building of God’s temple in Jerusalem! 

240 Through the Bible: The Remnant that Returned
Ezra
Cyrus went on to say, “Whoever is among you let him go up to Jerusalem 
and rebuild the house of God.” (Ezra 1:3). He did not compel any Israelite 
to  go.  They  were  free  to  choose.  Even  so  today  –  we  are  free  to  stay  in  
dead religious systems or to move away from them to Jerusalem.
And then Cyrus said, “Let the men support him with a freewill offering 
for the house of God” (1:4).
To build Jerusalem, the Body of Christ, the first thing we need to recog-
nise is that God is sovereign over all people. He could move ungodly 
rulers in that day and He can move anyone even today, to fulfil His 
purposes. If we do not believe that, we cannot build Jerusalem. 
The second thing  we  need  to  recognise  is  that  God  never  compels  
anyone to leave Babylon. All are invited to leave. But no-one is forced 
to  do  so.  We  must  give  people  freedom  to  choose,  for  God  loves  only  
cheerful givers.
The third thing we see is that those who don’t go personally can still 
support  God’s  work  with  “a  freewill  offering”  (1:4).  If  we  can’t  build  
Jerusalem  personally,  we  can  still  support  its  building  with  freewill  
offerings.
Why did that Persian king Cyrus support God’s people so much?
The answer perhaps lies here: Nearly 200 years before Cyrus was born, 
the  prophet  Isaiah  prophesied  about  him  by  name:  “Thus  says  the  
Lord, ‘When I say of Cyrus, “He is my shepherd,” he will certainly do 
as I say. He will command that Jerusalem be rebuilt and that the 
Temple be restored. This is what the Lord says to Cyrus, his anointed 
one, whose right hand he will empower. Before him, mighty kings will 
be paralyzed with fear. The Lord says: ‘I will go before you, Cyrus, I will 
smash down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron. I will do this 
so you may know that I am the Lord God of Israel. And why have I called 
you for this work? It is for the sake of Israel my chosen one. I called you 
by name when you did not know me. I have prepared you so all the world 
from east to west will know there is no other God’ ” (Isaiah 44:28–45:6).
Daniel, who was still alive at that time, must have shown this Scripture 
to Cyrus – and Cyrus must have been overwhelmed to know that Almighty 
God had prophesied about him by name, two centuries earlier. This would 
have humbled him; and he did what Isaiah prophesied that he would do 
– command the Jewish people to go back to Jerusalem and rebuild the 
temple!! God’s ways are truly amazing.
In Chapter 2, we read a list of the people who left Babylon. God makes 
a note even today of each person who leaves Babylon. Their leader was 
Zerubbabel. God always needs a man to lead His people out of Babylon. 

The Construction of the Temple                                                                                                             241
Ezra
God  makes  a  note  of  the  name  of  every  person  who  has  left  corrupt  
Christendom and come into the true church of the Living God.
Babylon is of course a more comfortable place to live in than Jerusalem. 
It was so then and it is so even today. It was difficult, dangerous and 
expensive to go to Jerusalem those days. Many Israelites would have 
said to themselves, “Why should we move? We are quite comfortable 
here  in  Babylon.”  Many  believers  who  are  in  ungodly  systems  today  
say the same thing. They can get “married” and “buried” with greater 
honour  in  Babylon.  But  the  wholehearted  want  to  be  where  God  is  
moving in their day and want to be where the anointing of God is. They 
do  not  seek  their  own  comfort  or  honour.  Thus  a  sifting  takes  place  
among God’s people even today.
In Chapter 2:40, we read that only 74 Levites left for Jerusalem. Why 
was the number so small? The Levites had been commanded by God not 
to  own  any  property.  They  were  to  be  supported  by  the  tithes  of  God’s  
people. They saw here that the people going back to Jerusalem were very 
poor and felt that those poor people would be unable to pay any tithes at 
all, and even if they did, it wouldn’t amount to much! Therefore most of 
the Levites decided to stay back in Babylon. It was more secure for them 
there. Only 74 could trust God to take care of them in Jerusalem! It is 
the same story today. Preachers still go where there are rich people who 
can give them handsome gifts!
In Chapter  2:59–63,  we  read  of  certain  people  who  could  not  give  
evidence concerning their father’s household to prove that they were true 
Israelites.  These  are  a  picture  of  those  today  who  are  not  sure  about  
their salvation. Some who claimed to be from the priestly tribe could not 
locate their names in the ancestry records. So they were excluded from 
all  priestly  functions  until  a  priest  could  come  who  could  reveal  God’s  
opinion (with the Urim and Thummim) whether they were priests indeed. 
We see there that the leaders were very strict about the ancestry of those 
who  wanted  to  build  Jerusalem.  We  too  must  be  especially  careful  to  
demand  high  standards  of  purity  from  those  who  are  to  be  leaders  in  
the church. We must be certain of the salvation experience of those who 
want  to  be  a  part  of  our  church.  We  live  in  a  day  when  standards  are  
being lowered for people to be baptised and to join the church. This is 
because  of  the  craze  for  impressive  statistics  and  numbers  today.  We  
must ensure that people are really converted before they are allowed to 
join the church. John the Baptist did not baptise the Pharisees because 
they were unrepentant. That is a good example to follow.
The Construction of the Temple
There are a number of interesting parallels in what we read in Chapters 3 
to 6 with what happened in the early days of the church in Acts.

242 Through the Bible: The Remnant that Returned
Ezra
We  read  about  the  beginning  of  the  construction  of  the  temple  in  
Chapter 3. There was a great spirit of unity among the people. “The sons 
of  Israel  were  in  the  cities.  The  people  gathered  together  as  one  man  in  
Jerusalem”  (3:1).  That  was  like  the  120  who  waited  as  one  man  in  the  
upper room for the Holy Spirit. 
“Jeshua and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel and his brothers 
arose and built” (3:2). It was a body-ministry and not a one man show.
They first built the altar and offered burnt offerings (3:2). This speaks 
of the pre-eminent place being given to the message of the cross, to build 
the Body of Christ. And then they celebrated the ‘Feast of Booths’ accord-
ing to the ordinance. They honoured God’s Word. Then there was a time 
of praise (3:10) when the builders laid the foundation of the temple. The 
priests stood and with trumpets and cymbals began to praise the Lord. 
That’s another thing that must be found in Jerusalem (the true church) 
– a spirit of praise and worship.
This  was  followed  by  a  time  of  “weeping  with  a  loud  voice”  (3:12). 
Mourning for our sins is also a necessary part of building the church.
Chapter 4:1: The next thing that happened was opposition. No genuine 
work  of  God  will  be  without  enemies.  These  enemies  pretended  that  
they too wanted to help in building the temple. But Zerubbabel said, 
“You have nothing in common with us in building a house to our God” 
(4:3).  We  do  not  cooperate  with  unbelievers  even  if  they  are  nominal  
Christians.  They  may  say,  “We  also  serve  your  God.  We  are  also  
Christians.” But we say “No”. Thank God for men like Zerubbabel and 
Jeshua who put their foot down and said, “Nothing doing.” Thank God 
for people like John the Baptist who refused to baptise the Pharisees, 
saying, “You must repent first.” We need more people like John the 
Baptist, Zerubbabel and Jeshua in the church.
Then these people got up, joined up with the people of the land, and 
(4:4)  tried  to  frighten  them.  There  was  religious  opposition,  fear  and  
harassment.  They  hired  counsellors  (4:5)  to  frustrate  their  counsel  –  
all  this  opposition  to  these  simple  people  who  just  wanted  to  build  the  
temple! When you try to build the house of God as the Body of Christ you 
will  face  a  lot  of  opposition.  If  you  are  interested  only  in  coming  out  of  
Egypt and living an individual Christian life, there may not be much of a 
problem. But if you go further to this second movement from Babylon to 
Jerusalem, you will face many attacks from Satan. But your life will be 
exciting, because God is sovereign. God permits this opposition, and He 
overcomes both kings and their decrees. The enemies sent a request to 
the king, and a decree came from the king (4:17–22). They went with the 
king’s order to Jerusalem and stopped the work. The king was influenced

by the false reports. You can be sure that there will be a lot of false reports 
when you try to serve the Lord. Religious people, secular authorities, the 
police and many other people will turn against us. Thus the work stopped.
So what did God do? He killed that king and raised up another – Darius 
(4:24)!
In 4:24,  we  see  that  even  16  years  after  returning  to  Jerusalem,  the  
Jews  hadn’t  got  past  laying  the  foundation  of  the  temple.  This  was  
because the Jews had a casual attitude towards building the temple and 
were all busy building their own homes (See Haggai 1:1–4). The prophets 
Haggai and Zechariah then challenged the people to put God first and to 
build His temple (5:1, 2). 
But  once  again  the  enemies  were  stirred  up  and  said,  “Who  told  you  
to build this temple?” And then we read this wonderful verse, “The eye of 
God was upon them, and they could not stop them” (verse 5). The enemies 
sent a report to King Darius, and Darius issued another decree, because 
he found the decree that Cyrus had made. Notice the sovereignty of God 
in  operation  here.  Darius  wrote,  “Leave  this  work  on  the  house  of  God  
alone. I issue a decree that you must do whatever you can to help build this 
house. The full cost is to be paid out of the royal treasury. Whatever 
is needed – bulls or rams or wheat or salt – they must be given” (6:7, 8).
Who was Darius’ advisor? Daniel. God has His people everywhere to 
help His servants. So we see that the opposition only worked for good 
here,  because  ultimately  God’s  people  got  more  than  what  they  had  
earlier: The government paid the entire cost of the construction! 
The temple was finally completed through a body-ministry – with all 
working together. It had started in a very small way, as with all of God’s 
works. But finally they completed a building that God was happy with. 
This is how it is in the building of the church too. Then they celebrated 
the Passover and rejoiced – “because the Lord had caused them to rejoice, 
and had turned the heart of the king to encourage them in the work of the 
house of God” (Ezra 6:22).
After  this,  we  have  a  60-year  gap  before  Chapter  7.  It  is  during  this  
period that we have the story of Esther.
The Return and Reformation Under Ezra
From Chapter  7  onwards, we  read  of  the  return  of  the  exiles  and  the  
reformation under Ezra. The first group of exiles had Haggai, Zechariah, 
Zerubbabel and Jeshua as their leaders. Ezra came with the second group. 
When one servant of God passes on, God raises up another. Praise God that 
generation after generation, He raises up men to lead His people forward. 
Ezra was a teacher – a scribe who was skilled in the law of Moses, a man 
who had studied the word of God in depth – 7:6). We read that he had set 

244 Through the Bible: The Remnant that Returned
Ezra
his heart to study God’s Word, to practice it and then to teach it (7:10). 
What an example for us to follow. God needs men today who will study, 
practise and teach His Word – in that order! Remember that if you want 
God to use you. 
If  Ezra  had  stayed  in  Babylon,  we  would  never  have  heard  of  him.  
Heaven  recognises  those  who  leave  Babylon  and  move  to  Jerusalem.  
Six  times  in  this  book,  we  read  that  Ezra  “went  UP”  from  Babylon  to  
Jerusalem. Moving from Babylon to Jerusalem is always a step UP and 
is the result of “the good hand of God being upon a man” (7:9). Those who 
left Babylon and went to Jerusalem became the ancestors of the twelve 
apostles of Jesus. Our children and our descendants are all affected by 
the decisions that we take today.
The king of Persia, at that time, was a descendant of Esther. This made 
it easier for the Jews.
In Chapter 7:12, we read an interesting contrast of titles: Artaxerxes 
king of kings, and Ezra scribe of the law of God of heaven!! We all know 
which title is greater.
Chapter 7:18 indicates the tremendous confidence that the king had in 
Ezra as a man of integrity that he could tell him: “Whatever seems good 
to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you 
may do according to the will of your God”. Every servant of God should be 
a man of such financial integrity that even the heathen have confidence 
in him. But alas, how rare it is to find people like that today.
In spite of all that the king did for the Jews, Ezra is careful to give all 
the glory to God and not to the king. It was God Who had put those 
kind thoughts in the king’s mind. He is equally careful to give the glory 
to God for giving him the strength to lead God’s people out of Babylon 
(7:27, 28).
In Chapter  8:1,  we  read  of  another  list  of  people  who  went  out  of  
Babylon. This time we notice that the number of Levites has decreased 
to just 38 (7:18, 19). The number of those who can trust God and live by 
faith in Him keeps decreasing!
In Chapter 8:21, we read that Ezra proclaimed a fast. This was a way 
of  expressing  their  humble  dependence  on  God  for  a  safe  journey  to  
Jerusalem.  Ezra  was  ashamed  to  ask  the  king  for  soldiers  to  protect  
them, after having made such a bold confession before the king of their 
faith in an almighty God: “The hand of our God is favorably disposed to 
all those who seek Him, but His power and His anger are against all those 
who forsake Him” (8:22).
In Chapter 8:24–30, we see the wisdom Ezra exercised in the handling 
of  the  silver  and  gold  that  was  being  transported  to  Jerusalem.  He  
told  the  priests,  “This  is  a  sacred  deposit.  Be  careful  with  it.  When  you  
come to Jerusalem you must deliver all of it exactly, to the leaders there.” 

The Return and Reformation Under Ezra                                                                                             245
Ezra
This  teaches  us  the  importance  of  being  faithful  in  the  use  of  money,  
when building the Body of Christ.
We find the phrase “the  good  hand  of  our  God  upon  us”  appearing  a  
number of times in Ezra, indicating how dependent they were, as weak 
and  helpless  exiles  on  God’s  help  for  everything.  This  is  how  God’s  
work is done today as well. There was no pillar of cloud or fire to lead 
Ezra and his band of exiles back to Jerusalem – only the invisible pres-
ence of God.
In Chapters 9 and 10, we read of Ezra having to deal with the problem 
of mixed marriages in Israel. The first thing Ezra did when he heard 
about  it  was  to  mourn  for  the  failure  of  God’s  people  himself  (9:3).  He  
then  gathered  some  others  like  him  who  trembled  at  God’s  Word  and  
had a prayer-meeting along with them, where they confessed their own 
sins  instead  of  blaming  and  judging  the  others  (9:5–15).  Ezra  prayed,  
confessed his sins, wept, and prostrated himself (10:1). “He did not eat 
bread nor drink water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the 
exiles” (10:6). He was an upright man and a scholar in God’s Word. Yet 
he wept and prayed because his fellow-Jews had sinned. This is the best 
way  to  solve  problems  in  the  church  even  today.  We  must  have  in  the  
church, the sound of praise to the Lord and also the sound of weeping 
for our sins.
Ezra  and  his  fellow-Jews  had  gathered  together  before  God  with  a  
sincere concern for God’s Name. You may wonder then why God did not 
stop the rain for them, for it says that it rained heavily all the time that 
the people were sitting there in the open square before the temple (10:9). 
Perhaps it was so that God could test who were wholehearted and who 
were not!
Ezra taught the people to make restitution, to set things right, and to 
confess their sins (10:11). A few people opposed him, but the majority 
supported him. Once again there is a list of the compromisers (10:18–44).  
God keeps a list of the compromisers even today. 
And that’s how the book of Ezra ends.



NEHEMIAH
Completing the Work in Jerusalem
T
here are two movements of Israel described in great detail in the 
Old Testament.
The  movement  from  Egypt  to  Canaan  symbolises  our  personal  life  –  
coming  out  of  sin,  out  of  Satan’s  grip,  out  of  the  world  and  out  of  
legalism, through the blood of Christ, water-baptism and the baptism 
in  the  Holy  Spirit,  into  a  life  of  victory  over  sin  and  a  personal  walk  
with God. 
The  movement  from  Babylon  to  Jerusalem  symbolises  our  corporate  
life – leaving counterfeit Christendom and coming into fellowship with 
others in a genuine expression of the Body of Christ. 
Many Christians think that Babylon refers to certain denominations in 
Christendom and imagine that once they have left those dead denomina-
tions, they have left Babylon. This is not true. 
Babylon is a commercial system. The principle of all commercial systems 
is profit – gain for oneself. As long as a man is living by the principle of 
“personal gain through Christianity” – What he can gain by doing some-
thing for the Lord, What he can gain by joining a church or organisation, 
etc. – he is motivated by the principle of Babylon. A Christian who lives 
after the flesh and seeks his own, even if he is in the best denomination 
in  the  world,  is  still  a  part  of  Babylon.  The  spirit  of  Babylon  is  found 
primarily within a man, and not primarily in a denomination. 
Jerusalem  however  is  a  city  of  sacrifice.  Its  spirit  is  the  opposite  of  
the business spirit found in Babylon. It is the spirit found in the words 
of  David  when  he  said,  “I  will  not  offer  to  the  Lord  that  which  costs  me  
nothing”  (2  Samuel  24:24).  To  build  the  body  of  Christ  –  “the  heavenly  
Jerusalem” – requires such a selfless spirit that is concerned about the 

248 Through the Bible: Completing the Work in Jerusalem
Nehemiah
glory of God alone, and that does not seek one’s own. And a person with 
such a spirit may be found at times even in a dead denomination. For the 
spirit of Jerusalem too is primarily an inward thing, and not an outward 
matter.
If we seek to build the Body of Christ, it is important that we gather 
together those who have understood this principle of sacrifice. Otherwise 
we shall just build another system like the old one. This is what many 
of the so-called ‘separated churches’ have done, and now they are just 
as dead (or more dead) than the mainline denominations.
Jerusalem’s Broken Wall and Burnt Gates
Nehemiah was one of the men God used in the movement of His people 
from  Babylon  to  Jerusalem.  He  lived  about  70  years  after  Zerubbabel,  
Joshua, Haggai and Zechariah. The temple had been built and Ezra had 
already gone to Jerusalem – about 13 years earlier. 
The burden God had given Haggai, Zechariah and Zerubbabel was to 
build  the  temple.  Ezra’s  burden  was  to  teach  people  the  Word  of  God.  
But  Nehemiah’s  burden  was  to  build  the  walls  of  Jerusalem,  organise  
the  city’s  administration,  and  bring  people  back  to  the  covenant  that  
they had forsaken. He was a reformer. Spiritually, he was a man of vision 
and prayer. Practically, he was an organizer and a motivator. So he had 
all the qualities that were required in a leader of God’s people at such a 
time as this.
Nehemiah  was  living  in  Susa,  the  capital  of  the  world’s  only  super-
power of those days – the Medo-Persian empire – and was on the personal 
staff of its king, Artaxerxes.
Chapter1:1–3:  When  Hanani  and  other  Israelites  came  to  Susa  from  
Judah,  Nehemiah  was  concerned  enough  to  find  out  the  state  of  the 
exiles who had returned and the state of Jerusalem. This is the primary 
characteristic of any man whom God uses – he has a concern for people 
and then God gives him a burden. If you want to serve the Lord, begin 
with a concern for others. God never uses a man who has no concern for 
others. Nehemiah asked Hanani, “How are things going on there?” And 
Hanani told him that the walls were broken down and the gates burned 
with fire.
In Isaiah.60:18, we read that the walls of Jerusalem symbolise salva-
tion and the gates symbolise praise. 
The  walls  speak  of  separation  from  the  world  and  of  security.  God  
wants  the  church  to  be  separate  from  the  world.  The  walls  have  to  be  
high, so that a worldly-minded person cannot join the church. To be a 
part of Jerusalem, one has to be a disciple, one who loves Jesus more 
than anything else on earth. Throughout the last 20 centuries, preach-
ers have lowered the standards that Jesus and the apostles laid down, 

Jerusalem’s Broken Wall and Burnt Gates                                                                                            249
Nehemiah
so that now the walls are so low, that anyone can jump over the wall and 
come in. Jesus once said that one who climbed over the wall and came 
in was a thief (John 10:1). There is a way to come in – through the gate 
– and the gate to Jerusalem is very narrow. But preachers have lowered 
the  standards  so  that  the  wall  of  separation  is  now  very  low.  In  some  
places, the wall is broken down completely, so that there is no difference 
between the church and the world. In fact, many worldly people behave 
much better than many so-called “believers”. That is what a church with 
broken-down walls is like. 
The gates symbolise the spirit of victorious praise that must always be 
found in the church. The gates are also the place where the elders of the 
city sit – the place of authority. The church today has lost the spirit of 
victorious praise and it has very few men with spiritual authority. 
Nehemiah was concerned about the broken walls and the burnt gates. 
When he heard the news, he wept and mourned for many days, and 
he fasted and prayed. That is the type of man whom God is looking for 
today – one who has a concern and a burden when he sees the condi-
tion of God’s church.
When  was  the  last  time  you  mourned,  not  for  sorrows  of  your  own,  
but because the church of Jesus Christ is in such a pathetic condition 
in India today? When was the last time you fasted and prayed because 
you were concerned that the name of Jesus should be glorified in the 
church of Jesus Christ in India today? But if we don’t have a concern in 
our hearts, we will never be the men and women that God wants us to be.
Nehemiah lived under the old covenant. He did not have the Holy Spirit 
dwelling  in  him,  as  we  have.  He  did  not  have  a  full  Bible,  no  church-  
fellowship, books, tapes or conferences such as we have today in such 
abundance. He did not know anything about the cross. Yet he had such a 
tremendous burden. He was not a “full time worker”. He was a man who 
had a secular job. He supported himself and served the Lord. Nehemiah 
is a great example of a man who was absolutely selfless and who was 
concerned for the glory of God’s Name alone. If we can be challenged to 
emulate his example, God may be able to do something with our lives too.
The  movement  of  God’s  people  from  Babylon  to  Jerusalem  began  
with  Daniel.  Daniel  was  a  man  who  fasted  and  prayed  in  Babylon.  
The  movement  continued  through  Joshua,  Zerubbabel,  Haggai  and  
Zechariah.  All  of  them  had  a  burden  for  the  building  of  Jerusalem.  
Fasting and prayer are mentioned frequently in the books connected 
with  this  movement  out  of  Babylon.  Ezra  and  Nehemiah  also  fasted  
and prayed. Some of us may fast and pray when we need an answer to 
prayer desperately – to get healing for some family-member or perhaps, 
to get a job or to find a marriage-partner. That is good. But Ezra and 
Nehemiah  did  not  fast  and  pray  to  get  something  for  themselves. 

250 Through the Bible: Completing the Work in Jerusalem
Nehemiah
They fasted and prayed for God’s name to be honoured in Jerusalem. 
We should be fasting and praying for that too.
One  of  Nehemiah’s  jobs  was  to  taste  the  wine  that  the  king  drank.  
Kings in those days were afraid of their enemies trying to poison them. 
So they had someone to taste their wine first before it was given to them. 
Obviously, such a man would have to be an absolutely loyal and incor-
ruptible man. It is amazing that this heathen king chose for this important 
task, not one of his own men, but a Jew! That gives us a little indication 
of the testimony that Nehemiah had as a man of integrity. The king relied 
100%  on  Nehemiah  –  and  as  a  result,  Nehemiah  became  a  man  with  
great influence in the palace of the world’s greatest monarch of that time. 
The Beginning of Nehemiah’s Ministry
Nehemiah had never been sad in the king’s presence before (2:1). He was 
not a gloomy type of person. The king had always seen him happy. And 
now he was sad. But he was not sad concerning himself or his family. 
He was sad because Jerusalem was in such shambles. O that there were 
more people like that today who are sad because they see the sad state 
of the church of Jesus Christ!
The king said, “Your face looks so sad! This is nothing but sadness of 
the  heart.”  And  Nehemiah  was  afraid  (2:2).  It  was  a  terrible  thing  to  
ruffle the opinions of a king in those days. I love to see Nehemiah’s 
honesty in admitting that he was afraid. Fear is not something that we 
can eliminate completely from our lives. We will feel fear as long as we 
are here on earth, but we must never act on fear. Paul said he had 
fears (2 Corinthians 7:5). But he never acted on those fears. If you are 
living in a dangerous place, or if you are going to serve the Lord in a 
place where your life could be threatened – there are many places like 
that in India today – you will naturally feel fear. You don’t have to be 
ashamed of that. You are human. But you must never act on the basis 
of that fear. We can be careful and act with caution, but not with fear. 
Fear is the opposite of faith, and when we act in fear, we are acting in 
unbelief. We should never forget that God cares for us.
Although Nehemiah was afraid, he still told the king, “My face has to 
be sad because the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies desolate and 
the gates have been burned with fire.” So the king asked, “What do you 
want?” Nehemiah prayed a quick, short prayer (the best thing to do in 
such  situations)  and  replied,  “If  it  pleases  the  king,  please  send  me  to  
Judah to rebuild that city.” The king said, “How long are you going to be 
away?” A time was fixed and he went (2:3–6).
He  went  to  Jerusalem  and  stayed  alone  three  days  without  going  
anywhere  –  probably  fasting  and  praying  (2:11).  Then  he  rose  at  night  

The Beginning of Nehemiah’s Ministry                                                                                                 251
Nehemiah
and took a few men with him. He had not told anyone what God had put 
into his mind, because he knew that there were enemies who would try 
and hinder him (2:10). He knew it was no use gathering people together 
who  had  no  burden  for  God’s  work.  So  he  went  with  just  a  few  and  
inspected the walls and gates.
As soon as this was known, opposition began, just as in Ezra’s time. 
As  soon  as  someone  is  concerned  that  the  name  of  Jesus  should  be  
honoured,  opposition  begins  immediately.  The  devil  is  alert  to  such  
moves among God’s people. That is one reason why many people never 
seek to live wholly for God and serve Him. They are afraid of opposition 
from the devil.
But  actually  one  way  of  knowing  that  you  are  in  the  will  of  God  is  
to find yourself being confronted by the devil frequently. If the devil 
leaves you alone, you can be fairly sure that you are completely outside 
the will of God. As far as I am concerned, one of the indications that 
I  am  on  the  right  path  is  that  the  devil  stirs  up  people  against  me  
and creates all types of situations to hinder me. Throughout church 
history, this has been the experience of all who have sought to serve 
the Lord in sincerity.
Sanballat and Tobiah mocked and despised the Jews and said, “What 
is this you are doing? You are rebelling against the king” (2:19). But 
Nehemiah replied saying, “The God of heaven will give us success. We 
are going to arise and build. But you people have no portion or right or 
memorial in Jerusalem. We do not work together with you” (2:20).
Nehemiah was a great organizer and a man who could motivate people. 
The people worked with him happily, because he worked himself. That 
is  the  type  of  leader  God  needs  in  India  today  –  one  who  will  fast  and  
pray, who has a concern for God’s name, who is good at organising and 
motivating people to work for the Lord, and one who works with his own 
hands as well. 
We see in Chapter 3 that Nehemiah organised the work very quickly. 
That fact is not mentioned here, because Nehemiah was too humble to 
tell anyone about it. But we can see here that everyone was allotted his 
own task. Even such leaders as the high priest were given a task to do 
(3:1).  The  high  priest  was  the  most  respected  man  in  the  city.  But  he  
was not allowed to sit down and supervise the work. No. He also had to 
take the bricks and mortar and work with his own hands to help rebuild 
the city. It is amazing to see how Nehemiah could get such leaders also 
to work with their own hands. There we see something of the greatness 
of  Nehemiah.  He  gave  people  the  feeling  that  no-one  was  too  big  to  do  
manual work. All of them were brothers and sisters. This is the spirit that 
we need in the church too.

252 Through the Bible: Completing the Work in Jerusalem
Nehemiah
Notice  an  expression  that  occurs  often  in  this  chapter:  “next  to  him” 
(3:2, 4, 7, 8). That means that the wall was built without a gap anywhere. 
They were all different types of people, but they all worked together, coop-
erating with one another so that there would not be an inch of a gap in 
the wall. Even the women worked with their hands (3:12). Shallum was 
a  senior  official  in  Jerusalem.  His  daughters  also  dirtied  their  hands 
working with brick and mortar.
Opposition from the Enemy
In Chapter 4, we see Sanballat the enemy becoming furious as he saw 
the  wall  coming  up.  The  wall  didn’t  cause  any  problems  for  Sanballat  
personally. Why then was he bothered? He was instigated by Satan. We 
see the same thing today too. When as Christians, we do a work for the 
Lord in some area, we don’t harm anyone in any way. Yet many of the 
people  there  oppose  us  vigorously!  We  wonder  why!  We  are  doing  good  
to all of them and being a blessing to society. Then why are the people 
angry? The  only  way  we  can  explain  the  opposition  and  anger  of  such  
people is that they are being instigated by Satan. Why are people in India 
angry with Christians who are improving the lot of the poor people? We 
are not harming them in any way. They are angry because Satan hates 
anyone who glorifies the Name of Christ in any way. We find this princi-
ple throughout Scripture. In Nehemiah’s time, the enemies of the Jews 
became furious and tried to bring governmental pressure on the Jews. 
We see the same thing in India today.
Sanballat then tried to influence the rich people to oppose the work of 
the Jews and Tobiah made fun of the work. What did Nehemiah do? 
He did not get into an argument or discussion with them. He prayed 
saying “O God, we are despised. These people are against us. We are 
only building the wall and these people are against us” (verse 4). And 
the wall continued to be built, because “the people had a mind to work” 
(4:6). Sanballat and Tobiah then conspired to fight against Jerusalem 
and  to  cause  a  disturbance  in  it  (verses  7,  8).  Nehemiah,  however,  
continued to pray and set up a guard against their enemies day and 
night (verse 9). In other words, they both watched and prayed. They 
were alert and watched for the enemy, and they also prayed. This is 
how we must work in our day too.
One of the biggest problems we face in Christian work is that in addi-
tion to the enemies who attack us from without, we also face those who 
murmur and discourage us from within. In the Acts of the Apostles, we 
read that when the disciples multiplied, there was a murmuring among 
the Greek widows saying, “We are not getting as much food as the Hebrew 
widows.  There  is  some  partiality  here”  (Acts  6:1).  Murmuring  coming  

Opposition from the Enemy                                                                                                                   253
Nehemiah
from  within  the  camp  was  something  that  Nehemiah  had  to  deal  with  
too. People in Judah began to murmur saying, “There is a lot of rubbish 
here  and  we  can’t  deal  with  all  this”  (verse  10).  And  Nehemiah  had  to  
handle  all  that  murmuring  and  discouragement.  The  Jews  who  lived  
near them were terribly frightened and shared their fear with others ten 
times saying, “They  will  come  against  you  from  every  side,  be  careful” 
(verse 12). In the church too, we will find many who seek to put fear and 
discouragement into our hearts. 
But Nehemiah was not frightened. He told the people, “Don’t be afraid. 
Remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your broth-
ers and your sons and your daughters” (verse 14). “If we fear God, we 
need  fear  nothing  else”  (Isaiah  8:12,  13  -  Living).  If  we  really  believe  
that God Almighty is supporting us in what we do, it is ridiculous and 
foolish to fear anyone.
In Chapter 5:1–13, we see Nehemiah’s great care for the poor and the 
oppressed and those who were in debt, in their midst. He spoke to their 
creditors and got them all released from their debts. In verse 18, we see 
Nehemiah’s wonderful example in not taking any of the money he was 
entitled  to,  as  governor  of  the  province  –  even  though  he  was  working  
so hard and feeding 150 Jews and many from other nations at his table 
daily! He was a hospitable man who served God, like Noah and Paul did, 
at his own expense. He used all the money available just for building the 
wall. Here was a man who lived with great sacrifice and did not use any of 
the money given for God’s work for himself. Wherever God sees a servant 
of His who is faithful with money, there will be no limit to which God uses 
him. God forsakes many of His servants, because He sees them taking 
advantage of their brothers financially.
Chapter 6: Here we read clearly that the wall was completed without 
any gaps whatsoever. Now Sanballat tried another tactic. He said, “Come, 
let us have a discussion together in the plain of Ono” (6:2). But Nehemiah 
was  not  going  to  be  deceived.  He  sensed  in  his  spirit  that  they  were  
going  to  harm  him.  God  takes  care  of  his  servants  and  protects  them.  
Nehemiah gave them a wonderful reply, which we should give as well, in 
similar circumstances: “I am doing a great work, and I cannot leave it and 
come down to you” (6:3). When God has given us a task to do, we must 
stick to that, and never waste our time in useless discussions. With that 
attitude Nehemiah finished the wall in just 52 days (verse  15).  For  90  
years, from the time that the first exiles had come back to Jerusalem, 
this wall had not been built. God had to wait until he found one man. 
When that one man was found, he did the job in less than two months. 
Many things that God wants done today are not being done. Many years 
go by. What is God waiting for? He is waiting for a man who has a burden, 
who will not be discouraged by opposition, and who will do the work at

Nehemiah
his own cost. Nehemiah also faced problems from the nobles in Judah 
who had marriage links with Tobiah, the enemy of the Jews. Nehemiah 
was surrounded by compromising rulers in Judah. But he went forward 
single-handed and fulfilled the task God had given him.
Revival
Chapters  8  and  9  show  us  the  tremendous  revival  that  God  brought  
among the Jews through the influence that two godly men – Ezra and 
Nehemiah – had over an entire nation. 
In Chapter 8, we read what God did through Ezra. He took the Word of 
God and gathered all the men and women and children who were above 
the  age  of  understanding.  He  then  conducted  a  6-hour  Bible  study  for  
them!  And  it  says  there  that  “all  the  people  were  attentive  to  the  book  
of the law” (8:3). They began their meeting with a time of praising God 
(verse 4). And then Ezra took pains to explain to the people the meaning 
of everything that he read from the Word (verse 8). Obviously Ezra had 
spent many months and years studying the Word himself to have been 
able to explain it all so clearly to all of them. God had prepared him in 
secret for this time. Revival broke out and the people began to weep for 
their sins (verse 9). They were then exhorted to share with others the good 
things that God had given them. In doing so, “the joy of the Lord would be 
their strength” (8:10). The people went out and obeyed that exhortation. 
The  next  day  Ezra  had  a  Bible-study  for  the  leaders  (verse  13).  When  
they  saw  that  the  Word  of  God  had  commanded  the  Israelites  to  cele-
brate “the feast of booths” every year in the seventh month, they obeyed 
it immediately. This was the first time this feast was being celebrated in 
about 900 years – for this command had not been obeyed since the days 
of  Joshua  (verses  14–17).  Even  David,  the  man  after  God’s  own  heart,  
had not got the Israelites to obey this command. Ezra continued to have 
Bible-studies for the people for the next seven days (verse 18).
In Chapter 9, we read what God did through Nehemiah. The chapter 
begins  with  the  Israelites  fasting,  confessing  their  sins  and  separating  
themselves from the heathen (verses 1, 2). Then they had a three-hour 
Bible-study  time  and  three  hours  of  praising  the  Lord  and  confessing  
their sins. It was revival all over again (verse 3). Then the Levites stood 
up and cried to the Lord with a loud voice (verse 4). In verses 6 to 31, 
we have the longest recorded prayer in the whole Bible. The Levites then 
rehearsed  the  history  of  Israel  from  Abraham’s  time,  and  their  failure  
during  the  forty  years  of  wandering  in  the  wilderness  and  during  the  
times of the judges and the kings and acknowledging that every judge-
ment that God had sent was just and right. They repented and signed a 
document before God, with Nehemiah signing first of all (10:1).
All of this came about through the influence of these two God-fearing 
men, Ezra and Nehemiah. Their joint ministry was almost exactly like 

Revival                                                                                                                                                         255
Nehemiah
the  functioning  of  a  new-covenant  church  being  led  by  two  elders.  
What an example for us to emulate today.
Chapter 10 lists a number of decisions that they took as a result of this 
repentance. It was still not popular to live in Jerusalem, for life was diffi-
cult there. But some volunteered to come and live there (11:1, 2).
In Chapter  12,  we  read  how  Nehemiah  organised  the  people  to  look  
after the gates and those who were to lead the times of praise. Notice in 
the movement of God’s people from Babylon to Jerusalem, the constant 
emphasis  on  fasting,  prayer,  confession  of  sin,  many  hours  of  Bible-
study, long meetings and much praising of God. 
In Chapter 13, we see Nehemiah’s zeal for purity in God’s house. He 
went into the temple and did something similar to what Jesus did when 
He cleansed the temple in Jerusalem. Nehemiah found that people had 
allowed  their  unconverted  relatives  to  stay  in  the  temple.  Eliashib  the  
priest was related to Tobiah (13:4) and had prepared a large room for him. 
Nehemiah chased them all out. He “threw out all of Tobiah’s household 
goods and cleaned up the house of God” (13:8). He also noticed that many 
people were making money by selling things on the Sabbath (13:15). He 
rebuked them and warned them and even threatened to use force against 
them (13:21). If people don’t fear God then they must fear a man of God. 
He also discovered that some of the Jews had married non-Jewish women. 
Nehemiah “contended with them, cursed them, slapped them, and pulled 
out their hair and their beards, and made them swear never to give their 
children in marriage to non-Jews again.” (13:25). Thus Nehemiah purified 
the  priesthood  without  any  partiality,  appointed  duties  for  the  priests  
and even got down to the nitty-gritty of arranging for the supply of wood 
for the sacrifices (13:30, 31)!
Nehemiah was a fearless man who was not seeking for a reputation as a 
kind, gentle person. Many Christian leaders are not firm and authorita-
tive when it comes to maintaining God’s standards in the church. When 
God cannot find a man who is strong and authoritative, in a spiritual 
Christlike way, God’s work suffers. That is how Babylon is built.
I have observed through many years that if God cannot find a strong 
leader, He cannot build the true church – Jerusalem. I have also discov-
ered that the reason why many leaders are not strong is because they are 
concerned about their own reputation for gentleness. They think, “What 
will people think about me if I act like that? I want to have a reputation as 
a humble, gracious, gentle person.” Let me say this: If you are concerned 
about your reputation, you might as well forget about building the church. 
You will only build Babylon, even if all your doctrines are right.
Nehemiah was not a man like that. He was not concerned about his 
own reputation – and so God could use him.



ESTHER
God in the Background
T
he book of Esther is the only book in the Bible in which the words 
‘God’ and ‘Lord’ never appear. But we see the hand of God every-
where in the book – invisibly at work behind the scenes, supporting 
and helping His people.
The  books  of  Ezra and Nehemiah  dealt  with  those  Jews  who  left  the  
comfort  of  Babylon  and  Medo-Persia  and  went  to  Jerusalem  to  do  the  
difficult task of rebuilding it. They did it because they had a burden to 
establish a testimony for God in Jerusalem. So God openly manifested 
Himself in support of them. 
The  events  mentioned  in  Esther took  place  between  the  6
th
  and  7
th
 
chapters of Ezra – after the first batch of Jews had returned to Jerusalem. 
In Esther, we read of the Jews who did not want to pay the price of going 
back to Jerusalem, but who wanted to live in the comfort of Babylon and 
Medo-Persia. So God did not permit His Name to be associated with them 
openly. This is why God’s Name is not found in this book.
Many  believers  imagine  themselves  to  be  very  dedicated  people  just  
because they feel emotionally moved when they sing songs of devotion 
to  the  Lord  on  Sunday  mornings.  But  the  human  heart  is  deceitful,  
and such believers can go from such meetings to live for themselves, 
and seek their own, without any concern for the Lord’s work or for the 
building  of  His  church  on  earth.  They  do  not  even  get  a  missionary  
magazine to read in their homes. They look forward to going to heaven 
and they seek God for good health and for prosperity. When they face a 
problem, they are quick to run to God for help. But when the problem 
is solved, they are back to their old way of life – living for themselves. 
Such believers drift along in life, useless to God and useless to men. 
If you want God to publicly identify Himself with you, you must be totally 
sold out for Him. You must say, “Lord, I am not going to live for comfort, 

258 Through the Bible: God in the Background
Esther
money, honour or pleasure. I am going to live only for You. I am willing 
to be what You want me to be.” Those are the type of people you read of 
in Ezra and Nehemiah and there is a list of their names there. 
But  when  we  come  to  the  book  of  Esther there  is  no  list  of  names,  
because God did not identify Himself with these people. But He still cared 
for them. God makes the sun to rise upon the good and the evil. He gives 
material blessings and physical health to both believers and unbelievers. 
And so He protected the Jews who stayed in Persia too. 
The Danger the Jews Faced
King Ahasuerus, who was the world ruler of his time, got drunk one day 
and told his queen Vashti to come and appear before all the other men 
(1:10, 11). She was a modest queen and said, “I won’t come.” The king 
was angry with her and rejected her for disobeying him, and then began 
to look for another queen. Esther was a pretty Jewish girl. So her uncle 
Mordecai encouraged her to apply for the job!
Mordecai was a God-fearing man who had many good qualities. But he 
was a compromiser. The walls and gates of Jerusalem were broken down 
at this time. But Mordecai was not concerned about all that. Nehemiah 
who  came  along  35  years  later  and  lived  in  this  very  same  country,  
however was concerned. There we see the qualitative difference between 
Nehemiah  and  Mordecai.  Whereas  Mordecai  was  concerned  about  his  
own safety, Nehemiah was concerned about the purposes of God.
Mordecai and Nehemiah represent two types of believers – those who 
stay in Babylonian systems and those who leave those systems and move 
to  Jerusalem.  God  does  not  forsake  those  in  Babylon.  No.  He  provides  
for them and protects them from harm. But if you want to fulfil God’s 
purposes, you have to move out of Babylon and say, “Lord, show me your 
will for my life.”
Mordecai  knew  that  the  Scriptures  clearly  taught  that  a  Jewish  girl  
was  never  to  marry  a  non-Jewish  man.  This  was  a  very  serious  sin.  
Nehemiah  had  to  deal  with  this  problem  a  few  years  later  (Nehemiah 
13:25). But Mordecai encouraged this marriage, just because the bride-
groom happened to be the king!
Do you think Mordecai felt he was doing something wrong in encourag-
ing Esther to marry a heathen king? No. Why? Because once a person 
starts compromising in one area, he gets so used to it that very soon he 
can compromise in another area, without his conscience troubling him. 
Even though what the king asked Vashti to do was wrong, and what 
Mordecai did was wrong, yet the Lord in His sovereignty overruled their 
mistakes and brought Esther to the throne in order to save the Jewish 
people from being slaughtered.

The Danger the Jews Faced                                                                                                                     259
Esther
One  day  Mordecai  heard  of  a  plot  being  formed  to  assassinate  the  
king. He told Queen Esther and she informed the king. The matter was 
investigated and those who were plotting against the king were caught 
and  hanged  (2:23).  After  these  things  the  king  promoted  a  man  called  
Haman to be the second-ruler (3:1). All the king’s servants bowed down 
to  Haman  (verse  2).  But  Mordecai  was  a  God-fearing  man  and  refused  
to bow to Haman. Haman wondered why Mordecai would not bow down, 
and discovered that it was because he was a Jew. So Haman became very 
angry with the Jewish people. He decided to wipe out the whole Jewish 
race and very cleverly got the king to pass an order that on a certain date 
all  the  Jews  were  to  be  killed.  For  this,  he  promised  to  pay  one  billion  
rupees into the king’s treasury! He was a rich and influential man.
Haman  was  the  Hitler  of  the  5
th
  century  B.C.  But  Haman  did  not  
succeed. Neither did Hitler, 25 centuries later. Nobody can succeed to 
exterminate the Jews, because God promised Abraham 4000 years ago 
that He would bless his descendants. Hamans will come and go and 
Hitlers will come and go, but God’s purposes will be fulfilled.
Haman was an Agagite (3:1) – a descendant of King Agag the Amalekite. 
King Saul had not killed all the Amalekites as God had commanded him to 
(1 Samuel 15). Perhaps a baby boy had survived then and now 600 years 
later his descendant arose to be a troubler of the Jews. Sin that we don’t 
deal with thoroughly in our lives will come back to trouble us years later.
When  Mordecai  heard  about  this  plan,  he  sent  a  message  to  Esther  
and told her, “You have attained royalty for this particular time.” (4:14). 
Mordecai  told  her,  “Don’t  imagine  that  because  you  are  living  in  the  
king’s palace you can escape. If you remain silent at this time, what will 
happen?  Deliverance  will  come  for  the  Jews  from  somewhere  else.”  We  
don’t find the word ‘God’ even here – not even the word ‘prayer’. Even 
Esther told the Jews only to fast for her for three days and night. She did 
not tell them to pray, only to fast (4:16).
The king’s authority was such in those days that even Queen Esther 
could not go before him if she had not been invited by him. The punish-
ment  to  go  into  the  king’s  presence  uninvited  was  death.  But  Esther’s  
attitude was “If I perish, I perish” (4:16). She was willing to lay down her 
life  to  save  God’s  people  and  she  went  before  the  king.  She  obtained  
favour in his sight and she invited him and Haman for a banquet. 
At the banquet, God arranged circumstances so that Esther did not get 
an opportune moment to reveal Haman’s wicked scheme to the king. This 
was so that Haman’s full wickedness would be revealed – for Haman had 
not yet built the gallows that he built later that night. There is a reason 
why God delays judgement. God told Abraham that the Canaanites would 
not be judged in his lifetime, because they were not ripe for judgement at 

260 Through the Bible: God in the Background
Esther
that time. They became ripe for judgement only 400 years later (Genesis 
15:13–16).
Haman  was  very  proud  because  he  had  been  invited  to  Esther’s  
banquet. He went home and boasted about that and about how rich he 
was (5:11). He boasted about his ten sons (9:10) and about how the king 
had promoted him. “But”, said he, “all this does not satisfy me as long as 
I see this man Mordecai not bowing down to me” (5:13). So Zeresh his wife 
and his friends suggested to Haman that he make a huge gallows 75 feet 
high to hang Mordecai. 75 feet high is the height of a 7-storey building. 
You don’t need a 75-foot gallows to hang a man. You need only a 10-foot 
gallows. Why did he make one 75 feet high? So that Mordecai could be 
humiliated and so that the whole city would be able to see him hanging 
there. But  while  Haman  and  his  wife  were  planning  evil  and  building  
the gallows the whole night, Mordecai was sleeping. There was no need 
for him to remain awake when God was awake and working to protect 
him (See Psalms 127:2). God was watching Haman’s actions and He had 
already planned to do something about it.
The Victory of the Jews
One of the wonderful things we see in Esther is the way God worked in 
sovereign power on behalf of His people. 
That  night  the  king  could  not  sleep (6:1).  Why  was  it  that  the  king  
could not sleep? Because God kept him awake. When people are plotting 
against us, God works on our behalf to protect us from them. Mordecai 
was fast asleep and did not know that a 75-foot gallows was being made 
that night to hang him the next morning.
Because  the  king  could  not  get  any  sleep,  he  asked  that  the  history  
books of the empire be read to him. Perhaps he thought he would go to 
sleep as the history books were being read!! So the history books were 
read – and he still could not get any sleep. God made sure of that. They 
went on reading the books to the king right through the night. At about 
6  o’clock  in  the  morning,  they  came  to  the  story  of  how  Mordecai  had  
saved the king’s life. When the king heard that, he said, “What did we do 
for Mordecai for saving my life?” (6:3). They said, “Nothing has been done.” 
So the king planned to honour Mordecai.
At  that  very  moment  –  you  see  the  amazing  timing  of  God  here  –  
Haman  came  to  the  king’s  palace  to  get  permission  from  the  king  to  
hang Mordecai. Before Haman could speak, the king told him, “I want to 
honour  somebody.  How  do  you  think  I  should  do  it?”  Haman,  conceited  
man that he was, immediately thought that the king must be thinking 
of honouring him. So he said, “Let him ride on the king’s horse and let a 
prince lead him down the street and say, ‘This is how the king will honour 
anyone  who  is  faithful.’  ”  The  king  said,  “Go  and  do  that  for  Mordecai  

The Victory of the Jews                                                                                                                            261
Esther
straightaway”  (6:10).  I  would  have  loved  to  have  seen  Haman’s  face  at  
this time!
It is wonderful to see how God turns the tables on Satan. But this was 
only the beginning of Haman’s humiliation. 
When  Haman  went  to  Esther’s  banquet  that  night,  Esther  exposed  
Haman’s  plan  to  the  king.  Haman  fell  down  before  Esther  and  begged  
for mercy. He who had wanted the Jews to kneel before him now kneels 
down before a Jew. The Lord said to one of His faithful churches, “I will 
make them to come and bow down at your feet and to know that I have 
loved you” (Revelation 3:9).
Because Haman had boasted to many about the gallows he had made 
for Mordecai, others knew about it. Therefore they suggested to the king 
that Haman himself be hanged on it. How good it would have been if he 
had kept quiet about it. He who had wanted to humiliate Mordecai before 
the nation is now humiliated himself. 
“He who digs a pit for others will fall into it himself” (Proverbs 26:27).
“The righteous is delivered from trouble and the wicked takes his place” 
(Proverbs 11:8). 
In Chapter 8, we read how Mordecai was promoted and given Haman’s 
job.
In Chapter 9, the Jews destroy their enemies.
Mordecai  became  like  Joseph  and  Daniel,  an  advisor  to  the  greatest  
king on earth of his time.
God was good to these Jews, even though they stayed back in Persia.
All of this is written for our instruction to teach us that nobody can 
harm us in any way, until God’s time comes. Twice it is written about 
Jesus, “They could not arrest Him because His time had not yet come.” 
(John 7:30; 8:20). They could not chop off Paul’s head until God’s time 
for him on earth was over, because God works on behalf of His serv-
ants to protect them.
If God worked on behalf of these people who were compromisers, who 
were seeking their own in Persia, how much more He will do for us today 
who  want  to  live  for  Him  totally.  That  is  the  great  encouragement  that  
comes to us from the book of Esther. When we are asleep, God works on 
our behalf to protect us from evil men who may seek to destroy us.
If  we  have  that  faith,  we  can  go  out  and  serve  God  in  any  situation,  
however difficult. If the devil can put fear into our hearts and make us 
act on that fear, then we will never be able to serve God. Remember 
that when we act in fear, we are glorifying the devil and proclaiming 
that the devil is almighty and that God cannot protect us. There are 

262 Through the Bible: God in the Background
Esther
many believers who live with that type of fear. But one who has faith 
in  God  will  say,  “God  is  almighty.  Everything  in  Scripture  shows  me  
that God works on behalf of His people. He is watching over us all the 
time. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to 
work on our behalf. The Lord who watches over me will never slumber 
or sleep. He is the One who protects me.”
We  need  never  have  any  fear,  even  if  multitudes  of  people  scheme  
against us. When we serve the Lord, Satan will get many people to try 
and harm us. I have had many experiences where evil people schemed 
and planned things to hurt me and trap me. But things didn’t work out 
the way they anticipated, because God in heaven was observing all their 
evil schemes. He frustrated their plans, turned the tables on them and 
made fools of them and of the devil whom they served. What did I have to 
do? Just trust in God – and sleep like Mordecai did!
This is the God we worship and serve.
The Jews were triumphant there in the book of Esther and the enemy 
was defeated. 
It will be like that in our lives too.

JOB
The Problem of Suffering
T
he book of Job is the only one of the 39 books in the Old Testament 
that is written by someone who has no connection with Abraham. 
His  wealth  is  mentioned  in  sheep  and  cattle  just  like  Abraham’s  
was; and he is the priest in his own family, like Abraham was. He lived 
longer  than  Abraham  too.  All  these  facts  indicate  that  Job  must  have  
lived in the period between Noah and Abraham. So Job is one of the earli-
est men of God that we know of, after Enoch and Noah. 
This book must have been written during Job’s lifetime – for the private 
conversations  that  Job  had  with  his  wife  and  his  friends  are  recorded  
in such great detail. That would not have been possible if the book had 
been  written  even  a  few  years  after  the  events  took  place.  The  book  of  
Job, therefore, is the first book of inspired Scripture – written hundreds 
of years before Genesis (which was written by Moses about 1500 years 
before Christ). 
It is interesting to see that when God decided to write Scripture, the 
very first book He wrote was, not about creation, but about a godly man. 
That teaches us what God always looks for. He looked for a godly man 
in  the  time  of  Enoch,  in  the  time  of  Noah  and  in  the  time  of  Job.  God  
planned from the beginning to give us 66 books of Scripture. And in the 
very first of those books, He wrote about what was uppermost in His 
heart – a godly man.
The book of Job gives us an insight into some matters that are not found 
anywhere else in the Bible. We see here what happens in the “heaven-
lies” when one of God’s children is suffering on earth. Job himself did 
not know what was happening there, when he was suffering. If he had 
known it, he would have been greatly comforted and strengthened in 
the midst of his trials. But this has now been revealed to us. So we are 
in a much better position now than Job was. 

264 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
Job must have discovered this fact by Divine revelation, after he had 
come through his sufferings and been blessed by God. So we can under-
stand why Job complained so much. But we cannot find comfort in Job’s 
complaints  and  imagine  that  we  can  do  the  same  thing  –  because  we  
have been given much more revelation than Job had. To whom more is 
given, more is required.
Even though it is true that God works through the church corporately, 
yet He often uses one man to influence many others in the church. The 
apostle Paul is one example. What loss the church would have suffered if 
Paul had not been available to God as totally as he was. Single-handedly, 
Paul kept the wolves from entering the church in Ephesus for three years. 
As soon as he left the scene, the wolves entered in (Acts 20:29, 30). God 
needs godly men (and women) like Job and Paul, even today.
A Godly Man
Notice the first sentence in the first inspired book of Scripture: “There 
was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job, and that man was 
blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil” (Job 
1:1). Can you see the heart of God in the first sentence of Scripture? 
It was about one man – a man identified by his name – Job – and by 
the place he lived in – Uz (so that he is not confused with some other 
Job living somewhere else). And God gives His testimony of that man 
– not about his cleverness, or his wealth, or his reputation with other 
men, but only about his character. There we see what God truly values 
– uprightness, fear of God and turning away from all evil. I hope that 
challenges us.
God is not looking for people with Bible-knowledge primarily. Job did 
not have any Bible knowledge because there was no Bible then. He had 
no-one around him to encourage him to live a godly life either. Even the 
preachers of his day only discouraged him by what they said. But in spite 
of all this, he lived an upright life.
When we read of Job suffering so much – losing all his property and 
his  ten  children  in  a  single  day  –  we  can  wonder  whether  this  story  is  
only a parable. But 1400 years after Job lived, God said in Ezekiel 14:14 
(repeated in verse 20), that Job was one of the three most righteous men 
who  ever  lived,  Noah  and  Daniel  being  the  other  two.  (Amazingly,  God  
included  young  Daniel  also,  who  was  living  at  that  time  in  Babylon!!).  
And the Holy Spirit, through James, writes about the endurance of Job 
(James 5:11). That proves that this is a true story.
In 1:4,  5  we see the concern that Job had for his children. The first 
book of Scripture shows us the importance of having a godly family. 
A godly man brings up his children in godly ways. 

Satan’s Discussion with God                                                                                                                   265
Job
Job had seven sons and three daughters. They had all grown up and 
were living in their own houses. Job was very concerned that none of them 
should fall away from God. His sons used to celebrate their birthdays with 
a few days of feasting in their own houses and would invite their sisters to 
come and eat and drink with them. When these periods of feasting were 
over,  Job  would  send  for  them.  He  rose  up  early  in  the  morning  (Even  
that significant habit of this godly man is mentioned in the first pages 
of inspired Scripture.) Job would then offer separate burnt offerings for 
each of his children and consecrate each of them afresh to the Lord. Job 
did that because he felt that his children may have sinned in their hearts 
during their time of feasting. Notice that he was concerned that they might 
have sinned in their hearts. Job was not thinking merely of external sins 
like worshipping idols or adultery that they may have committed. He was 
concerned about sin in their hearts by which they may have dishonoured 
God. And he prayed that God would forgive his children their sins. A man 
becomes godly by being sensitive to sin in the heart. Such a man shuts 
the door, gets alone with God, judges himself and has dealings with God 
over sin in his heart that other people know nothing about.
There were many good things that Job did, like caring for the poor, the 
blind and the widows (29:12–16). But primarily he brought up his chil-
dren in godly ways. He prayed for his children – and it is written that he 
did so continually. A godly man has habits that he practises constantly. 
He practices his faith continually and not in occasional spurts. Many 
people seek God only when they are in trouble. But Job was not like 
that. He lived close to God even when things were going smoothly.
Satan’s Discussion with God
In Chapter 1:6, we read of the “sons of God”. This refers to the angels. 
This phrase is used to refer to direct creations of God. We were not born 
as  a  direct  creation  of  God  like  Adam  was  created.  Adam  was  called  a  
son of God because God created him directly. We were born through our 
parents. But when we are born again, that is a direct creation of God – 
the new creation – and so we are called “sons of God” too.
Satan also came among these angels. He was also a direct creation of 
God. He could not come into the immediate presence of God in the third 
heaven for he has been cast out from there forever. But he could speak to 
God from the second heaven where he had his headquarters. Satan told 
God that he had been “roaming about on the earth and walking around on 
it” (1:7). Satan is a world-traveller. Don’t imagine that it is a great thing to 
be a world-traveller. If God calls you to do that for His glory, that is fine. 
But remember that in Jesus’ entire earthly life, He travelled only within a 
circle that was less than 100 miles radius from his hometown of Nazareth 
– because that was the will of God for Him. So don’t ever imagine that 
those who travel around the world are the luckiest of all people. 

266 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
There is a difference between the way God works and the way Satan 
works.  Satan  is  always  restless  –  roaming  to  and  fro.  There  is  a  haste  
about all his works. God however works slowly and patiently.
Satan  travels  around  the  world,  watching  believers  especially.  He  
moves  about  like  a  roaring  lion,  seeking  whom  to  devour  (1  Peter  5:8). 
When  God  asked  Satan,  “Have  you  considered  My  servant  Job?”  Satan  
replied, “Yes, I know all about him.” Satan knows the true spiritual state 
of  every  person.  His  demons  also  move  around  everywhere,  examining  
people’s  lives  and  reporting  back  to  him.  So  Satan  knows  everything  
about everybody in the world.
The Lord told Satan what was outstanding about Job: “There is no-one 
like him on the earth – a blameless and upright man, fearing God and 
turning away from evil?” (1:8). The fear of God – or reverence for God 
– is something that is mentioned much in this first book of inspired 
Scripture.  Here  we  see  that  God  compared  Job  with  other  people  on  
the earth. God does that today too.
In Revelation 12:10 we read that Satan is the accuser of God’s children. 
When he accuses believers to God, he speaks the truth. For example, he 
could  say  to  God:  “See  that  man  there  who  calls  himself  Your  son.  
He   loses his temper. He/she yells at his/her marriage-partner at home. 
He is unrighteous with money. He says he is serving God, but he is only 
interested in making money for himself through his ministry”, etc., etc. 
God being a righteous God, will have to admit that what Satan is saying 
is true. But in the midst of millions of carnal believers who bring dishon-
our to the Name of Christ, how delighted God is when He finds one man 
who is upright. God is looking for people whom Satan cannot accuse in 
any way. Satan cannot accuse anyone who confesses his sin immediately 
to God and thus keeps his conscience clean every moment (Acts 24:16). 
Such  a  person  is  “justified  (declared  righteous  by  God)  because  of  the  
blood of Christ” (Romans 5:9) and he overcomes all of Satan’s accusations 
(Revelation 12:11). Will you be one such person?
Jesus said, “The prince of the world comes and he finds nothing in Me” 
(John 14:30). That was why the Father could say, “This is My beloved 
Son in whom I am well pleased.” The Father was so delighted because 
there was one Person on earth at that time whom He could point out 
to Satan and say, “See how He is walking.” 
1 John 2:6 says, “He who says he abides in Christ must walk as Jesus 
walked.”
It doesn’t matter one bit what our fellow believers think about us. It 
matters everything what God thinks about us. It matters a lot whether God 
can point us to Satan and say in the midst of multitudes of compromising, 

Satan’s Discussion with God                                                                                                                   267
Job
carnal Christians, “Satan, I know that many who call themselves My child-
ren are compromisers and carnal. But have you seen this man who lives 
on that street in that town? He is different. He is upright and sincere. Have 
you seen that woman who lives on that street in that town? She is differ-
ent. She is godly.” And Satan’s mouth is shut – because he knows that 
what God is saying is true. Are you one of those who can shut Satan’s 
mouth, because God can point you out to Satan? 
Whether  you  are  wealthy  or  poor  makes  no  difference.  And  lest  you  
think you have to be poor in order to be spiritual, remember that the very 
first godly person in Scripture mentioned in the very first book of the 
Bible was a very rich man.
In  fact,  that  was  what  provoked  the  jealousy  of  other  people  around  
Job. They couldn’t bear to see somebody who was both rich and spiritual. 
They  would  have  been  happy  if  he  had  been  poor  and  spiritual.  Some  
people  have  the  idea  that  one  has  to  be  poor  in  order  to  be  spiritual.  
The amount of money we have is totally immaterial. It is our attitude to 
the money we have, that matters. Paul and Peter were very poor. So was 
Jesus. But Job and Abraham were very rich. God decides such matters. 
It is like the colour of our skin, or our intelligence level. God determines 
those things too – and they don’t matter. Spirituality has to do with our 
character and not with the size of our bank account. 
It  is  not  surprising  that  Satan  made  Job  his  target,  for  Satan  hates  
upright people. He hated Job in those days – and he hates such people 
even today. That is why he does everything in his power to prevent us 
from  being  godly.  Satan  troubled  Job  through  his  wife  and  through  
carnal preachers. But none of this made any difference to Job’s devotion 
to his God. What a man Job was! What a challenge he is to us! We can 
be like him too.
Let us seek for the approval of God and not that of men. Personally, 
it will not disturb me one bit, even if all 6 billion people in the world 
accuse me falsely of being a heretic, a false prophet, a deceiver, a glut-
tonous  man,  a  drunkard,  a  winebibber,  an  adulterer,  a  thief  or  any  
other evil name they can think of – if only God can point me out to Satan 
and say, “Have you seen Zac Poonen, an upright man who fears Me and 
turns away from all evil.” That commendation from God would mean 
more to me than anything else on earth. I hope you have such a desire 
for yourself too. 
Even Satan’s recognition of us is more important than man’s recogni-
tion of us. Satan recognised that Paul belonged to a different class from 
the sons of Sceva (Acts 19:15).
In the final analysis, when we stand before the Lord, the opinions of 
all the billions of people in the world will count for nothing. Only God’s 
opinion will matter in that day. Even the praises of your fellow-believers 
are fit only to be thrown in the garbage bin. It’s only what God thinks 

268 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
about you that matters. People may praise you to the skies, while God 
thinks nothing of you. On the other hand, people may tear you to pieces 
and  God  may  consider  you  to  be  the  greatest  man  in  your  generation.  
Few  have  the  spiritual  discernment  to  recognise  a  man’s  worth  in  his  
lifetime. So don’t get discouraged if you find people don’t understand 
the way you are going. If God sees that you are humble, He will give you 
grace and you will overcome sin and the world.
Satan  accuses  all  godly  people!  He  has  many  agents  (even  among  
believers)  to  accuse  you.  He  got  people  to  accuse  Jesus  Himself.  Then  
don’t you think he will accuse you as well?
We  read  in  the  book  of  Job that  even  his  three  friends  accused  him.  
The fourth one, Elihu, was milder in his accusations, but he accused Job 
too. Accusation is part of the character of Satan and of his agents. But 
a truly godly man will not allow himself to be affected by those accusa-
tions. Those who have spiritual discernment will be able to recognise a 
godly man, despite what people may say about him.
Three Hedges Around God’s People
Satan  then  told  God,  “You  have  made  a  hedge  around  him and his 
house and all that he has on every side” (verse 10). From what Satan 
said, we learn three great truths. God has put a threefold hedge around 
a godly man: First around him personally, secondly around his family, 
and thirdly around his finances and his property. Satan can see into 
the spiritual realm and knows that. We cannot see those hedges, but 
they are there. 
Satan is a spirit and recognised that he couldn’t get through to attack 
Job  or  his  family  or  his  possessions.  That  is  a  great  comfort  to  me  to  
know that if I live a godly life, there are three hedges around me too. And 
none of those hedges can be opened up without God’s permission. Here 
we find in the book of Job, that Satan had to ask God for permission to 
get through those hedges.
The Lord Jesus told Peter something similar, many years later: “Satan 
has asked for permission to sift you” (Luke 22:31).
God  gave  Satan  permission  to  go  through  one  hedge  at  a  time.  God  
didn’t open up all the hedges at the same time. At first, God allowed 
Satan only to attack Job’s possessions and his family. Later, God permit-
ted Satan to attack Job’s body, but even then He told Satan that he could 
not touch Job’s life. So Satan could not kill Job. Satan would have liked 
to kill Job but he couldn’t. He could only give him boils on his body.
When Hedge Number One was opened up, Satan went in and destroyed all 
of Job’s property. Job’s wealth came down from millions to zero in one day!
Then Hedge Number Two was opened up. Inside this hedge were Job’s 
wife and children. So Satan killed all of Job’s ten children. He could then 
have killed Job’s wife too. But he didn’t, because she was more useful 

Three Hedges Around God’s People                                                                                                      269
Job
to Satan alive than dead! He could use her to nag Job and irritate him. 
A nagging wife (or husband) is a very useful weapon in Satan’s hand – 
and so he would be happy to see such people live long!
There are a few things we can learn about Satan also from the very first 
pages of inspired Scripture.
First  of  all,  Satan  can  only  be  in  one  place  at  one  time.  God  is  every-
where. But if Satan is in one place, he cannot be in another, because 
he is a created being. But he has many demons roaming around on the 
earth to do his work. 
Secondly, Satan cannot see the future. If he could have seen the future, 
he would have known that Job would finally be far more blessed, and 
would  have  left  Job  alone.  If  he  knew  what  would  result  from  Christ  
dying on the cross Calvary, that he himself would be defeated thereby, 
do you think he would have urged people to crucify Christ? Certainly 
not! If Satan knew that Haman himself would hang on those gallows, 
he would not have helped Haman to construct those gallows. He knows 
what people are doing all over the world, and can guess (like we can) 
what the result of those actions will be, but he cannot predict the future.
Thirdly, Satan cannot read your thoughts. He can only see what you are 
doing on the outside. All he could know about Job was on the outside. 
He could not see Job’s thoughts. 
Fourthly, Satan needs God’s permission to attack God’s children. 
It is a great comfort for me to know that this enemy that I am battling 
does  not  know  anything  about  the  future  or  of  my  thoughts  and  is  
totally under God’s restraining control. On top of all that, he has also 
been defeated on the cross now. That takes away all my fear of Satan.
When the second hedge was opened up, Job lost all ten of his children. 
Don’t ever criticise a godly man if you see his children suffering or facing 
problems. Pray for them. His children are targets of Satan, in a way that 
yours may not be – perhaps because you are a compromiser, unlike him. 
And so Satan leaves you and your family alone! 
Now  see  how  Job  reacted  to  all  this.  He  heard  that  everything  had  
been  lost.  One  after  the  other,  his  servants  came  and  told  him  that  
everything was gone. And Job arose, tore his robe, shaved his head, fell 
to the ground and worshipped God (1:20). That’s another thing we see 
on the very first page of inspired Scripture: A godly man is a  worshipper. 
More than knowing the Bible and more than serving the Lord, a man of 
God is primarily a worshipper. You must be a worshipper when you have 
everything and you must be a worshipper when you have lost everything. 
Jesus  said,  “God  is  a  Spirit  and  those  who  worship  Him  must  worship  

270 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
in  spirit  and  truth,  and  the  Father  seeks  for  such  worshippers”  (John 
4:23, 24). To worship God is to give Him everything.
Job  said,  “‘I  came  from  my  mother’s  womb  naked,  and  I  shall  return  
there naked. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the 
name of the Lord.’ Through all this Job did not sin, nor did he blame God.” 
(1:21, 22). Job was probably referring here to Mother Earth from which 
he came naked and to which he will return as dust, naked. He willingly 
accepted whatever the Lord permitted in his life.
When I think of Job’s dedication to the Lord, I am amazed. He did not 
have  the  example  of  Jesus  and  the  apostles  that  we  have.  He  had  no  
examples  whatsoever  to  follow.  He  did  not  have  the  power  of  the  Holy  
Spirit that we have. He did not have the Bible that we have. He did not 
have the encouragement or support of fellow-believers or even of his own 
wife. Job only had God – and God was enough. If Job could come to such 
a glorious life, why can’t we? 
Satan Enters Through the Third Hedge
Chapter  2:  The  devil  was  very  unhappy  because  Job  didn’t  react  the  
way  he  thought  he  would.  The  Lord  told  Satan,  “Have  you  considered  
My servant Job? He still holds fast his integrity even though you incited 
Me against him to ruin him without any reason” (verse 3). Satan replied, 
“That’s  because  he  loves  his  own  life  so  much.  He  doesn’t  care  for  his  
property  or  even  his  children.  He  really  loves  only  himself.  Everything  
that a man has he will give for his life.” Satan knows the selfishness of 
man and it is true of all those who are not disciples of Jesus that they 
will give everything to save their own skin. Man is selfish and in a time of 
pressure, he thinks of himself primarily.
Satan was saying Job was no different. He challenged God, “Now touch 
his body and let me see whether he still will stand true to You.” The Lord 
said, “Go ahead and test him. But you can’t take away his life.” Satan 
went out and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the 
crown of his head. Imagine how terrible it is to get boils from head to foot. 
Job couldn’t live in his house any more. He went outside the town and 
sat on a dung heap, scratching himself among the ashes. And his wife 
came  there  to  nag  him  saying,  “Do  you  still  hold  fast  to  your  integrity?  
Curse this wretched God of yours and commit suicide” (2:9).
Right  at  the  beginning  of  Scripture,  we  see  Satan  tempting  people  to  
commit suicide, and tempting them through their loved ones. Adam was 
tempted  through  Eve.  Job  was  tempted  through  his  wife.  Peter  urged  
Jesus not to go to the cross. Satan can tempt us through our loved ones.
Don’t think that every godly man will have a godly wife. But God can 
use the ungodliness of the wife to make the man’s godliness to stand out 
even more, just as the stars shine brighter as the night grows darker.

Four Preachers                                                                                                                                          271
Job
When Job’s wife suggested suicide, he replied saying, “You speak as a 
foolish woman speaks. Shall we accept good from the Lord and not accept 
adversity?”  (2:10).  I  wish  we  had  more  godly  husbands  like  Job  who  
would stand up to their ungodly wives, instead of trying to please them.
It has been said that when calamity hits you, you must never ask the 
question, “Why does this happen to me?” unless you have asked the same 
question when  some  blessing  came  upon  you!!  When  you  are  blessed  
unexpectedly, do you ever ask, “Why did this happen to me? Why was I 
blessed and not others?”
When Job’s three friends – Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar – heard of his 
adversity,  they  came  to  visit  him,  saying  they  wanted  to  comfort  him  
(2:11). But they didn’t actually comfort him at all, when we see the way 
they spoke to him later on. They only criticised and accused him. All three 
of them were in fellowship with the devil, the accuser of the brethren. 
These three men were jealous of Job, because Job was a godly man, 
and a rich man. and everything was going well for him and for his family.
Many believers are jealous of godly men, when they see their influence 
and ministry – and are often waiting for some calamity to hit them. We 
know that the devil is eager for some calamity to befall godly people. But 
there  are  believers  who  wait  for  that  too,  and  who  are  secretly happy, 
when it happens. 
These three men pretended that they were very sorry for Job. They wept 
when they saw Job and tore their robes and threw dust over their heads. 
They were really good actors. But secretly they were delighted, because 
they were jealous of him. These three preachers only knew about God. 
They didn’t know God personally. That’s why God couldn’t point out any 
of them to Satan.
Godly men suffer attacks from the devil, sometimes from their wives, 
sometimes physically, and at times financially too, as God takes them 
through many trials to sanctify them. But perhaps their greatest trials are 
from their friends and brothers who are jealous of them! Unfortunately 
there is a lot of this in Christian work, where Christian workers hope that 
something bad will happen to a more anointed worker, so that his minis-
try will be destroyed. When God’s blessing and anointing are on a godly 
man,  and  someone  else  is  jealous  of  him,  God  may  allow  some  physi-
cal calamity to come to that man, in order to expose the other person’s 
wicked jealousy. Once the other man’s evil has been exposed, God will 
heal the sickness and restore the godly man to health.
Four Preachers
All three of these men could not truly understand why Job suffered as 
he did. They could only find fault with him. That is because they were 
religious  people  like  the  Pharisees  later  on,  in  Jesus’  time.  There  is  a  
difference between a spiritual man and a religious man. Spiritual people 

272 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
have  been  misunderstood  by  religious people  in  every  generation.  The  
Bible  says  that  “all who  live  godly  in  Christ  Jesus  will  be  persecuted” 
(2  Timothy  3:12).  There  are  no  exceptions  to  this  rule.  So,  if  you  don’t  
want to be misunderstood by other people, then don’t be godly! 
1  Corinthians  2:15  says  that  “a  spiritual  man  cannot  be  discerned  by  
those  who  are  not  spiritual”.  A  godly  man  is  therefore  a  very  lonely  
man – because very few can understand him. His actions are misun-
derstood and his words are misunderstood, even by those who know 
the Scriptures well. Religious people know only facts about God. They 
don’t know God Himself. In the midst of many religious people, one will 
find only a few who know God Himself. Job was one of those rare indi-
viduals. If you are a person who knows God, you will be misunderstood 
by people who only know about God. 
Remember that religious people could not recognise Jesus and thought 
He was the prince of devils. How can they recognise a godly man today? 
There  were  two  religious  groups  in  Jesus’  time,  the  Pharisees  and  the  
Sadducees. The Pharisees were the fundamentalists, and the Sadducees 
were  the  liberals.  But  of  these  two,  the  Pharisees opposed  Jesus  more  
than the Sadducees. In the same way, today, it won’t be the liberals who 
criticise a godly man as much as the fundamentalists. 
But  even  though  a  godly  man  may  be  a  lonely  person  in  this  world,  
God does not forsake him. God allows the trials he faces to give him 
an education. James says, “We count those blessed who endured. You 
have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome or the 
end  of  the  Lord’s  dealings,  that  the  Lord  is  full  of  compassion  and  is  
merciful” (James 5:11). The testimony of every godly man will be: “The 
Lord is full of compassion and is merciful. Even though I could not under-
stand the difficult ways He led me through, it was to fulfil a glorious 
purpose  in  my  life,  and  above  all,  to  glorify  God  in  heaven  where  the  
conflict was going on between God and Satan.”
In the very first book of the Bible, we see the beginning of the modern 
“health and wealth gospel”. Three preachers there told Job that he had 
lost his health and his wealth because he had lost the blessing of God. 
Their  message  was  that  the  blessing  of  God  always  brings  prosperity  
and health. Note that this health and wealth gospel was first preached 
by people who did not know God. It is the same today. Remember that. 
Job who lost all his wealth and his health was in the perfect will of God. 
But  the  three  preachers  who  preached  the  “health  and  wealth”  gospel  
were completely out of the will of God. This is clear from God’s words to 
them: “I am angry with all of you. Ask Job to pray for you, lest I punish 
you” (42:8).

Four Preachers                                                                                                                                          273
Job
The Book of Job is a great encouragement to us because he faced what 
we face today.
The three preachers are not picture of our enemies or even of unbe-
lievers.  They  are  a  picture  of  believers  who  trouble  us,  misunderstand  
us and criticise us. It is always more painful when a believer attacks us 
and accuses us than when an unbeliever does the same things. In the 
last 50 years, I have faced a hundred times more criticism from believ-
ers than I have faced from unbelievers. That is also the history of every 
servant of God in the history of the church. Jesus faced more opposition 
from the Pharisees than from the Greeks and the Romans. Pilate wanted 
to release Him, but Annas and Caiaphas wanted to kill Him. So don’t be 
surprised when you find your maximum opposition coming from believ-
ers who spread false tales about you. They are the followers of Eliphaz, 
Bildad and Zophar.
Let us see what God told these three preachers before looking at what 
they  actually  told  Job.  God  told  Eliphaz  at  the  end:  “I  am  angry  with  
you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of Me what is 
right” (42:7). We must remember these words of God, as we study the 
words of these three preachers. Some of the things they said appear to be 
right. But God said they were totally wrong. 
Why  did  God  say  they  were  wrong?  Because  the  spirit  behind  their  
words  was  wrong.  It  is  the  spirit  behind  our  words  that  matters.  We  
may say the right thing, but if our motive is wrong, God will say that our 
words are wrong. We may be able to justify our words even in a court of 
law. But in God’s eyes, we are wrong, if our attitude or motive is wrong. 
Motive is all-important before God. So, if you plan to say something to 
hurt another person, whatever you say will be wrong.
One more preacher joined Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar towards the end 
– Elihu.
These  four  are  a  picture  of  four  types  of  preachers  in  Christendom  
today.
The first preacher – Eliphaz – was a man who majored on speaking about 
visions and angels. There are preachers like that today who are always 
talking about the angels and visions they have seen, in order to insert 
some  authority  into  their  words.  Eliphaz  told  Job,  “What  I  am  sharing  
with you was given to me in secret. It was whispered in my ears. It came 
in a vision at night when others were sleeping. Fear gripped me. I trembled 
as the power of God came upon me. I shook with terror. A spirit came in 
front of my face. It sent shivers up my spine. It stood still in front of me. 
I couldn’t see the face but I saw the form. Then a voice said, ‘Can mortal 
man  be  upright  before  God?  Can  anyone  be  pure  before  his  Creator?’ ” 
(4:12–17).
The  words  are  absolutely  right:  Can  a  mortal  man  be  upright  before  
God? Can anyone be pure before the Creator? But the spirit was not the 

274 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
Holy  Spirit  –  because  the  Holy  Spirit  doesn’t  bring  fear  and  terror  into  
anyone’s heart. The kingdom of God is righteousness, peace and joy in 
the Holy Spirit. And so the Holy Spirit always brings joy and peace. Don’t 
be  deceived  by  people  who  talk  about  visions  and  dreams  and  spirits.  
They are like Eliphaz. I am not saying that all such people are liars. Such 
visions come from three sources. 
First  of  all,  a  small  percentage  of  visions  and  dreams  do  come  from  
God: The Holy Spirit does give visions and dreams – but they will always 
be in line with God’s Word (Acts 2:17). Those who receive a genuine vision 
however will be reluctant to talk about it. Paul was once taken up to the 
third heaven, but never spoke about it for 14 years – and even then told 
only one church about it – and that too, only to establish his authority to 
write Scripture as an apostle. But we don’t need to establish our author-
ity for such purposes today. And even when Paul did speak about it, he 
said he was not permitted to tell them what he had heard in the third 
heaven. Those are some of the marks of a man who has had a genuine 
vision. 
Secondly,  a  small  percentage  of  visions  come  from  Satanic  sources. 
Those who are desperate to have a vision, in order to get some honour 
before men by speaking about it, and open themselves to Satan will be 
given any number of visions by Satan.
Thirdly, the vast majority of visions come from a person’s own fertile 
imagination. All of us are different as human beings – and some have a 
more fertile imagination than others. All that such people need to do to 
get a vision is to shut their eyes for a few moments and begin to imagine!! 
Immediately  they  begin  to  “see” and  “hear”  things  in  their  mind.  They  
may be quite sincere, but they are deceived about their visions too!
The authority in our words must come from the written word of God, 
and not from any private revelations or visions that we imagine that we 
got from God.
The second preacher – Bildad – believed in following the traditions of the 
fathers. He said, “Consider what our fathers taught us. They are more likely 
to be right than we newcomers. So let us listen to their words” (8:8–10). He 
is typical of yet another group of preachers found in Christendom. These 
people do not wish to disturb any of the traditions that have been handed 
down for hundreds of years in “their church” – whether right or wrong. 
They  don’t  want  visions  or  dreams  –  and  they  don’t  want  any  changes  
either. They don’t want to rock the boat. And they don’t’ want to change 
the direction of the boat either – even if it is going in the wrong direction!!
Bildad was a gentle person, but he still accused Job. There are people 
who have the ability to say really hurting things in a soft and gentle way! 
Their words are smooth but they have the poisonous sting of a serpent in 
them. Husbands and wives can say quiet words to each other that hurt 
more than loud, angry words.

Four Preachers                                                                                                                                          275
Job
The  third  preacher  –  Zophar  –  believed  in  being  angry  and  critical  of  
everything. He was the one who hit out at Job the hardest. He called Job 
a talkative idiot (11:2, 12). He is representative of some “self-appointed 
prophets” who imagine that they are modern-day Elijahs and John the 
Baptists. They are critical of everything they see and constantly hit out 
at one and all. Jesus also criticised the Pharisees. But there is anointed 
criticism and there is carnal criticism. Jesus called the Pharisees vipers. 
Paul called a man an enemy of all righteousness. But God bore witness to 
their words. But if anyone tries to imitate them, God won’t back them up.
James 3:1 (AMP) says, “Don’t be a self-appointed censor of other people’s 
actions.”  A  censor  is  one  who  examines  every  word  that  others  speak.  
The Pharisees were like that. They waited like vultures to catch Jesus in 
something He said in order to accuse him (Mark 12:13; Luke 11:54).
I have met people like that too – who listen to my messages or read my 
books only in order to find something to accuse me of. So such vultures 
are  found  today  too!!  Such  self-appointed  critics  never  do  anything  for  
God themselves but are only interested in focusing their microscopes on 
the words of others who serve the Lord, to find fault with them. Preachers 
who have no anointing on their own ministries often have nothing else to 
do but criticise other anointed preachers. 
Zophar  was  a  self-appointed  censor  like  that.  He  used  harsh,  hard  
words  to  criticise  Job.  He  sought  to  project  himself  as  a  man  radically  
devoted to righteousness. But there was no anointing on what he said.
The  fourth  preacher  –  Elihu  –  was  a  young  zealot  who  had  no  personal  
experience of sorrow or suffering. He was young and full of words but with 
zero experience (32:6, 18). He was better than the other three. He taught 
the truth accurately. And God was not angry with him as God was with 
the other three, because Elihu’s spirit was not evil. Elihu is representa-
tive of those preachers who teach great, wonderful truths but who have 
never  gone  through  the  deep  waters  of  suffering  and  trial  themselves. 
They are pious people who are ready to give advice to others on matters 
of which they have no experience themselves. 
Paul’s ministry came out of suffering. He said “I’ve been through pres-
sure, trials, and tremendous distress; and the strength that God gave me 
in  those  times  is  what  I  can  share  with  you  now”  (2  Corinthians  1:4–8). 
That was a different type of ministry altogether. It came from experience. 
And that is how our ministry should be.
These four preachers that we see in the book of Job are not the type 
of  preachers  that  any  of  us  should  imitate.  They  were  all  “health  and  
wealth” preachers – Elihu being just a little less of that than the others. 
None of them could accomplish anything in their ministry to Job. They 
just wasted everyone’s time, like most preachers do today! 
Three rounds of discussion between Job and the first three preach-
ers are described in detail in Chapters 3–31. Eliphaz and Bildad spoke 

276 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
three times each and Zophar spoke twice. At the end of their discussions, 
Elihu spoke once (Chapters 32–37). Then God spoke in Chapters 38–42. 
That is a broad outline of the book of Job.
We will look at only some of  the significant verses in all these discussions.
First Round of Discussion
Eliphaz basically told Job, “You are suffering because you have sinned”. 
He  didn’t  know  anything  about  Job’s  private  life.  But  he  accused  him  
nevertheless, just like many people do today. “My experience shows that 
those who plant trouble and cultivate evil will harvest the same themselves. 
So  you  are  getting  a  harvest  of  the  evil  that  you  have  cultivated  and  the  
trouble that you have planted in your past life” (4:8). He was totally wrong.
Job replied saying, “People complain when there is no salt in their food. 
Your message is like food without salt and like the uncooked white of an 
egg.” (6:6, 7). He used expressive terms to tell Eliphaz that his sermon 
was tasteless and worthless!
Then Bildad spoke saying, “Your children must have sinned. They obvi-
ously sinned against God. So their punishment is well deserved... If you 
are pure and live in integrity, God will restore your happy home” (8:4, 6). 
Bildad acted like a pious, holy man, who knew all about Job’s children 
(when in fact he knew nothing). Do you criticise other people’s children? 
Do you pretend to be God, knowing why others are suffering? Then you 
are like Bildad.
Job  replied  to  Bildad  saying,  “I  know  this  is  all  true  in  principle.  You  
want me to be perfect before God. But how can a person be perfect in the 
eyes of God? I need His mercy” (9:2, 15). There are many preachers today 
too who preach impractical theories of perfection and sanctification that 
don’t work in real life. Job knew God so well that he knew that what he 
needed was not a theory of sanctification but a living mediator who could 
stand between him and God and bring them both together (9:33). This 
is what he did not have. Today, we have One in Christ. Praise the Lord!
Then  Zophar  spoke  saying,  “Should  I  remain  silent  while  you  babble  
on? God knows those who are false and takes note of all their sins... An 
empty-headed idiot can’t become intelligent any more than a wild donkey 
can produce human children” (11:3, 12). What strong words! Zophar dared 
to call Job (who was the godliest man of his generation) an empty-headed 
idiot! He was venting his anger on someone he was jealous of. There are 
preachers today too who use the pulpit to quote Scripture to vent their 
anger on someone sitting in the congregation, against whom they have 
something.
Job’s  response  to  Zophar  was  one  of  sarcasm: “I  suppose  when  you  
die, there will be no more wisdom in this world. Well, I also know a few 
things myself. And you are no better than I am” (12:1–3). Then Job makes 
one of the most wonderful statement of faith to be found anywhere in the 

Four Preachers                                                                                                                                          277
Job
Old Testament: “Even if God kills me, I will still trust in Him” (13:15). Such 
a statement would be remarkable if made at any time. But when you see 
the circumstances Job was in – not knowing if the next calamity to hit 
him would be death – the statement becomes even more remarkable.
Job  wonders  if  he  is  being  punished  by  God  for  “sins  of  his  youth” 
(13:26). This was something that bothered David too (Psalms 25:7). These 
two godly men – Job and David – had fallen into youthful sins in younger 
days, and those sins were serious enough to bother them decades later. 
Today, we have specific promises from God concerning our sins. If we 
have confessed our sins to the Lord – no matter how serious they were 
–  they  have  been  forgiven  (1  John  1:9).  God  also  promises  us  saying,  
“I will remember their sins no more” (Hebrews 8:12). We overcome Satan’s 
accusations  against  us  “by  the  blood  of  the  Lamb”  (Revelation  12:11). 
But Job did not have that assurance and lived with the awareness of the 
sins of his youth even when he was old enough to be a grandfather. How 
wonderfully  privileged  we  are  under  the  new  covenant.  May  we  never  
forget that.
Second Round of Discussion
In the second round of discussions, we see Eliphaz saying to Job, “You 
are nothing but a windbag... Wicked people are the ones who have pain all 
through their lives. These wicked people may be fat and rich but their cities 
will  be  ruined”  (15:2,  27–28).  Eliphaz  becomes  bolder  now  and  follows  
Zophar’s example of despising Job, and calls him “a bag of hot air”. How 
arrogant he was to say something like that about God’s chosen man.
Job replies, “You all are a bunch of miserable comforters. I could say the 
same things if you were suffering in my place. I could come and preach 
to you like that too” (16:2–5). Job also recognised that Satan was behind 
these attacks, for he says, “My adversary sharpens his eyes against me” 
(16:9 - margin). Satan is always looking at us closely to see if we fail 
in some way so that he can accuse us. His agents on earth (believers 
especially) also sharpen their eyes to observe us when we fall. But Job 
recognised that God allowed this, for he says, “God has handed me over 
to ruffians, and tosses me into the hands of the wicked”  (16:11).  The  
realisation that God allowed all this would have brought some comfort 
to Job. So he goes on to say, “My Advocate is on high. My eye weeps to 
God. O that a Man might plead with God for me” (16:19, 20). How blessed 
we are to know that we have a Man at God’s right hand pleading for us. 
Job also tasted something of the “fellowship of the sufferings of Christ”, 
for he says, “I am one at whom men spit” (17:6).
Then Bildad said, “How long, Job, before you stop talking? Speak some 
sense if you want us to answer. Do you think we are cattle? Do you think 

278 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
we have no intelligence? You may tear out your hair in anger but do you 
think that will make rocks fall off from a cliff? The truth remains that the 
light of the wicked is snuffed out. God snuffs out the light of the wicked. 
The light in their tent will grow dark. The confident stride of the wicked 
will be shortened. The wicked walk into a net. They fall into a pit that God 
has dug for them in their path.” (18:2–8). That was what he was saying, 
implying that Job was wicked.
Job’s reply to that was “Ten times you have tried to insult me now. You 
should  be  ashamed  of  dealing  with  me  so  harshly.  And  even  if  I  have  
sinned,  that’s  my  concern,  not  yours.  God  will  deal  with  that.  Why  are  
you bothered about that? You are trying to overcome me using my present 
humiliation as the evidence of my sin” (19:2–5).
Job goes on to say that God has removed his brothers, relatives, inti-
mate friends, family members and even his wife far from him and made 
him the object of derision of servant-maids and little children (19:13–18). 
But in spite of all that, he goes on triumphantly to say, “I know that my 
Redeemer lives. On the last day He will stand on the earth. Even after my 
skin is destroyed, in my flesh I will see God. I myself will see Him” (19:25–27).  
Job  was  speaking  as  a  prophet  here.  Through  suffering  he  became  a  
prophet. He might never have seen this wonderful vision of the future if 
he had not gone through this intense suffering. That is God’s way. 
This  point,  we  could  say  marks  a  turning  point  in  Job’s  attitude.  
Although he still hasn’t come out of the pit of feeling sorry for himself, 
yet there is a different tone from now onwards. This is what happens to 
us too, when we think of the future and fix our hope on being resurrected 
and seeing our Lord and Redeemer face to face.
The Job warns his preacher friends that there will be a judgement on 
all who accuse God’s servants (19:28, 29).
Then Zophar spoke a second time accusing Job of being a wicked man 
who “oppressed the poor leaving them destitute, and turning them out of 
their homes because they can’t pay their rent”, and also of “being greedy 
and gluttonous” (20:19, 20). He concludes that that is why Job’s “pros-
perity has vanished, disasters have overtaken him and God has given him 
a stomach-full of trouble” (20:22, 23). Zophar’s accusations become more 
vigorous now.
Now  listen  to  the  wisdom  of  Job  in  his  reply.  He  is  calmer  now  and  
more courteous too. The result is that he calms his opponents down too, 
so  that  the  angry  Zophar  does  not  speak  any  more!!  (“A  gentle  answer  
turns away wrath” – Proverbs 15:1).
Job says, “Actually the truth is that wicked people sometimes live to a 
good old age. They are prosperous and see their children and their grand-
children. Their houses are safe, their cattle flourish, and they spend their 
days in merriment and go to the grave” (21:7–13). That is absolutely right. 
Job  was  no  prosperity  preacher.  This  is  exactly  what  we  see  of  wicked  
people around us even today. Job goes on to say that they live like this, 

Four Preachers                                                                                                                                          279
Job
even though they reject God and never serve Him or obey Him and have 
no faith in prayer (verses 14–16). Job goes on to say, “Their prosperity is 
not of their doing” (verse 16) – or in other words, their prosperity was not 
a reward from God for the way they lived. “I will have nothing to do with 
that kind of life,” says Job – a very sensible reply indeed.
Third Round of Discussion
Now we come to the third round of discussion. In this round, only two 
people speak – Eliphaz and Bildad. 
Eliphaz now pretends to have supernatural discernment – like some 
Christians today pretend. Eliphaz was the one who had earlier spoken 
about visions and spirits etc. He now tells Job, “I know what happened. 
You loaned money to a friend of yours and then kept the clothing that he 
gave you as a pledge and didn’t return it. You stripped your friend to the 
bone.  You  refused  water  to  a  thirsty  man  who  came  to  your  house.  You  
refused  food  to  a  hungry  man  who  came  to  your  house.  Some  widows  
came  to  your  home  and  you  sent  them  away  without  helping  them.  You  
crushed the strength of some orphans. These are the reasons why you are 
surrounded today by traps and fears and you are unable to see your way 
forward as God’s waters of judgment cover you. After all, Job, do you think 
the land belongs to the powerful, and to those who are privileged? Because 
you are such an influential man, do you think everything belongs to you? 
And you imagine that God can’t see you or judge you” (Job 22:6–13).
This was all mere imagination. There was not an atom of truth in these 
words.  How  easy  it  is  for  us  to  judge  people  and  to  imagine  the  worst  
about them!
What is Job’s reply? First of all he makes that amazing statement: “He 
knows every detail of what is happening to me. When he has examined 
me, He will pronounce me completely innocent – as pure as solid gold” 
(Job  23:10  -  Living).  Or  as  other  translations  put  it:  “When  he  has  
finished testing me I will come forth as pure gold.” Job was sure that 
God knew every detail of what was happening to him – which was a 
great  comfort  to  him.  But  today  we  have  an  even  greater  assurance:  
God arranges every  detail  of  what  happens  to  us,  making  all  things  
work for our very best (Romans 8:28). Hallelujah!! Job was also sure 
that at the end of this period of testing, he would come forth as refined 
gold. It is amazing to see the light he had even without a Bible.
Job went on to ask, “Why must the godly wait for so long for God to 
judge?”  He  lists  the  injustices  and  humiliations  that  poor  people  and  
widows  face  from  rich,  evil  people  who  exploit  them  in  many  ways.  He  
talks about thieves, murderers and adulterers who seem to get away with 
the sins they commit (24:1–16). But he knows that judgement will catch 
up with them finally (24:18–25).

280 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
Bildad had very little to say now. He merely asks, “How can mortal man 
stand before God and claim to be righteous? Who in all the earth is pure – 
when God is so glorious that even the moon and stars scarcely shine when 
compared to Him?” (25:4, 5).
Job  again  uses  sarcasm  in  reply  saying,  “O  how  you  people  have  
helped powerless people like me! How you have saved people who have no 
strength! O how you have enlightened my stupidity! What wise things you 
have said! Where did you learn all these wise things?” (26:1–3). And then, 
he asks the most searching question of all: “Whose spirit is it that speaks 
through  you?”  (26:4).  He  goes  on  to  speak  about  the  greatness  of  God  
Who “hangs the earth on nothing” and has created so many wonders. He 
then says that all of creation is but “the fringes of His ways” and so how 
little we know about this great God (26:5–14). It is good for all of us to 
remember that so that we don’t have exalted thoughts about ourselves. 
He concludes by saying, “My conscience is clear” (27:6). That is Job’s final 
answer.
Job’s Self-Righteousness
Having  given  his  reply  to  Bildad,  Job  then  goes  on  to  justify  himself,  
giving a list of all the many good things he had done in his life to help 
others  etc.  (Chapters  26–31).  As  we  read  through  these  chapters,  it  is  
amazing  to  see  the  tremendous  light  that  Job  had  about  God  and  His  
ways and the high standard of life that he lived way back in those days 
when there was no Bible and without the indwelling Holy Spirit. It is good 
to look through some things in these chapters, because they put us to 
shame and challenge us to live at a much higher standard today. 
He begins by saying how foolish man is to dig deep for gold but not to 
seek for wisdom (28:1, 12, 13). He goes on to say that “the fear of the Lord 
is wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding” (28:28). Solomon said 
exactly the same thing 1000 years later in Proverbs 9:10. Undoubtedly he 
got that understanding from reading the book of Job.
In Chapter  29,  Job  goes  on  to  speak  about  his  past,  when  he  lived  
in friendship with God, helping the poor, the orphans, the widows, the 
blind, the lame and the needy.
In Chapter 30, he complains that in spite of all the good he had done, 
he was now suffering and had been brought so low by God. 
In Chapter 31, he speaks of the righteousness of his life. He had been 
careful with his eyes not to lust after women (31:1). He had light on 
this sin 2000 years before Jesus spoke about it in Matthew 5. He had 
walked in integrity without any falsehood (31:5, 6), he had never been 
unfaithful to his wife (31:9–12), he had treated his servants with kind-
ness (31:13–15), he had helped the poor and the widows, and brought 
up orphans as his own children (31:16–23), he had not trusted in gold 
or been idolatrous (31:24–28), he had not rejoiced when his enemy was 

Elihu’s Comments                                                                                                                                     281
Job
defeated  (31:29,  30),  he  had  cared  for  strangers  (31:31,  32),  he  had  
confessed his sin whenever he sinned (31:33), he had not been afraid 
of  the  contempt  of  people  (31:34),  and  had  even  cared  for  his  land  
properly (31:38–40). He cries out now to God to answer him (31:35).
We can see in these chapters what a godly man Job was. He had light 
on so many areas of his life and was an extremely helpful man. Yet, he 
did not have light on one thing: Spiritual pride – pride in his  righteousness. 
God loved Job and was determined that Job should have that one virtue 
of humility also before he left this earth. And so in immense love for Job, 
God  took  him  through  this  deep  trial  in  order  to  make  him  both  godly  
and humble.
When the godly apostle Paul was in danger of becoming proud, God took 
Paul also through suffering. He gave him a thorn in the flesh, which 
was a messenger of Satan (2 Corinthians 12:7). Job had a messenger of 
Satan too. But Paul knew why he got it. Job didn’t know. 
That is why God takes many godly people through suffering, misunder-
standing, opposition and persecution – to humble them and break them 
so that He can pour out His grace upon them, for He gives His grace only 
to the humble. 
We  cannot  blame  Job  for  complaining.  He  didn’t  have  a  Bible,  the  
indwelling Holy Spirit, or a brother to encourage him. 
But Paul never complained; and neither need we.
Elihu’s Comments
Now we come to the last preacher, Elihu. He was younger to the other 
three preachers but he was wiser than all of them. But he was unwise 
in another matter. It says that “Elihu’s anger burned and he spoke out” 
(32:5–6).
My advice has always been: “Whenever you are angry, don’t open your 
mouth. Don’t speak to anyone and definitely don’t preach, because the 
anger of man can never achieve the righteousness of God” (See James 
1:20). You can be saved from committing hundreds of sins if you follow 
this  simple  rule.  But  Elihu  did  not  have  that  wisdom.  He  was  angry  
and he spoke. He was angry in a self-righteous way because he said 
Job refused to admit that he had sinned against God.
Basically  all  of  these  preachers  were  saying,  “Job,  you  have  sinned.  
Your  children  have  sinned.  God  knows  that  all  of  you  are  hypocrites.”  
But  the  fact  was  that  none  of  these  preachers  had  the  mind  of  God.  
They had a lot of knowledge – and perhaps Elihu had some more than the 
earlier three. But Elihu was a zealous young man who had never been

through  suffering  himself.  And  when  such  people  begin  to  preach  and  
give advice, all that they say will be mere theory. If Paul had been there, 
he could have explained to Job the reason for his sufferings – because 
Paul had experience. 
Elihu may have been a better man than the others. But without the 
personal  experience  of  trial  and  suffering,  his  ministry  was  shallow.  
Elihu was angry not only with Job but also with the other three preach-
ers (verse 3).
Elihu said some good things that all of us can consider seriously: 
“I am full of words. The spirit within constrains me” (32:18). Our heart 
should always be filled with God’s Word and we should speak only as the 
Holy Spirit constrains us.
“Let me not be partial to anyone or flatter anyone”  (32:21).  God  hates  
partiality and flattery. These two sins must never be found in any of us. 
“No  fear  of  me  should  terrify  anyone.  Nor  should  my  pressure  weigh  
heavily  on  anyone”  (33:7).  No-one  should  ever  be  afraid  of  us  or  be  
terrified by our presence. No-one should ever be forced to act by any 
pressure from us that robs him of his free will.
In Chapter  33:14–30,  Elihu  spoke  some  wonderful  truths  about  the  
three different ways in which God speaks to men: First of all directly once 
or twice (verse 14). If they don’t listen to Him, He then speaks to them 
in dreams at night when they are sleeping (verse 15). If they still don’t 
listen,  then  He  speaks  to  them  by  chastening  them  through  sickness  
(verses 19–22). The purpose of all this speaking is to save man from pride 
and the resultant hell (verses 17, 18). But there has to be a messenger 
to speak and explain all this to man, so that he can pray and confess his 
sins to God and be totally healed and delivered from hell (verses 23–28).
But  Elihu’s  blindness  becomes  manifest  when  he  makes  statements  
such  as  this:  “Has  there  ever  been  a  man  as  arrogant  as  Job?”  (34:7 - 
Living). Or in other words, “From the time of Adam, has there ever been a 
man on the face of the earth who was as proud as Job is?” But what was 
God’s opinion of Job? “There is no man like him on the face of the earth, 
a perfect and an, upright man.” Elihu was so completely out of fellowship 
with God, that his opinion of Job was exactly the opposite of God’s. 
Elihu  was  like  the  Bible  scholars  of  Jesus’  time  –  the  Pharisees,  
Annas and Caiphas – who were sure that Jesus was the prince of devils! 
Unlearned people like Peter, however, knew that Jesus was the Messiah, 
the Son of God. It was not Peter’s cleverness or Bible-knowledge that had 
taught him that. It was God.
Throughout the ages, many clever, religious people have had the exact 
opposite opinion about a godly man to God’s opinion of that man. So don’t 
be discouraged if religious people think that you are wrong. Only a godly 
man can assess the true value of another godly man.

God’s Questions to Job                                                                                                                            283
Job
Elihu went on to say some amazingly true things about God: 
“God  is  almighty,  but  He  does  not  despise  anyone.”  (36:5).  Because  
God is perfect, he despises no-one. We who are imperfect despise other 
human  beings.  The  more  perfect  we  become,  the  more  we  will  be  like  
God, despising no-one!
“Look,  God  is  exalted  beyond  what  we  can  understand.  We  cannot  
imagine the power of the Almighty. Yet He is so just and merciful that 
He does not oppress us. No wonder people everywhere fear Him. People 
who are truly wise will show Him reverence” (36:26; 37:23, 24).
But  then  Elihu  said  some  wrong  things  about  God  too.  He  said,  
“If people listen to God and obey Him, they will be blessed with prosper-
ity throughout their lives. All their lives will be pleasant with health and 
wealth. But if they refuse to listen to God, they will perish in battle and 
die” (Job 36:11, 12). So we see that Elihu was also a “health and wealth” 
prosperity-gospel  preacher.  This  is  the  false  gospel  that  we  hear  from  
many preachers today too.
What was Job’s reply to Elihu? Nothing!
God’s Questions to Job
Then God replied to Job (Chapters 38–41). 
Notice  the  completely  different  way  in  which  God  spoke  to  Job,  
compared to the way the four preachers, (who claimed to represent Him) 
spoke.  God  did  not  once  accuse  Job  of  having  sinned  in  secret  or  tell  
him that he was being punished for his sins, etc. Yet Job was convicted 
immediately and repented!! 
What a lesson we can all learn from that, on how to speak to people and 
how to preach! God’s ways are not our ways. Many preachers try to convict 
people  by  telling  them  about  sins  that  they  imagine  those  others  have  
committed. Nothing results from such an approach, except that the preach-
ers themselves increase their guilt before God for speaking with the spirit 
of the Accuser. God in His great mercy and compassion, however, speaks 
to man in quite another way – and the man is so thoroughly convicted of 
his sins that he says, “O God, I am corrupt, I am nothing. I repent. Please 
forgive me.” God leads people to repentance by His kindness (Romans 2:4).
Three basic questions that God was asking Job (in these chapters) were:
1. “If you can’t understand these wonders in creation, how can you under-
stand spiritual realities?” 
2. “If I control all My creation, do you think that I couldn’t control the light-
ning that struck your sheep, or the Sabeans and Chaldeans who killed 
your servants, or the storm that struck your children’s houses?” 
3. “If  you  can’t  stand  in  front  of  a  crocodile  that  I  created,  how  can  you  
stand before Me?” (41:10).

284 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
God  showed  Job  His  sovereign  power  and  control  over  all  of  creation.  
That  was  all  that  needed  to  be  said.  And  Job  was  humbled.  Hours  of  
direct attack by the four preachers accomplished nothing. The indirect 
approach by God accomplished everything in a few minutes. Faith in the 
sovereign control of God over all of His creation, is what will bring rest to 
our hearts too, when we face problems, afflictions and enemies.
The  Lord  asked  Job,  “Do  you  still  want  to  argue  with  the  Almighty?” 
(Job 40:2). Job, who had a quick reply for every argument thus far is 
now silenced. He now says, “Lord, I am nothing and I have nothing to 
say. I will not speak any more” (40:4, 5).
This first book of inspired Scripture teaches us that God wants us to 
recognise our nothingness so that He can be everything in our lives. Then 
our lives will fulfil His purpose and be a blessing to multitudes. Before 
God can use someone, He has to reduce him to nothing. 
Paul said “What is Paul and what is Apollos? I planted, Apollos watered, 
but God was causing the growth. So neither the one who plants nor the one 
who waters is anything” (1 Corinthians 3:5, 6). In other words, the one who 
does  evangelism  is  nothing and  the  one  who  does  Bible  teaching  is  also  
nothing.  God  alone  is  everything  and  so  He  alone  deserves  all  the  glory. 
That was the secret of Paul’s life – he was a zero even at the end of his life.
There are preachers who are eager to grab the credit for souls saved 
somewhere. There are pastors who complain saying, “That other pastor 
stole my sheep  from  my church”,  etc.  Why  do  they  speak  like  that?  
Because they haven’t become zeros as yet. When they say, “my church”, 
which church are they talking about? We know of the church of Jesus 
Christ. But which is their church? Everybody must certainly be taken 
away from “their church” and planted in the church of Jesus Christ!! And 
“their church” must be destroyed. 
What  a  long  time  it  took  Job  to  come  to  the  place  where  he  could  
acknowledge that he was insignificant and decide never to justify himself 
any more. Thereafter, for the rest of his life, Job must have been a man 
who was “quick to hear and slow to speak” (James 1:19). The long speech 
that  he  gave  in  six  chapters  (Chapters  26  to  31)  is  the  longest  self-  
justification found in the entire Bible. It stinks of self-righteousness all 
the way through. But Job could not smell his pride himself.
Now  at  last  this  self-righteous  man  had  become  zero.  As  a  result  of  
whose  preaching?  Was  it  through  the  man  who  spoke  of  visions  and  
dreams? Was it through the man who held the traditions of the fathers as 
sacred? Was it through the self-appointed “prophet”? Or was it through 
the man who was so correct in what he said? None of these four preach-
ers  could  help  him.  It  was  God  Who  helped  Job  to  come  to  this  place.  
He was the Fifth Preacher. And He is the One Whom we should imitate. 
“Be imitators of God” (Ephesians 5:1).

God’s Questions to Job                                                                                                                            285
Job
What  a  wonderful  thing  God’s  brief  message  did  to  Job,  which  the  
other preachers could not do with all their long and repeated sermons. 
What  was  the  reason  for  this?  The  answer  is:  God  loved  Job.  The  four  
preachers did not. When we love people from our heart, God will give us 
the right words to give them. When we don’t love them, we will only criti-
cise them and accuse them and we won’t be able to bless them. Let us 
learn then to love the people we serve, and God will always give us the 
words to speak to them.
A prophet of God must have God’s word in his heart and God’s people 
on his heart. Then God will give him prophetic messages for them. 
While  the  other  four  preachers  tried  to  convict  Job  of  his  sin,  God  
sought to make Job a worshipper. And God succeeded. As the Christian 
church in India, this is what we need to show an unbelieving generation 
– that our God is the Almighty and Sovereign Ruler of this universe. We 
are not to be intimidated by the threats of our opponents – for not a hair 
of our heads can be touched by anyone without our Sovereign, Heavenly 
Father’s permission.
Let us learn to act with compassion, instead of always being ready to 
criticise.  Let  us  never  pass  judgement  when  we  do  not  know  the  true  
facts. Even when we think we know the facts, let us acknowledge that 
there may be other facts that we still don’t know. So let us always humble 
ourselves  and  say,  “Lord,  I  am  nothing.  I’ll  put  my  hand  over  my  mouth  
and keep quiet.”
Job also said, “Lord, I had heard about You before, but now I have seen 
You” (Job 42:5). There is a vast difference between hearing about God and 
knowing Him personally. When John saw Jesus on the isle of Patmos, he 
fell down and worshipped Him. Job fell down and worshipped God too. 
Job also repented radically of his accusing God and took back every 
word he had spoken (42:6). And God forgave him immediately as we 
see very soon thereafter.
Then the Lord said to Eliphaz, “I am angry with you and your two friends. 
Now offer a sacrifice for your sin (of speaking to My servant Job) and ask 
My  servant  Job  to  pray  for  you.  He  whom  you  accused  has  to  be  your  
mediator now.” Notice how God recognises Job as His servant (42:7, 8).
The Lord told the church in Philadelphia, “I will make them to come and 
bow down at your feet and to know that I have loved you” (Revelation 3:9). 
The same thing happened here with Job and his friends.
Job had said many things against God. But the moment he repented 
and retracted those, he was forgiven and all those words were blotted out 
from God’s record. Only the good things that Job had said were left on 
the record!

286 Through the Bible: The Problem of Suffering
Job
Those good things were statements such as:
“Even if God kills me, I will trust in Him” (13:15).
“I know that my Redeemer lives and He will stand on the earth on the 
last day. And after my body has decayed in my body I will see God with 
my own eyes” (19:25).
“He knows every detail of what is happening to me” (23:10 - Living).
These are a few of the tremendous confessions of faith that Job made. 
The angry words he had spoken had all been wiped out. This is a great 
encouragement to us. Today we know that the blood of Christ has such 
power that there is no record of any of the sins that we have repented of 
and confessed to God. Only the good confessions of faith that we made 
will be found in God’s record now.
Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar then went to Job and asked him to pray 
for  them.  Job  readily  forgave  them  and  prayed  for  them.  I  don’t  know  
whether those preachers actually repented. But in any case they did not 
want to be judged by God. 
As soon as Job prayed for his friends, the Lord restored Job’s fortunes 
(42:10). Soon he had received double from the Lord of everything he had 
lost.
He even got ten more children. And that suggests to me that, after his 
wife saw how good God had been to their family, she also repented and 
became a godly woman herself and a true helper to her husband.
So, “love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who 
curse you and pray for those who persecute you”. And you will find a 
miracle beginning to take place in your own life. You will find yourself 
being doubly blessed by the Lord.
Here then are some of the glorious truths that we can learn from the first 
book of inspired Scripture:
1. God looks all over the earth for godly men who will worship Him.
2. Godly men and their families become targets of Satan’s attacks. 
3. Satan can attack us only after getting God’s permission.
4. A godly man may have a difficult wife. But God can change her.
5. Godly men will be misunderstood by religious people. 
6. The actions of godly men are closely watched by both God and Satan. 
7. The pathway to perfection is through suffering and misunderstanding. 
8. Health and prosperity are not the marks of God’s blessing.
9. When we see God as He really is, we will see ourselves as nothing.
10. God plans all things for our ultimate good.

PSALMS
Trusting God and Worshipping Him
T
he book of Psalms is quoted more often in the New Testament than 
any other Old Testament book. Out of the 150 psalms, quotations 
from  at  least  50  of  them  are  found  in  the  New  Testament.  Jesus  
quoted often from the Psalms. 
The Book of Psalms is divided into five sections, each closing with a 
benediction.
• Book 1 – Psalms 1–41
• Book 2 – Psalms 42–72
• Book 3 – Psalms 73–89
• Book 4 – Psalms 90–106
• Book 5 – Psalms 107–150
More than 70 of the psalms were written by David, some were written by 
Asaph, some by the sons of Korah, two by Solomon, one by Moses, one 
by Heman, and one by Ethan. The other authors are unknown.
The  book  of  Psalms is  divided  into  5  books.  The  first book  is  from  
Psalm 1 to 41. The second book is from Psalm 42 to 72. The third book 
is  from  Psalm  73  to  89.  The  fourth book  is  from  Psalm  90  to  106,  and  
the fifth book  is  from  Psalm  107  to  150.  Many  subjects  are  covered  in  
each of these five books. But some people compare these five books of 
the psalms to the first five books of Moses – and there is some similarity 
between them.
Many of the psalms contrast the lot of the righteous with that of the 
wicked. A theme that is found frequently in many of the psalms is asking 
God for deliverance from one’s enemies. 72 of the 150 psalms have some 
reference to the psalmist’s enemies. 
We will look at some psalms in greater detail, but only at the theme or 
some important verses in the others.

288 Through the Bible: Trusting God and Worshipping Him
Psalms
The First Book – The Righteous and the Wicked
Psalm  1  is  an  introduction  to  the  whole  book  of  Psalms.  This  psalm  
describes the blessed man who avoids sinful paths and meditates on God’s 
Word. It is not enough to avoid evil. The heart that has been cleansed of 
evil must be filled with God’s Word. To meditate on God’s Word day and 
night means to think frequently of the word that we have read and to let 
it sink into our hearts – just like the food we eat is digested over a period 
of many hours and converted into blood, flesh and bones. We spend very 
little  time  actually  eating.  It  is  the  digestion  process  that  goes  on  for  
hours.  So  we  may  spend  only  a  short  while  reading  God’s  Word.  But  
meditation on it is important. If we do that, we will be like trees planted 
by a river that are always fruitful and whatever we do will prosper. The 
blessing  of  God  will  be  upon  the  work  of  our  hands  and  the  words  we  
speak. This is the way God wants all of us to live. 
Psalm 2 is a Messianic psalm that speaks of the reign of Christ. There 
are at least 18 prophecies about the Messiah (Christ) in 13 of the psalms. 
This one is about Messiah ruling as the King. The King is rejected by the 
world (verses  1  to  3  –  Peter  quotes  these  verses  in  Acts  4:25,  26).  But  
“He who sits in the heavens will laugh” (verse 4). And God says, “Thou art 
My Son. Ask of Me and I will give You the heathen for your inheritance, the 
uttermost parts of the earth for your possession. You shall break them with 
a rod of iron” (verses 7–9). One day, Jesus will rule over the earth. We are 
urged to “kiss the Son” before that day.
Psalm 3 was written by David when he was ousted by his son Absalom 
and had to escape from Jerusalem. He expresses his trust in God here. 
He says, “Lord, You are my Glory and the Lifter of my head” (verse 3). We 
usually sing that verse in a comfortable building on a Sunday morning. 
David sang it while he was escaping for his life from Absalom!! Many of 
these psalms were written by David, not when he was in his palace, but 
when he was under pressure, running from cave to cave. Many of these 
inspired  psalms  would  never  have  been  written  if  David  had  not  faced  
pressure.  Some  of  the  greatest  lessons  God  teaches  us  are  in  times  of  
pressure. It is through pressure that God makes us a blessing to others. 
It is when a tube of toothpaste is squeezed that the paste comes out. God 
also squeezes us through our enemies, so that His word comes forth from 
us. The more the pressure, the richer our ministry becomes.
Psalm 4 is an evening prayer (4:8). The previous psalm was a morning 
prayer (3:5). Both express faith in God’s protecting power. “The Lord has 
set apart the godly for Himself” (verse 3). We have been taken out of the 
world  and  set  apart  by  God  to  be  exclusively  His.  Then  we  are  warned  
against the sin of anger: “Tremble (with anger) but don’t sin,” (verse 4 - 
NASB margin). Then it goes on to say, “Meditate in your heart upon your 
bed and be still”. Under the old covenant, they could not overcome anger. 

The First Book – The Righteous and the Wicked                                                                                 289
Psalms
So  they  were  urged  to  lie  down  on  their  beds  until  they  calmed  down.  
And on their beds, they were to “offer the sacrifices of righteousness to the 
Lord” (verse 5) – and to get up only when their anger had been replaced 
with  gladness,  and  they  could  say  “Lord,  You  have  put  gladness  in  my  
heart”  (verse  7).  That  is  good  practical  advice  for  Christians  also,  who  
have not yet overcome anger. In the new covenant, that verse is quoted in 
Ephesians 4:26 thus, “Be angry but do not sin”. But then we are exhorted 
to “put away all anger” (Ephesians 4:31). This is our privilege under the 
new covenant.
Psalm 5 is a prayer for protection from enemies. “In the morning O Lord 
Thou  wilt  hear  my  voice.  In  the  morning  I  will  order  my  prayer  to  Thee” 
(verse 3) – a good way to begin every morning. “Let those who put their 
trust in Thee rejoice because Thou defendest them” (verse 11). 
Psalm 6 is a prayer for God’s mercy. “All my enemies shall be ashamed 
and greatly dismayed” (verse 10) – a confession of faith.
Psalm 7 is a prayer for God to vindicate. David has a clear conscience: 
“Lord, if there is injustice in my hands, if I have rewarded evil to those who 
were  at  peace  with  me,  then  let  my  enemy  persecute  me.”  (verses  3–5). 
It   is a very serious thing to do evil to others. There are two types of sins 
– sins where you harm yourself and sins where you harm others. Drug-
addiction and smoking are sins by which one harms oneself. Gossiping, 
however, destroys the reputation of others. So gossiping is more serious. 
“God  is  angry  with  such  wicked  people  every  day”  (verse  11).  But  how  
many Christians believe that?
Psalm 8 compares the littleness of man with the greatness of God. This 
is yet another Messianic psalm. Jesus quoted from it when the children 
were praising Him in the temple and the Pharisees were upset with their 
noisy  praise:  “Out  of  the  mouth  of  infants  and  nursing  babes  Thou  hast  
prepared praise for Thyself” (Matthew 21:16). The Pharisees, like many 
Christians today, believed that they should worship God in funeral-like 
solemnity and not with noisy praise and worship! But Jesus enjoyed the 
children’s  praise,  because  it  reminded  Him  of  heaven  which  is  full  of  
noisy praise and worship! Notice that where verse 2 here uses the word 
“strength”, Jesus used the word “praise”. The purpose of this is said to 
be “to silence the enemy” (verse 2). By praising God, we become strong 
to shut Satan’s mouth. Sincere praise that comes from the heart is what 
the devil hates. Verse 4: “What is man that Thou are mindful of him? Thou 
hast made Him a little lower than the angels” is quoted in Hebrews 2:6–8 
– a reference to Jesus having taken a place lower than angels for a while 
– because  He  died, whereas  angels  don’t  die. But  now  Jesus  has  been  
crowned with glory and honour, and all things are under His feet. And 
since we are His Body, everything is under our feet too. 

290 Through the Bible: Trusting God and Worshipping Him
Psalms
Psalm  9  is  a  prayer  of  thanksgiving  to  God  for  punishing  his  enemies.  
“Those  who  know  Thy  Name  (the  Name  of  Jesus)  will  put  their  trust  in  
Thee because Thou has not forsaken them.” (verse 10). God is the God of 
resurrection: “Thou Who dost lift me up from the gates of death” (verse 13).
Psalm 10 is a prayer asking God to destroy the wicked. “The wicked one 
through the pride of his face will not seek after God. But God is the One 
who  cares  for  the  fatherless  and  the  oppressed  people  of  the  earth  so  
that the evil men of the world may not oppress or terrify them any more” 
(verses 4, 18).
Psalm  11  is  about  the  Lord  protecting  the  righteous.  It  says  here  that  
God tests both the righteous and the wicked (verse 5). And He hates the 
one who seeks to harm others. When God tests us, He seeks to promote 
us to a higher class – just as a student writes an examination in order to 
be promoted. 
Psalm 12 is a psalm about the use of the tongue. It begins by saying that 
faithful, godly people are becoming fewer and fewer. And then it goes on 
in the next three verses to speak about the tongue – falsehood, flattery, 
insincerity and arrogance are expressed through the tongue. A primary 
mark  of  a  godly  man  is  the  graciousness  of  his  speech.  The  ungodly,  
however,  say,  “Our  lips  are  our  own.  We  will  speak  whatever  we  like.” 
(verse 4). It is the man who can control his tongue who is a perfect man 
(James 3:2). A godly man recognises that “the words of the Lord are pure 
words, like silver tested in a furnace seven times” (verse 6). So before he 
speaks,  he  thinks  about  what  he  is  going  to  say.  If  he  is  in  doubt,  he  
throws the words he is planning to speak, into the furnace of his heart 
and  asks  himself  a  few  questions:  “Is  it  necessary  for  me  to  say  this?  
Can I put it in a gentler way? Am I speaking the truth? Am I speaking in 
love?” etc. Then he decides what to say and how to say it. If he is writing 
a  letter  to  correct  someone,  he  will  rewrite  it  seven  times  if  necessary,  
before sending it. 
Psalm  13  is  a  prayer  asking  the  Lord  for  help  in  trouble.  It  concludes  
with, “I will sing to the Lord because He has dealt bountifully with me.”
Psalm  14  describes  the  wicked  man.  Every  atheist  is  a  fool  (verse  1). 
Verses  2  and  3  describe  the  condition  of  fallen  man  and  are  quoted  in  
Romans 3:10–12. 
Psalm 15 describes the qualifications for a man to live in God’s presence. 
He must speak the truth in his heart. He must honour those who fear 
God. In the church of God, we do honour people – but not as in the world, 
because they are rich or famous, but because they fear God. Go through 
this  psalm  slowly  and  examine  your  heart  in  its  light,  for  it  says  that  
those who live like this “will never be shaken” (verse 5). Many things are 
going to be shaken in the world soon. But this man will never be shaken.

The First Book – The Righteous and the Wicked                                                                                 291
Psalms
Psalm 16 is another Messianic psalm where David says that the Lord and 
the saints are all that he wants. In verse 3, he says that he delights in 
God’s people! All men will know that we are the disciples of Jesus when 
they see that we love one another. Verse 8, “I have set the Lord always 
before me. Because He is at my right hand, I will never be moved”, was 
quoted by Peter, as referring to the Lord Jesus (Acts 2:25). We are to follow 
Jesus’ example and set the Lord before our face always in everything that 
we  say  or  do.  Then  He  will  be  at  our  right  hand  to  support  us  too.  In 
God’s presence, there is “fullness of joy”, and at His right hand there are 
eternal pleasures (verse 11). Joy and pleasure are found in their purest 
form  only  in  God’s  presence  where  they  are  eternal.  Earthly  joys  and  
pleasures are shallow and short-lived.
Psalm  17  is  another  psalm  where  David  asks  for  protection  from  his  
oppressors. Verse 15 speaks of the resurrection morning, when we will 
“behold the Lord’s face in righteousness, and be satisfied with His like-
ness.” That can mean two things: that we will be satisfied when we see 
Him and also that we will be satisfied when we are like Him. Our blessed 
hope is dual – to see Him and be like Him (1 John 3:2).
Psalm18 is another psalm of deliverance. Verses 16 to 19 are a beautiful 
picture  of  our  salvation.  “He  will  enlighten  our  darkness  and  make  our  
way perfect” (verses 28, 32). This psalm is quoted fully in 2 Samuel 22.
Psalm 19 speaks of the works of God and the word of God. There are two 
testimonies  to  God  on  earth.  One  is  the  heavens  (verses  1–5),  and  the  
other is His written word (verses 7–11). In verses 12 and 13, David asks 
God to keep him from four types of sins – errors, secret sins, presump-
tuous sins, and the great sin – each progressively more serious than the 
previous one. And finally, here is one sin that we can keep ourselves from 
– sins of speech. “Lord, let the words of my mouth and the meditation of 
my heart be acceptable in Your sight” (verse 14).
Psalm 20 is a prayer for victory over one’s enemies. David’s confidence 
is in God alone: “Some trust in chariots and some in horses (today, some 
trust in money and some in man’s help) but we will trust in the Name of 
the Lord.” (verse 7).
Psalm 21 is a psalm of praise to God for granting deliverance. “Thou hast 
given him his heart’s desire and not withheld the request of his lips. He 
asked life of Thee, and You gave him eternal life” (verses 2, 4).
Psalm 22 is another Messianic psalm with prayer and praise. This psalm 
and the next two are “Shepherd” psalms. Psalm 22 speaks about the past 
(the cross), Psalm 23 speaks about the present (the Lord as our Shepherd 
now) and Psalm 24 speaks about the future (when Jesus will reign as the 
King of Glory). Verse 1 here is what Jesus said on the cross: “My God, My 
God, why have You forsaken Me?” On the cross, Jesus was like a worm 

292 Through the Bible: Trusting God and Worshipping Him
Psalms
and poured out like water (verses 6, 14). Dogs surrounded Him and they 
divided  His  garments  (verses  16,  18).  But  in  verse  22,  we  come  to  the  
resurrection: “I will declare Your name to My brothers.” Jesus called His 
disciples His brothers directly for the first time on the day of His resur-
rection (John 20:17). This verse is also quoted in Hebrews 2:12 in this 
context. It goes on to say, “I will praise You in the midst of the congregation 
(church). You who fear the Lord, praise Him” (verses 22, 23). Jesus is the 
One Who leads us in praising the Father in the church. Only those who 
fear the Lord are exhorted to praise the Lord, for only their praise will be 
sincere. We see the result of the work of the cross and the resurrection in 
verses 22 to 30: There we have three verses on praising God (verses 22, 
23, 26) and two verses on worshipping God (verses 27, 29), followed by 
one verse on service (verse 30). So it is praise, praise and praise, followed 
by worship and worship, and then service. How few have understood the 
importance of praise and worship as a preparation for effective service!
Psalm 23 is the Shepherd psalm. When the Lord is our Shepherd, we will 
lack nothing (verse 1). HE makes us to lie down. HE leads us. HE restores 
us. HE guides us. Very often we think about what we have to do for the 
Lord. But here the emphasis is on what the Lord does for us. We can be 
effective for God only as we allow Him first to do a work in us. We fear no 
evil, because HE is with us. HE prepares a table for us and HE anoints 
our  head  with  oil.  Then  our  cups  begin  to  run  over  and  goodness  and  
mercy follow us everywhere until we reach our eternal home.
Psalm 24 is a prophetic psalm referring to the time when Jesus will reign 
on earth as King and “the earth will be the Lord’s”. It describes those who 
will dwell with him in His holy hill then (verses 1, 3). It goes on to urge 
people to welcome the Lord, the King of glory, Who has won the battle 
against the forces of evil.
Psalm  25  is  a  psalm  about  guidance  and  protection.  David’s  prayer  is,  
“Lord,  show  me  Your  ways.  Teach  me  Your  paths”  (verse  4). Guidance 
is  promised  to  those  who  acknowledge  that  they  are  sinners (verse  8), 
who humble  themselves  (verse  9), who obey  His  testimonies  (verse  10), 
who fear Him (verse 12), and who look to Him (verse 15). God reveals His 
secrets to those who reverence Him (verse 14).
Psalm  26:  Here  David  proclaims  his  integrity  to  the  Lord  and  asks  for  
protection from his enemies. When our conscience is clear, we can boldly 
ask God to defend us.
Psalm 27 is a psalm of fearless trust in God. Here David proclaims that 
he will not fear, “even if a host encamps around him”, because the Lord 
is  his  defence  (verses  1–3). David  desired  only  one  thing  from  the  Lord  
– to see the beauty of the Lord and to dwell in God’s temple at all times 
(verse 4). This should be the only thing that we desire too.

The First Book – The Righteous and the Wicked                                                                                 293
Psalms
Psalm  28  is  a  prayer  for  God’s  help  followed  by  praise  for  His  quick  
answer. The Lord is David’s strength and shield (verse 7).
Psalm 29 is about the voice of the Lord. It is mentioned seven times. We 
have  seen  the  importance  of  hearing  God’s  voice  right  from  Genesis  1. 
“Everything in God’s temple (church) says, ‘Glory’ ” (verse 9).
Psalm 30 is a psalm of thanksgiving for being saved from death. “Thou 
hast  turned  my  mourning  into  dancing  for  me  that  my  tongue  may  sing  
praise to You and never be silent.” (verses 11, 12). We should never stop 
praising God for all His deliverances.
Psalm  31  is  yet  another  cry  for  help  followed  by  praise.  “How  great  is  
God’s goodness to those who fear Him, who trust in God publicly before 
the sons of men. You will hide them in the secret place of Your presence 
from the conspiracies of men. You will keep them secretly in a shelter from 
the strife of tongues” (verses 19–20). That is the best place for us to hide 
ourselves – in His presence – from all the wagging tongues of our enemies 
around us.
Psalm 32 speaks of the blessedness of being forgiven and having one’s sin 
covered. That is blessed indeed, but not as blessed as it is for us under 
the new covenant where our sins are cleansed. There was no cleansing 
of sin under the old covenant. The blood of bulls and goats could only 
cover sin,  whereas  the  blood  of  Jesus  cleanses us.  Sin  being  covered  
can be pictured thus: Our sins are all written on a blackboard and then 
covered with a sheet. But if you lift the sheet, the sins can still be seen. 
Cleansing, however, is like wiping them all out with a wet sponge! David 
recognised that his sickness was due to unconfessed sin (verse 4). When 
he confessed it, he was healed. There is “a period when the Lord can be 
found” and we should pray to Him during that time – this present time of 
grace (verse 6). The Lord also promises to teach us and guide us (verse 8).
Psalm  33  proclaims  the  Lord  alone  as  the  help  of  His  people.  “The  eye  
of the Lord is constantly on those who fear Him to deliver them and keep 
them alive even in times of famine” (verses 18, 19).
Psalm 34 describes the Lord as the Helper of the righteous. David wrote 
this  psalm  when  the  Lord  delivered  him  from  certain  death,  as  he  
pretended to be mad in front of King Abimelech. So he says, “I will bless 
the Lord at all times. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him. Taste 
and  see  that  the  Lord  is  good.”  (verses  1,  6,  8).  David  recognised  that  
“the angel of the Lord surrounds those who fear Him and delivers them” 
(verse 7). He also saw that “the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous 
and  His  ears  are  always  open  to  their  cry”, and  that  “the  Lord  is near 
the brokenhearted” (verses 15, 18). David goes on to say from his expe-
rience  that  “the afflictions of the righteous are many”  (verse  19).  Don’t  
ever imagine that if you are righteous you won’t have problems. You will 

294 Through the Bible: Trusting God and Worshipping Him
Psalms
have more problems. “But the Lord will deliver you out of ALL of them” 
(verse 19). Then there is yet another Messianic prophecy: “He keeps all 
His bones; not one of them will be broken” (verse 20) – which was fulfilled 
on the cross.
Psalm 35 is another prayer asking the Lord to fight against one’s enemies. 
Malicious  witnesses  had  risen  up  against  David,  even  though  he  had  
been good to them in the past (verse 11–21). This was the experience of 
Jesus too, who had been good to Judas Iscariot. This has been the expe-
rience of many saints also.
Psalm  36  contrasts  the  wickedness  of  men  and  the  goodness  of  God.  
“Those who trust in Him will drink their fill of the abundance of God’s 
house” (verse 8). Verse 9 is a very important verse: “In Thy light we see 
light.” This teaches that we should never look inside ourselves, because 
that only leads to condemnation. Only as we come into God’s light can 
we really see our true condition. And then we will never feel condemned.
Psalm 37 deals with the blessedness of the righteous and the destruction 
of the wicked. The righteous person is described not just as one who does 
the right thing, but who also “delights himself in the Lord”. Such a person 
gets “the  desires  of  his  heart”  (verse  4).  The  steps of  such  a  man  are  
ordered by the Lord. And as has been said, “The stops of a good man are 
also ordered by the Lord.” God leads His people forward step by step and 
at times tells them to stop. When such a man falls, it won’t be serious, 
because the Lord holds his hand (verses 23, 24). If we wait patiently for 
the Lord, we “will inherit the land” (verse 34). As Jesus said, the meek will 
inherit the earth.
Psalm 38: Here David asks the Lord to hurry up and help him, because 
he is sick and also being attacked by his enemies. 
Psalm 39 speaks about the shortness of life and ends with a prayer for 
mercy. “Lord, make me to know my end. Let me know how transient I am” 
(verse  4). David  recognises  that  God  chastens  people  in  order  to  save  
them from their sin (verse 11). 
Psalm 40 speaks of the wonders God does for His servants and asks for 
deliverance  from  one’s  enemies.  This  is  yet  another  Messianic  psalm.  
Verses 6 to 8 are quoted in Hebrews 10:5–7. But notice one big differ-
ence. David could only say, “I delight to do Thy will, O God”. Jesus went 
further and said, “I have come to do Thy will O God.” This is the difference 
between what people under the old covenant could achieve and what we 
under the new covenant can attain to. Those saints could only delight in 
God’s will. We can actually do it.
Psalm 41 asks for healing and victory over one’s enemies. The Lord blesses 
anyone who cares for poor people – both the financially poor (who need 
money) and the spiritually poor (who need the gospel). The Lord promises 

The Second Book – An Oppressed People Delivered                                                                          295
Psalms
to  deliver  such  a  man  from  trouble,  protect  him  from  his  enemies  and  
heal  him  when  he  is  sick.  In  the  second  half  of  the  psalm,  David  asks  
God  for  help  from  his  enemies  –  including  a  close  friend  who  ate  with  
him. This verse is quoted in John 13:18 as referring to Judas Iscariot. In 
verse 11, David says that the only proof that God is pleased with him is 
that his enemies are defeated. In our case, this would refer to victory over 
the lusts in our flesh. 
The Second Book – An Oppressed People Delivered
The first eight psalms in this book (Psalms 42 to 49) were written by the 
sons  of  Korah  who  escaped  death  by  leaving  their  father  Korah’s  side,  
when  he  rebelled  against  Moses  in  the  wilderness  (Numbers  26:9–11). 
Whether written by the first generation or a later generation of Korah’s 
sons, none of these psalms would have been written, if Korah’s sons had 
not  stood  against  their  father  in  his  rebellion.  They  stood  with  God’s  
anointed leader, Moses. What a lot of God’s plans people can miss, if they 
do not stand with Divinely appointed authority. 
Psalm  42  is  about  a  soul  thirsting  after  God  “as  the  deer  pants  after  
water” (verse 1). When you have that type of longing after God, you can 
be  certain  that  God  will  answer  very  quickly.  “Deep  calls  unto  deep” 
(verse  7). That refers to something deep in our heart reaching out to the 
depths of God’s heart. And if we are like that, then even if people around 
us say, “Where is your God?” (verse 10), we can still trust God, praise Him 
and overcome discouragement (verse 11). 
Psalm 43 is a prayer for guidance and deliverance. “Lord, send out Your 
light and Your truth. Let them together lead me to Your holy hill” (verse 3). 
The psalmist is asking for light (revelation) and not just knowledge of the 
truth. Only the light of God on His truth will show us the way into His 
presence.
Psalm  44  is  a  prayer  to  God  to  work  now  as  He  did  in  former  times.  
Verse 22 – “For Your sake we are killed all day long; we are considered as 
sheep to be slaughtered” – is a prophetic reference to the way of the cross 
that we have to walk today and is quoted by Paul in Romans 8:36, 37.
Psalm  45  is  another  Messianic  psalm  that  speaks  about  the  marriage  
of  the  Lamb  and  describes  the  bride  and  the  Bridegroom.  The  bride  is  
described  as  being  glorious  within  (verse  13)  –  on  the  inside.  That  is  
where we should be glorious. And in verse 10, we have a word from God 
to all brides as to what to do after marriage. “Forget your people and your 
father’s  house”  –  and  cleave  to  your  husband!  This  is  to  balance  what  
God says to husbands in Genesis 2:24. Then the King (your Bridegroom) 
will greatly desire your beauty. He is your Lord. Worship Him (verse 11).

296 Through the Bible: Trusting God and Worshipping Him
Psalms
Psalm 46 describes God as the refuge of His people. It is interesting to 
read this in the context of what Korah and his fellow-rebels experienced. 
Korah’s sons now sing that they will not be afraid even if the earth opens 
up  and  swallows  up  their  parents,  and  the  mountains  are  carried  into  
the depths. They will be at rest knowing that God is on the throne ruling 
over all (verse 10).
Psalm  47  is  a  song  of  praise  for  the  sovereignty  of  God.  Verse  4  is  a  
wonderful  verse:  “God  will  choose  my  inheritance  for  me.”  That  is  what  
a true disciple says: God will choose my wife for me. He will choose my 
ministry for me. He will choose the type of house I live in and everything 
else. I am not going to choose anything.
Psalm 48 speaks about the glory of Zion, a picture of the church. A true 
disciple of Jesus will not only appreciate the Lord Himself but also His 
Body, the church, the Lord’s people, as we see in verse 1: “Great is the 
Lord and greatly to be praised. Beautiful and the joy of the whole earth is 
Mount Zion.” The church is the most beautiful thing on earth. “This God 
is our God and He will be our guide unto death” (verse 14).
Psalm 49 describes the foolishness of trusting in earthly riches. “Many 
people trust in their wealth. But none of them can redeem their brother or 
give God a ransom for him. But God Himself will redeem my soul” (verses 
6, 7, 15).
Psalm  50  was  written  by  Asaph,  one  of  the  chief  singers  appointed  by  
David to lead God’s people in worship. It describes God as the Judge of 
all men – the righteous and the sinner. God calls to Himself “those who 
have made a covenant with Him by the sacrifice”  –  of  Calvary  (verse  5). 
God says, “If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine and 
everything  in  it”  (verse  12).  A  true  servant  of  God  says  the  same  thing  
too – he never makes his earthly needs known to anyone but God – Who 
owns the world. The apostle Paul is a great example in this matter. The 
Lord gives us a wonderful promise in verse 15: “Call upon Me in the day of 
trouble and I will deliver you”. In verses 19 and 20, God warns us against 
the sin of speaking evil of our brothers. Because He is patient with gossip-
ers, they may imagine that their sin is not serious. “I kept silence”, God 
says, “And you thought I was just like you” (verse 21). God threatens to 
tear such people in pieces (verse 22). Finally, a wonderful promise is found 
in verse 23, for those who instead of using their tongues to gossip, use 
them to praise the Lord: “Whoever offers praise glorifies Me, and thereby 
makes a way for Me to show him My deliverance” (Literal). When we praise 
the Lord, we thereby express our faith in Him as sovereign God and this 
expression of faith enables Him to show us His deliverance. We saw an 
example of that in what King Jehoshaphat did (2 Chronicles 20).
Psalm  51  is  the  prayer  of  a  repentant  sinner  asking  for  God’s  mercy. 
David wrote this psalm, after he was convicted of his sins of adultery and 

The Second Book – An Oppressed People Delivered                                                                          297
Psalms
murder. He did not write it immediately after committing those sins. He 
wrote this only after Nathan the prophet came and spoke to him, nine 
months later, when Bathsheba bore his child. It is amazing that David 
took  so  long  to  be  convicted  of  such  serious  sins.  This  is,  however,  a  
beautiful psalm of repentance and shows us why God restored David so 
quickly. The first thing to note is that he does not make any excuses for 
his sin, like Adam did (verses 3, 4). He proclaims his faith that if the Lord 
cleanses away his sin, he will be “whiter than snow” (verse 7). He asks 
the Lord to give him a new heart that will not commit such sins: “Create 
in me a clean heart.” (verse 10). He pleads with God not to take the Holy 
Spirit away (verse 11). David knew the value of being anointed, and how 
sin  could  make  him  lose  the  anointing.  That  was  what  he  feared  the  
most. A broken and contrite heart is what God values highly (verse 17). 
David realised that God desired “truth in the innermost being” (verse 6). 
But this was not possible under the Law. But what the Law could not do, 
God has now done by sending His Holy Spirit to dwell inside us (Romans 
8:3, 4; John 7:37–39).
Psalm 52 contrasts the end of the wicked man with that of the godly man.
Psalm  53  is  almost  a  word-for-word  repetition  of  Psalm  14,  about  the  
wickedness of man.
Psalm 54 is a prayer for help, deliverance and vindication.
Psalm  55  is  again  a  prayer  for  protection  from  the  enemy.  This  enemy  
had  once  been  a  close  friend  –  like  Judas  (verses  12–14).  We  read  in  
verse 17 about how often David prayed: “Evening and morning and noon 
God will hear my voice.” The Jewish day began at sunset and lasted until 
sunset  the  next  day.  So  “evening  and  morning  and  noon”  refers  to  the  
beginning of the day, the middle of the day and the end of the day. David 
was a man of prayer. Verse 22 is one of the most beautiful promises in 
the Old Testament: “Cast your burden upon the Lord and He will sustain 
you. He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.”
Psalm 56 is yet another psalm of trust in God that delivers us from the 
fear of men who try to harm us (verses 3, 11). Verse 11: “In God I have put 
my trust. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?” is repeated almost 
exactly in Psalm 118:6 and quoted in Hebrews 13:6.
Psalm  57 is another confident prayer to God for help from the enemy. 
The psalmist says he will stay “in the shadow of the Lord’s wings” for that 
will protect him from the calamities surrounding him (verse 1). “Be Thou 
exalted, O God, above the heavens,” is repeated in verses 5 and 11. 
Psalm 58 speaks about the punishment of the wicked. Verse 3 tells us 
that human beings begin to tell lies right from the time they are born. 
That is the first sin we all commit. A baby begins to lie even before it 
can speak. For example, it cries, pretending that it is in pain, when all 

298 Through the Bible: Trusting God and Worshipping Him
Psalms
it  wants  is  to  be  just  picked  up  and  carried.  We must earnestly fight 
against this habit if we are to get rid of lying before we leave the earth.
Psalm 59 is a confident prayer for God’s help against the enemies.
Psalm  60  bemoans  the  fact  that  God  is  not  supporting  His  people  and  
asks  Him  for  help  to  overcome  the  enemy.  “Thou  hast  given  a  banner  
to  those  who  fear  Thee  that  it  may  be  displayed  because  of  the  truth” 
(verse 4). God has given us the name of Jesus as a banner. We are not 
ashamed to display it wherever we go.
Psalm 61 is a confession of David’s faith that God will protect him and 
prolong his life. His prayer is “Lead me to the rock that is higher than I” 
(verse 2). That Rock is Christ.
Psalm 62 also expresses confidence in God as a refuge that can be trusted. 
“My soul, wait in silence for God only, for my hope is from Him” (verse 5). 
Many  are  disappointed  because  their  expectation  is  from  man.  Those  
who trust in God will never be disappointed.
Psalm 63 expresses David’s total satisfaction with God, even though he 
was in the wilderness at that time. He says, “Thy lovingkindness is better 
than life” (verse 3).
Psalm  64 again expresses the confidence that David has that God will 
destroy his enemies.
Psalm 65 praises God for His goodness. Verse 1 (KJV) says, “Lord, praise 
is  waiting  for  you  in  Zion  (the  church).” Our  churches  should  be  places  
where praise is always waiting for God. When God comes into our midst, 
He must find praise waiting for Him. God draws such people close to Him. 
Verse 4 says, “How blessed is the one whom Thou dost choose and bring 
near to Thee.” The psalm goes on to speak of the goodness of God to the 
earth.
Psalm 66: The psalmist praises God here for bringing him into a place 
of blessedness. But this was through many trials. In verses 10 to 12, we 
read  that  God took the psalmist through sickness, fire and water and 
human oppression before bringing him to a place of spiritual prosperity. 
The Hebrew word translated “place of abundance” here, is used in only 
one  other  place  in  Scripture  –  in  Psalm  23:6,  where  it  is  translated  as  
“overflows”. So the way to have an overflowing life of blessing is through 
trial and suffering. Verse 18 is another important verse: “If I regard sin in 
my heart, the Lord will not hear me.” Prayer is like having a phone conver-
sation with God. But if we have unconfessed sin in our hearts, then God 
will not even pick up the phone to listen to our prayers.
Psalm 67 exhorts all the people on earth to praise God. This is an evan-
gelistic psalm where the psalmist longs that God’s way and His salvation 
will be known all over the world (verse 2). 

The Third Book – The Temple and God’s Throne                                                                                 299
Psalms
Psalm 68 is a song of praise to God for His wonders. Verse 6 is a promise 
for bachelors and spinsters: “God make a home for the lonely.” Verse 11 is 
about evangelism: “The Lord gives the command; the women who proclaim 
the  good  tidings  are  a  great  host.”  God  expects  women  to  preach  the  
gospel!! Verse 18 “Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captive Thy 
captives; Thou hast received gifts among men” is quoted in Ephesians 4:8 
and is a prophetic reference to Jesus’ ascension and to the spiritual gifts 
He gave to the church from heaven.
Psalm 69 is David’s cry of distress, asking God to help him against those 
who were persecuting him. A number of verses here are prophetic about 
the Messiah: “What I did not steal I have to restore” (verse 4) is a refer-
ence to Jesus paying for our sins on the cross. “Reproach has broken My 
heart” (verse 20) refers to the fact that Jesus died of a physically broken 
heart. Blood and water poured out when Jesus’ side was pierced. Doctors 
have said that that could happen only if his heart was physically broken. 
Verse 29 is a prophetic reference to the resurrection and ascension.
Psalm 70 is another cry for help against the enemy.
Psalm 71 is a prayer for deliverance by the psalmist in his old age. His 
days  are  still  spent  in  praising  the  Lord (verse  8).  And  although  he  is  
now old and gray-headed, he longs to proclaim God’s power to the new 
generation (verses 17, 18). He proclaims his faith in the resurrection in 
verse 20: “You will bring me up again from the depths of the earth.”
Psalm 72 is a psalm that David wrote for Solomon his son, as the first 
verse makes clear. In it, he describes how a king should be and what he 
should do. Unfortunately, Solomon did not become the type of king as 
described here. That is a warning for us. It is possible for us too, to study 
all these wonderful things in these psalms and practice none of them!
The Third Book – The Temple and God’s Throne
Psalms 73 to 83 were written by Asaph, one of David’s singers (who wrote 
Psalm 50 too). 
Psalm 73 deals with a question that many people have asked through the 
centuries: “Why do the wicked prosper, and why do the righteous suffer?” 
Asaph  says  quite  honestly  that  he  almost  slipped  into  doubting  God,  
when he saw the prosperity of the wicked (verses 2, 3). This led him to 
wonder whether it was worth living a holy life. But he never shared these 
thoughts with others, lest he cause them to stumble. He finally found 
the answer when he went into God’s presence and saw that the wicked 
stand on very slippery ground and are soon in hell. Verse 25 is perhaps 
the finest verse in the whole Bible that describes what true consecra-
tion  really  means:  “Whom  have  I  in  heaven  but  Thee.  There  is  no  
one and nothing on earth I desire beside Thee.” If we can say that

Psalms
in all sincerity all through our earthly lives, we will be true worshippers 
and useful servants of God. Verse 26: “My heart may fail, but God is the 
strength of my heart” is a good verse for those who have heart-problems! 
Psalm 74 is a cry of concern about the ruined condition of God’s people. 
This  could  be  applied  to  the  church:  “Lord,  Your  enemies  have  ruined  
things  in  Your  church  and  are  roaring  inside  it  now.  They  have  made  it  
impure” (verses 3, 4, 7). Two marks are mentioned here of God not being 
in the midst of His people:
1. He does not do any miracles for them.
2. He does not send them any prophets (verse 9).
God  is  a  God  who  answers  our  prayers  in  miraculous  ways.  He  is  
also One Who sends us prophets to correct us. If God is not answering 
prayers in a church or does not send prophets to that church, that would 
be an indication that He has given up on that church. We can expect to 
find both miracles and prophets in a Spirit-filled church.
Psalm 75: The theme here is that God humbles the proud but exalts the 
humble. We must not expect to be promoted by man (verse 6). Promotion 
comes from God (verse 7). Don’t imagine that a man can give you a minis-
try in the church. Only God can do that for you.
Psalm  76  describes  the  mighty  sovereign  power  of  God  that  can  make  
even the angry actions of men to fulfil His purposes, resulting in praise 
to Him (verse 10).
Psalm 77 is a recollection of what God did “in the days of old”. When Asaph 
was  in  trouble,  he found  comfort  in  thinking  of  that  (verse  5). Verse  13 
(KJV) says, “Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary.” To find out God’s ways, 
we have to go into the sanctuary – the most holy place. We can’t find them in 
the “outer court”. Most believers know only the forgiveness of their sins. If 
you fellowship only with such believers who have no hunger after God, you 
will not know God’s ways, for His way is in the sanctuary. So seek fellow-
ship with “those who call on the Lord with a pure heart” (2 Timothy 2:22).
Psalm  78  is  a  historical  psalm  that  looks  back  at  the  way  God  led  the  
Israelites from the time of their deliverance from Egypt. But they ignored 
God  and  sought  Him  only  when  He  slew  them  (verse  34). They flattered 
Him with their mouths and told Him lies (verse 36). But God being compas-
sionate,  forgave  them  repeatedly (verse  38).  He  gave  them  a  shepherd,  
David, who shepherded them and guided them (verses 70, 72). This psalm 
reminds us to look back and remember the wonderful things God has done 
for us and the leaders He gave us, so that we are grateful to Him always.
Psalm 79 is a prayer of concern for the ruin of Jerusalem (the church). 
This is a good prayer for us to pray who are concerned for the purity of 
the church.

The Third Book – The Temple and God’s Throne                                                                                 301
Psalms
Psalm 80 is a prayer asking God to save His people from their problems. 
Verse 17 is Messianic: “Let Your hand be upon the Man of Your right hand, 
upon the Son of man whom You have made strong for Yourself.”
Psalm  81  proclaims  God’s  goodness  and  Israel’s  disobediences.  Verse 
10 has a lovely promise: “Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.” Very 
often, we do not have because we do not ask. The Lord says with a sigh 
in verses 13 & 14, “O that My people would listen to Me! I would quickly 
subdue their enemies.” God would have solved our problems and deliv-
ered us long ago, if only we had listened to Him and trusted Him!
Psalm 82 is a psalm that rebukes the unjust judges of Israel and urges 
God to come down and judge the earth.
Psalm  83  asks  God  to  judge  the  enemies  who  seek  to  destroy  Israel,  
saying,  “Let  us  wipe  them  out  as  a  nation”  (verse  4).  Many  nations  
have tried to destroy Israel through the centuries. But they have never 
succeeded. People have tried to wipe out the church also. They too have 
never succeeded. The church continues to survive so that all men may 
know that Jesus Christ is Lord over all the earth (verse 18).
Psalm  84  expresses  a  longing  to  worship  God  in  His  temple.  As  the  
swallow  has  found  a  place  to  make  a  nest  –  on  God’s  altar  (verse  3) – 
even so, those who live in the Most Holy Place too are blessed and will be 
praising God always (verse 4). When they pass through the valley of Baca 
(weeping), they will turn it into a spring of blessing (verse 6) and move 
from strength to strength (verse 7). Verse 10 becomes meaningful, when 
we realise that this psalm was written by the sons of Korah: “A day in Your 
courts (standing with Moses) is better than a thousand outside. I would 
rather stand at the threshold of God’s house (with Moses) than dwell in 
the tents of wickedness (with our father Korah).” They were grateful for 
having been delivered from the tents of wickedness. “No good thing does 
God withhold from those who walk uprightly” (verse 11). We will get the 
very best from God if we walk in uprightness.
Psalm 85 is a prayer for God to visit His people. “Wilt Thou not Thyself 
revive us again, that Thy people may rejoice in Thee” (verse 6). There is a 
lot of grumbling and complaining among God’s people. What is desper-
ately needed is a revival of joy and praise. “I will hear what the Lord is 
saying. The Lord will speak ‘peace’ to His godly ones” (verse 8). What did 
the Lord say? That “mercy and truth are met together” and that “righteous-
ness and peace have kissed each other” (verse 10). The demands of God’s 
truth (law) and His mercy met at Calvary. Peace was established between 
God and men in a righteous way – on Calvary.
Psalm 86 is another prayer for help and guidance. “Teach me Thy way, 
O  Lord,  and  I  will  walk  in  Thy  truth.  Unite  my  heart  to  fear  Your  name” 
(verse 11). David’s prayer is that his heart (that is being pulled in differ-
ent directions) will be united to fear God.

302 Through the Bible: Trusting God and Worshipping Him
Psalms
Psalm  87  is  about  the  privilege  of  being  a  citizen  of  Zion  (the  church).  
“It will be said of Zion, ‘This one and that one were born in her’ ” (verse 5). 
“All my springs of joy are in you” (verse 7). This speaks of the great joy 
that a child of God finds in being a part of the church.
Psalm  88  is  a  plea  for  deliverance  from  death.  This  is  perhaps  the  
most  depressing  of  all  the  psalms.  The  psalmist  (probably  Heman  the  
Ezrahite) complains that he has been afflicted from the time he was 
young (verse 15) and that God had rejected him. He now fears that he 
is going to die and is filled with gloom at the prospect. He sounds very 
much  like  Job.  Unlike  other  psalms  about  suffering  which  end with  a  
word of hope, this one ends in despair. 
Psalm 89 is a psalm about God’s faithfulness to his covenant with David, 
and asks God to fulfil His promises. Its tone is the very opposite of the 
previous  psalm.  This  psalm  was  written  by  another  Ezrahite  –  Ethan.  
But he has exactly the opposite outlook of his brother, Heman, who wrote 
Psalm 88. Verse 7 says, “God must be greatly reverenced in the council of 
the holy ones (church).” Verses 27 to 29 refer to Jesus: “I will make my 
first-born the highest of the kings of the earth.” 
The Fourth Book – Israel and Other Nations
Psalm  90  deals  with  the  eternity  of  God  and  the  temporary  nature  of  
man. It is the only psalm written by Moses. We read here that “a thou-
sand years are like one day” for God (verse 4). In verse 10, Moses refers 
to the men around him dying between the ages of 70 and 80. This was 
because most of the 600,000 men who left Egypt were between 20 and 
60 years of age when they left. Although a few of them like Moses, lived 
up to the age of 120, most of them died before they reached the age of 80, 
because  God  had  determined  that  that  entire  generation  should  die  in  
the wilderness. And so in verse 12, Moses prays, “Teach us to number our 
days to know how few they are, so that we can spend our days acquiring 
wisdom” – a very good prayer for all of us to pray. Verse 17 is another 
good prayer for all of us to pray: “Let the beauty of the Lord be upon us.”
Psalm 91 proclaims the blessedness and security of the one who lives in 
“the secret place of the Most High”. For us, that secret place is the wounded 
side of Jesus. Living in “the shadow of the Almighty” implies that God is 
going  in  front  of  us,  and  we  are  walking  in  His  shadow  (verse  1). The 
safest place in the whole world is the centre of God’s perfect will. The Lord 
promises to deliver us from both our enemies – Satan (the trapper) and 
sin (deadly disease) (verse 3). He will save us from obvious sins (daytime 
dangers)  and  from  subtle,  deceptive  sins  (night-time  dangers)  (verses 
5, 6). Even if 11,000 Christians around us do not believe in a victorious 
life, He will keep us from falling into sin (verse 7). We may have to face 
many afflictions, but in them all, no evil will  ever  befall  us  (verse  10). 

The Fourth Book – Israel and Other Nations                                                                                       303
Psalms
He has appointed angels to care for us, as long as we walk in His will. 
Satan (the lion and the serpent) will always be crushed under our feet 
(verse 13). God will answer our prayers and set us on high and give us 
length of life so that we do not die until we have finished our appointed 
task (verses 15, 16). 
Psalm 92 praises the Lord for His goodness to him. “They will still yield fruit 
in old age; they shall be full of sap and very green” (verse 14). That means 
they will be full of the Holy Spirit’s anointing even when they are old.
Psalm 93 speaks of the might and majesty of the Lord. “Holiness befits 
Your house, O Lord” (verse 5).
Psalm 94 speaks of God Who chastens His people but destroys the wicked. 
“Blessed is the man whom Thou dost chasten, O Lord” (verse 12). 
Psalm  95  invites  us  to  worship  the  Lord  and  warns  us  against  being  
hardened. Verses  7  and  8  –  “Today  if  you  would  hear  His  voice,  do  not  
harden your hearts” – are quoted in Hebrews 3:7, 8. Hebrews goes on to 
say that we need to be exhorted and encouraged every day if we are to 
avoid being hardened (Hebrews 3:13).
Psalm  96  is  yet  another  invitation  to  worship  the  Lord  Who  is  coming  
soon. “The Lord is coming to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with 
righteousness and the people with His truth” (verse 13). 
Psalm 97 describes the power of God. Verse 10 says, “You who love the 
Lord,  hate  evil.”  We  cannot  say  we  love  the  Lord  if  we  don’t  hate  evil.  
There is a lot of difference between avoiding evil and hating evil. The way 
to overcome sin is to hate it. Hate is equal to murder. When we hate sin 
we will kill it.
Psalm 98 invites us to sing praises to the Lord.
Psalm 99 is another call to praise the Lord.
Psalm 100 is yet another invitation to praise the Lord and to serve Him. 
We are to “serve the Lord with gladness” (verse 2). I have met people who 
say they are serving the Lord, but who are complaining about something 
or the other most of the time. God doesn’t want anyone to serve Him who 
doesn’t serve Him joyfully.
Psalm 101: Here David speaks about the blameless way in which he has 
sought to live. “I will give heed to the blameless way. I will walk within my 
house in the integrity of my heart” (verse 2). Every one of us must be able 
to say that. It is in our home that we must walk blamelessly first of all. 
To be blameless does not mean that we never fail. It means that when we 
fail, we apologise and set the matter right. We must be blameless in our 
financial dealings too.

Psalms
Psalm 102 is the prayer of a suffering man for help. He concludes express-
ing his faith that God will answer and that His children and grandchildren 
too will follow the Lord (verse 28). 
Psalm  103  speaks  of  the  numerous  blessings  David  had  received  from  
the Lord – all his sins forgiven, all his diseases healed, salvation from the 
pit (of hell), and material blessings (“good things”). David received all this 
under  the  old  covenant.  If  all  that  we  preach  is  that  Jesus  can  forgive  
us, heal us, bless us materially and save us from hell, then we are only 
preaching what David preached 1000 years before Christ. What then is 
the new covenant gospel? It is this: Jesus can give you victory over sin 
(Romans 6:14). He can make you partake of God’s nature (2 Peter 1:3, 4). 
He can enable you to have the devil under your feet (Romans 16:20). He 
can enable you to build the church as the body of Christ (Ephesians 4).
Psalm 104 describes God’s wonderful works in creation. “God makes His 
servants a flaming fire” (verse 4). All servants of the Lord must be flaming 
fires for the Lord. When Moses saw a flaming fire in a bush he stopped to 
listen. When we are like that, baptised in the Holy Spirit and fire, people 
will stop to listen to us too.
Psalm 105 describes the wonderful things that God did for Israel. Verse 
15 says,  “Don’t  touch  My  anointed  and  don’t  do  any  harm  to  My  proph-
ets.” God defends His anointed prophets and warns us against speaking 
against them. It says about Joseph: “He was sold for a servant until the 
time came. The word of the Lord tested him and iron entered into his soul” 
(verses 17 - margin, 18, 19). God allowed Joseph to be put into prison, 
so  that  he  might  become  as  strong  as  iron  –  so  that  “iron  might  enter  
his  soul”.  There  was  an  appointed  time  for  Joseph  to  be  released.  God  
is always on time. Verse 39 tells us why God gave the Israelites a pillar 
of cloud and fire. The cloud was to cover them from the heat of the sun 
during the day, and the fire was to give them light at night. 
Psalm  106  continues  with  the  history  of  God’s  goodness  to  Israel.  In  
verses 11, 12 we read, “When the waters covered their enemies then they 
believed  His  words  and  sang  His  praise.”  There  are  two  things  we  see  
there. Firstly, the evidence of faith is praise. Out of the abundance of the 
heart, the mouth speaks. The mouth is the overflow valve of the heart. If 
we have faith in our hearts, it overflows in praise. When the apostles were 
filled with the Holy Spirit, they began to praise God (Acts 2). If we don’t 
praise God, it proves that we don’t have faith. Secondly, under the old 
covenant, they lived by sight and not by faith. They could praise God only 
after they saw their enemies drowned. Today, we can praise God, even 
before our enemies are defeated. That is to walk by faith and not by sight.

Psalms
The Fifth Book – Praise and Worship
Psalm  107  describes  the  many  ways  in  which  the  Lord  delivers  people  
out of difficult situations. Those who were wandering in the wilderness 
were led to a city (verses 4–7). Those who sat in darkness were brought 
out of it (verses 10, 14). Those who were sick were healed. “He sent His 
word and healed them” (verse 20). Those who were caught in a stormy 
sea were rescued (verses 25–29). And so it says in verse 2, “Let those who 
are redeemed by the Lord say so.” We must not be silent when the Lord 
has done something for us, and especially if He has redeemed us from 
the hand of the enemy. We must testify about it for the glory of God.
Psalm  108  expresses  confidence  that  God  will  lead  the  psalmist  into 
victory.  He  says,  “My  heart  is  steadfast,  O  God,  I  will  sing,  I  will  sing  
praises.  I  will  awaken  the  dawn”  (verses  1,  2). He  was  determined  to  
wake up before dawn every day and praise the Lord first of all – a good 
habit for all of us to follow.
Psalm  109:  Here  David  asks  God  to  wreak  vengeance  on  his  enemies.  
Verse  8  is  quoted  by  Peter  in  Acts  1  referring  to  Judas  Iscariot:  “Let 
another take his office”.  Judas  was  called  by  God,  but  he  listened  to  
Satan who stood at his right hand (verse 6). Instead of having God at his 
right hand, he chose Satan. It is most likely that the ministry that God 
had planned for Judas was given to the apostle Paul. If we are unfaithful, 
another can take our ministry.
Psalm 110 is a Messianic psalm that refers to Jesus as King and Priest 
according to the order of Melchizedek (verse 4). This is quoted in Hebrews7.
Psalm 111 is another psalm praising God for His goodness. The earlier 
psalms were generally cries for help. But as we come to the end of the 
Psalms, we find that there are many more psalms of praise. That’s how 
our lives should be too. Our Christian life usually begins with cries for 
help. As we grow older, our lives should be filled with praise more and 
more. Verse 10: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom”, occurs 
here before it occurs in Proverbs. We don’t know who wrote this psalm. 
But if it was written by David, then he spoke these words first, before his 
son Solomon repeated them in Proverbs.
Psalm 112 is a beautiful psalm and one my favourite psalms. It describes 
the  blessedness  of  one  who  fears  the  Lord.  Such  a  man’s  children  will  
be blessed and he will prosper. He will get light from God when he is in 
darkness. He is righteous and compassionate and lends to those in need. 
He  will  not  be  afraid  of  bad  news  because  his  heart  trusts  in  the  Lord  
steadfastly. God will honour him and the wicked will be envious of him. 
“God’s constant care of him will make a deep impression on all who see 
it” (verse 6 - Living). That’s how it should be in our lives. People around 
us should be deeply impressed when they see how God has blessed us.

306 Through the Bible: Trusting God and Worshipping Him
Psalms
Psalm 113 praises the Lord Who exalts the poor and needy. God is so great 
that it is because of His humility that He even looks at what happens in 
heaven and on earth (verses 5, 6).
Psalm  114  speaks  about  Israel’s  coming  out  of  Egypt  and  entering  
Canaan.
Psalm 115 contrasts God with idols. “Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to Thy 
Name give glory” (verse 1). “The dead do not praise the Lord” (verse 17). 
So we should praise the Lord as long as we are alive.
Psalm 116: Here the psalmist thanks the Lord for saving him from death. 
“What shall I render to the Lord for all the wonderful things He has done 
for me?” (verse 12). That is a good question that we should always ask 
ourselves.
Psalm 117 is the shortest chapter in the Bible – two verses of praise.
Psalm 118 is a psalm of thanksgiving for deliverance. “It is better to take 
refuge in the Name of the Lord than to trust in man” (verse 8). Three times 
we are told that in the name of Jesus we can overcome Satan and his 
demons  (verses  10,  11,  12).  “The  stone  which  the  builders  rejected  has  
become  the  chief  cornerstone”  (verse  22).  The  Pharisees  rejected  Jesus.  
But He is the chief cornerstone of the church today. People may reject us 
too. But God will exalt us. “O Lord, do save (Hosanna)” (verse 25) was the 
cry with which they waved palms when Jesus came to Jerusalem a few 
days before His crucifixion.
Psalm  119: This  describes  the  blessedness  of  the  Law  of  God.  It  is  the  
longest  chapter  in  the  Bible  and  each  of  its  176  verses  refers  in  some  
way to God’s Word. It is an alphabetical psalm. The first eight verses of 
the psalm begin with the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet – ‘Aleph’. The 
next eight verses begin with the second letter – ‘Beth’. And so on, through 
the  twenty-two  letters  of  the  alphabet.  Verse  9  says  that  a  young  man  
can keep his way pure by obeying God’s Word. Verse 11 says that we can 
avoid sin by keeping God’s Word in our heart. Verse 18 is a prayer: “Open 
my eyes that I may behold wonderful things from Thy law.” Verse 67 says 
that it was through many afflictions that the psalmist learnt to obey God. 
“Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path” (verse 105). “The 
unfolding of Thy Word gives light” (verse 130). Verse 133 anticipates the 
new covenant promise of Romans 6:14 and says, “Lord, don’t let sin have 
dominion over me.” “Those who love Thy law have great peace” (verse 165). 
And finally, verse 176: “I have gone astray, Lord. Seek Thy servant.”
Psalms 120 to 134 are a group of 15 psalms called “Psalms of ascents”. 
This may be because they were sung as the Israelites went to the festivals 
in Jerusalem. Or it could be songs of musical ascent.

Psalms
Psalm  120  is  a  cry  for  protection  from  false  accusers.  We  could  apply  
verses  2  to  4  to  taking  a  radical  attitude  towards  controlling  our  own  
tongue:  “Deliver  me,  O  Lord,  from  lying  lips  and  a  deceitful  tongue.  
What shall I give you, O false tongue? I’ll shoot you with arrows and burn 
you up” (verses 2–4).
Psalm 121 celebrates the Lord as our Keeper. “Where will my help come 
from? Will it come from the Egyptians beyond those southern mountains 
or from the Assyrians beyond the northern mountains? No. My help comes 
from  the  Lord  who  made  heaven  and  earth.  He  is  the  One  who  never  
sleeps. He will take care of me. Day-time or night-time, nothing will smite 
me” (verse 4).
Psalm  122  is  a  prayer  for  the  peace  of  Jerusalem  (the  church).  “I  was  
glad when they said unto me, ‘Let us go to the church-meeting. My home is 
in the church, in the midst of God’s people.’ ” A true disciple of Jesus will 
value the fellowship of God’s people.
Psalm 123 is another prayer for protection from the arrogant. “Lord, my 
eyes  are  looking  up  to  You  just  like  the  eyes  of  a  servant  looks  to  his  
master” (verse 2). Our calling is to wait on the Lord like that and not to 
run around doing “something for the Lord”, according to our own ideas. 
Psalm 124 praises the Lord for saving His people from their enemies.
Psalm  125  speaks  of  the  solid  security  of  God’s  people.  “Those  who  
trust in the Lord will be like a mountain that cannot be shaken. The Lord 
surrounds His people” (verses 1, 2).
Psalm 126 celebrates the return from the captivity in Babylon. They had 
sowed in tears in Babylon and now reap in joy in Jerusalem. To build the 
church, we need to sow in tears even today.
Psalm 127 is a psalm about building the home. Amazingly, this psalm was 
written by Solomon, who had 700 wives and 300 concubines and never 
built a home himself (1 Kings 11:3)!! That shows how easy it is to preach 
powerful, accurate sermons and never practise what one preaches. The 
psalm  says,  “Unless  the  Lord  builds  the  house,  they  labour  in  vain  who  
build it. Children are a heritage of the Lord” (verses 1, 3). It goes on to say 
that our children must grow up in such a way that our enemies’ mouths 
are shut when they see the way we have brought up our children. But the 
man who wrote that psalm is in hell today!
Psalm 128 is another psalm about the blessed home life of a man who 
fears the Lord!
Psalm 129 is another Messianic psalm. The psalmist prays that all who 
hate Zion (the church) be put to shame.

308 Through the Bible: Trusting God and Worshipping Him
Psalms
Psalm  130  expresses  an  eager  longing  after  the  Lord.  “There  is  forgive-
ness with the Lord that He may be feared” (verse 4). God forgives us so 
that we fear Him and don’t sin again.
Psalm  131  expresses  a  simple  childlike  trust  in  the  Lord.  Verse  1  is  a  
good example for us to follow – not to involve ourselves in matters that 
we have no experience in and that are outside our ability to understand. 
There are many things which are outside our boundary which are best 
left in God’s hands.
Psalm  132  speaks  of  David’s  great  passion  to  build  a  house  for  God  
(verses 4, 5). But he was not given that privilege. We must have a similar 
passion to build the church.
Psalm 133 has unity as its subject. “How good it is for brothers to dwell 
together in unity” (verse 1). Unity is a fundamental requirement for build-
ing  Zion  (the  church),  because  the  anointing  and  the  blessing  of  God  
flows in its fullness only where there is such unity (verses 2, 3). The Holy 
Spirit fell upon that first group of 120 men and women because they were 
“of one mind” (Acts 1:14).
Psalm 134: This is the last of the psalms of ascent and invites people to 
praise the Lord.
Psalm  135  contrasts  the  greatness  of  the  Lord  with  the  impotence  of  
idols. “Those who make idols will be like them” (verse 18). We become like 
the God we worship. If the God we worship is “a policeman” who is always 
seeking  to  catch  people  doing  something  wrong,  then  we  will  become  
policemen towards others too. But if we worship a loving Heavenly Father 
who is merciful and compassionate, then we will be like Him to others too.
Psalm 136 is a psalm that gives thanks to the Lord for His loving- kindness 
to Israel through the years.
Psalm  137  is  a  psalm  about  the  experience  of  the  Israelites  when  they  
were  captives  in  Babylon.  There  they  learnt  to  value  Jerusalem  above  
everything  else.  We  too  need  to  value  the  church  more  than  anything  
else on earth. The hatred expressed for Babylon in verses 7 to 9 should 
be the hatred we have for a religious system built in Christendom by the 
traditions of men that dishonours God – a hatred, not for the people in the 
system, but for the system itself.
Psalm 138 is a prayer of thanksgiving and faith in the Lord. “Thou hast 
magnified Thy word according to all Thy name” (verse 2). God’s Word is 
as  exalted  as  His  Name.  To  dishonour  His  Word  by  disobeying  it  is  as  
serious  as  dishonouring  the  Name  of  Jesus!  David  has  faith  that  “the 
Lord will accomplish what concerns me” (verse 8).
Psalm  139  describes  the  fact  that  God  is  everywhere  and  knows  all  
things. We are in God’s presence everywhere we go (verses 7–12). That is 

The Fifth Book – Praise and Worship                                                                                                     309
Psalms
what makes our life so secure. His foreknowledge has also planned every 
day of our earthly lives right from the day we were born and written it 
down in a book (verse 16). God will show us that plan one page at a time. 
If   we live in that plan, we will have no regret when we come to the end of 
our earthly lives. Verse 24 (Living) is a good prayer that we should pray 
frequently: “Lord, point out anything you find in me that makes You sad.”
Psalm  140  is  another  prayer  for  protection  from  evil  men.  The  upright  
alone will dwell in God’s presence (verse 13).
Psalm 141 is a cry for the Lord’s help to be holy in speech and in heart 
and also for protection. “Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth. Do not let my 
heart incline towards any evil thing” (verses 3, 4).
Psalm 142 is another cry for help. 
Psalm  143  is  a  prayer  for  guidance  and  deliverance.  “Teach  me  to  do  
Thy will. Let Thy good Spirit lead me on to level ground” (verse 10). Level 
ground is one where we progress steadily and don’t have up-and-down 
experiences.
Psalm 144 is a prayer for deliverance and for blessing on David’s children. 
He wants his sons to grow up like strong solid trees and his daughters to 
be as strong as the pillars of a palace (verse 12).
Psalm 145 is a psalm of praise to the Lord for His greatness. “The Lord 
is near to all who call upon Him. He will fulfil the desire of those who fear 
Him” (verses 18, 19).
Psalm 146: The last five psalms are psalms of praise. This one praises the 
Lord for His creative power and His goodness and urges us not to trust in 
any mortal man, not even in princes (verse 3).
Psalm 147 also praises the Lord for His works in creation. He also heals 
the  broken-hearted  (verse  3).  “He  builds  the  church.”  He  does  many  
wonderful things.
Psalm 148: Here all of creation is urged to praise the Lord.
Psalm 149 invites us to praise the Lord at all times. “He will beautify the 
humble with salvation” (verse 4). If you want the Lord to beautify you, you 
must be humble. We are called to sing for joy even on our beds and to 
have the high praises of God always in our mouth and the word of God 
in our hands to bind the power and activities of Satan and his demons 
(verses 5–8). Praise to God and binding Satan’s power always go together.
Psalm  150: This is the grand finale. Thirteen times we read the word 
“praise”  in  this  psalm,  concluding  with  “Let  everything  that  has  breath  
praise the Lord” (verse 6). There is only one type of person who does not 
have to praise God – the one who cannot breathe, the dead. All the rest 
must keep praising the Lord at all times. May it be so in our lives. Amen.

PROVERBS
Words of Wisdom
T
he  books  of  Psalms and Proverbs describe  two  aspects  of  our  
Christian  life.  Psalms speaks  of  our  trust  in  God  and  worship  of  
Him. Proverbs deals with the other half of the circle of our life – our 
daily walk in this world and our relationship with other human beings. 
These two must always go together. We must not be so heavenly minded 
that we are of no earthly use. Neither must we be so earthly minded that 
we are of no use to God. A devotional life with God, a walk with God, a 
life of praise and worship and prayer and faith must lead to a practical 
life that manifests the character and the nature of Christ towards others 
here on this earth. The book of Proverbs deals primarily with that. There 
is  instruction  here  for  young  people,  for  our  working  life,  and  for  our  
home situations.
Proverbs deals with the subjects of wise and foolish children, laziness 
and hard work, the use of the tongue, wealth and poverty, telling lies and 
speaking  the  truth,  being  talkative  and  being  subdued  in  our  speech,  
slandering,  justice  and  injustice,  pride  and  humility,  good  women  and  
bad  women,  covetousness  and  contentment,  anger  and  self  control,  
gloominess  and  cheerfulness,  good  company  and  bad  company,  the  
education  and  discipline  of  children,  the  fear  of  the  Lord,  the  opinion  
that people have about themselves, warnings against temptations, how 
to treat servants, bribery, reproof, correction, friendships, sensual pleas-
ures,  drunkenness,  flattery,  money  not  acquired  in  righteous  ways, 
revenge etc. You can see that covers many areas of our daily life on earth. 
That is why it is good for all young people to study this book seriously.
The Beginning of Wisdom 
The first nine chapters are directed primarily to young people: “To know 
wisdom and instruction, to discern the sayings of understanding” (1:2). 
These three words have a distinctive meaning in the book of Proverbs.

312 Through the Bible: Words of Wisdom
Proverbs
• Wisdom refers to the Divine nature.
• Instruction refers to practical knowledge that comes through  discipline. 
• Understanding refers to the knowledge of God and His ways.
The very first thing the writer has to say is this: “The fear of the Lord is 
the beginning of knowledge” (1:7). There are two types of fear that we can 
have of God – one is wrong and the other is right. The wrong type of fear 
is  the  fear  that  God  may  hurt  us.  The  right  type  of  fear  is  the  fear  that 
we may hurt God. False religions major on the first type of fear. They 
teach  people  that  God  is  angry  with  them  and  may  hurt  them.  So  the  
people seek to appease their god and to make him happy by offering him 
gifts and sacrifices and by going on pilgrimages. That spirit is found in 
Babylonian Christianity too. But the type of fear the Bible speaks about 
is the fear that we may hurt God by the way we live. The Holy Spirit can 
be grieved by something we do or say or think. Such a fear is actually a 
reverence for God. 
True wisdom is to have a reverence for God. Many people crack jokes 
about God and about spiritual things. Humour is a gift of God. But we 
must never make God and Divine things the subject of a joke. We must 
never make hell the subject of jokes – because hell is an awful reality. 
A person who reverences God will never joke about hell – just like we 
would not joke about a man dying of AIDS.
Reverence for God is terribly lacking in the world today. If we want to 
become spiritual, we must begin with reverence for God. The knowledge 
that Proverbs speaks about is the knowledge of God – not an academic 
knowledge of the Bible. There is a vast difference between knowing the 
Bible  and  knowing  God. Wisdom  comes  from  reverence  for  God  and  
knowing Him. The more we know Him, the more we reverence Him; and 
the more we reverence Him, we get to know Him even more.
Every verse in Proverbs is of value. This is the best book of practical 
advice in the Old Testament. It is like a New Testament book in the Old 
Testament! But we won’t be looking at each verse here. We will be looking 
only at some of the most important verses.

He  goes  on  to  warn  young  people  to  be  careful  about  the  type  of  
company they keep. “If sinners entice you, don’t listen to them. Don’t allow 
other  people  to  drag  you  in  their  worldly  ways”  (verse  10).  Stand  alone  
if necessary, for the Lord. One of the most important things that young 
people  need  to  learn  is  to  say,  “No.  I  can’t  come  along  with  you.”  That  
may offend many of your friends. But you won’t regret it in the long run.
To all such young men, God gives a promise: “I will pour out My Spirit 
on  you,  and  I  will  make  known  My  words  unto  you”  (1:23).  When  we

Proverbs
studied Genesis  1,  we  saw  there  the  combined  work  of  the  Holy  Spirit  
and the Word of God in the remaking of the earth. Here we see that it 
is the same combination that produces wisdom in us. If we study God’s 
Word academically, we can’t get wisdom. God has to pour out His Spirit 
upon us so that His words become living to us. Someone studying the 
Bible without the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit would be similar to a 
man trying to read a book in total darkness. He can read nothing. But 
as  soon  as  the  lights  are  switched  on,  he  can  see  everything.  That  is  
what happens when the Spirit gives us revelation on His Word. God says, 
“I will make known My words” which refers to His giving revelation on His 
words. That is how we acquire wisdom.
He goes on to say that if you refuse wisdom’s invitation, one day when 
you are in trouble, and you call for help, you may not find it (1:24–33). 
You may not find wisdom late in life, if you have neglected it in your 
earlier years.
So it says in Chapter 2:4, “Seek for wisdom as you would seek for silver 
and hidden treasures. Then you will discern the fear of the Lord and the 
knowledge of God”. These are the two essentials that are repeated again 
and again in Proverbs – reverence for God and knowing God personally. 
The wisdom the Lord gives will deliver us “from the way of evil, from the 
man who speaks perverse things, and from the strange woman” (verses 
12, 16). Young men need to be protected from evil men who try to deceive 
them and evil women who try to attract them.
Guidance
Chapter 3:5, 6: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on 
your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will 
make your paths straight.” This is a promise of guidance. God will direct 
our paths if we fulfil the conditions. What are the conditions?
First of all: Trust in the Lord with all your heart and don’t lean on your 
own reason and intelligence. It doesn’t say there that we should not use 
our reason or intelligence, but not to depend on it. God created our powers 
of reasoning and our intelligence. But like God created Eve to be subject to 
Adam, reason must be subject to the Holy Spirit. A wife is most useful in a 
home. But if she takes over the headship of the home, there will be chaos 
– as when Eve took over the headship in Eden and sinned. We have to use 
our reason (and intelligence) to find God’s will, for it is a very capable “wife”. 
Without our intelligence we would not be able to study God’s Word or even 
live in this world. But we must depend on the Holy Spirit to enlighten our 
reason. Faith  is  not  contrary  to  reason  but  is  beyond  reason  –  just  like  
multiplication is not against addition but is beyond addition. 
Secondly: Acknowledge God in all your ways. That means to obey every 
single thing that God reveals to you. Give the Lord first place in every 
area of your life. Then the Lord will lead you in His perfect will.

314 Through the Bible: Words of Wisdom
Proverbs
The Lord has led me step by step over the last 56 years, as a believer. 
Many  a  time,  I  never  knew  what  the  next  step  would  be.  But  the  Lord  
has directed my paths. I pray that you will have the same joy as you look 
back over your life. 
“Honour  the  Lord  from  your  wealth”  (3:9).  We  must  learn  to  give  to  
God  joyfully  –  from  the  wealth  of  our  time,  our  energy,  our  money,  
our resources, our talents, our children, and every other area of our 
wealth.
“Do not reject the discipline of the Lord” (verse 11). Correction is essen-
tial for our spiritual growth.
Chapter  4:12  has  a  very  beautiful  promise.  A  literal  paraphrase  of  it  
would read: “As you go, step by step the way will open up before you.” You 
don’t need to know even what lies two steps ahead of you. Take the first 
step that you can see. You will then see the next step. This is how God 
guides us. Doors may look to be closed in front of us. But as we approach 
them, they will open automatically. But they won’t open until you come 
near  them.  That  is  how  our  God  leads  us  on.  So  don’t  be  hesitant  or  
afraid if you see a door closed in front of you. Take the step God shows 
you  now.  “I  have  put  before  you  an  open  door,”  says  the  Lord,  “which 
no-one can shut” (Revelation 3:8).
Chapter 4:15 is a good word concerning scenes of temptation: “Avoid it, 
do not pass by it; turn away from it and pass on.”
Chapter 4:18 is another wonderful verse: “The path of the righteous is 
like the light of dawn (when the sun rises) that shines brighter and brighter 
until the full day (noon-day).” This is God’s perfect will for everyone of His 
children – that they should become more and more like Christ every day 
of their lives, from the time that they are born again (when the sun rises), 
until the day that Christ comes back (noon-day). Along that path, we will 
get  more  and  more  revelation  on  God’s  Word,  more  and  more  light  on  
the corruption of our self-life, more and more wisdom for practical situ-
ations that we face, etc. If you walk along this path of the righteous, you 
will never backslide, just like the sun never goes back in the sky. Why 
then is it so rare to find Christians who live like this? Because most of 
Christendom lives at a substandard level. We must not let our life sink 
to the level of the believers around us. Our eyes must be fixed on the 
Lord  alone.  We  must  seek  to  walk  as  He  walked.  Unfortunately,  many  
Christian leaders today are not good examples. Look at God’s Word and 
look at Jesus. If you find a good example, like Paul, you can follow him 
too. Paul said, “Follow me as I follow Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1).
Chapter 4:23: “Watch over your heart with all diligence for from it flow 
the springs of life.” Everything that comes out of our life flows from our 
heart – our words, our ministry, everything. So we must ensure that our

Proverbs
hearts are kept pure at all times. Only thus will the channel be clean for 
the living waters to flow from heaven through us, to others.
Chapter 4:25: “Let your eyes look directly ahead and let your gaze be 
fixed straight in front of you.” This has reference to temptations that come 
through  the  eyes  and  is  very  good  advice  for  young  people.  Be  careful  
what you allow your eyes to look at. If you are tempted by what you see, 
look away. Set the Lord in front of you and look straight at Him. As long 
as we live in this world, we can’t avoid being tempted by what we see. But 
we can avoid the second look. We can destroy our life and our usefulness 
to God, if we don’t control our eyes.
Chapter 5:15: “Drink water out of your own well”. This is a warning to 
husbands to be satisfied with their own wives and not to long after other 
women  –  someone  else’s  well.  Sexual  enjoyment  is  perfectly  right  and  
good within marriage. It is evil and Satanic outside of marriage.
Chapter 6:6–10: “Go to the ant, O lazy man. Observe her ways and be 
wise”. The ant gathers food in harvest-time, because it has forethought 
for the future. It realises that food won’t be available in the winter. How 
small the brain of that ant is. Yet it has enough sense in that tiny brain 
to  store  food  for  the  future.  How  much  wiser  we  who  are  created  in  
God’s image should be! We should not spend all the money we earn each 
month, and have no savings at all for the future. I have met some “super-
spiritual” believers who live extravagantly and say that they trust God for 
all  their  future  emergencies.  But  when  such  an  emergency  does  arise,  
they end up having to borrow from other believers who have been wise 
like the ant! Or they wait like beggars, expecting other believers to come 
to their aid and give them gifts to meet their need. Why do you want to be 
like them? Be wise and discipline yourself now to save some money each 
month. The same principle applies in spiritual matters as well: Consider 
the matter of storing up God’s Word in your mind. Once you are married 
and have children, you won’t have enough time to study God’s Word. So, 
study it now, in your single days, when you have plenty of time and store 
up that knowledge for the future. Then you won’t starve spiritually later.
Chapter 6:21 exhorts us to bind God’s word continually on our heart, 
for  then,  “when  we  walk  about,  it  will  guide  us,  when  we  sleep  it  will  
watch over us, and when we wake up, it will talk to us” (6:22). God’s Word 
will guide us and keep us, day and night. If we are restless and unable 
to sleep properly at night, it could be because we have disobeyed God’s 
Word somewhere and have a bad conscience. A good conscience is the 
best pillow to sleep on. And when we wake up, God’s Word will guide us 
in each step of our daily life. That is how God wants us to live.
Chapter 7 tells the story of a very foolish young man who visits a loose 
woman without any morals. It is a strong warning to young people to be 
careful of all friendships and associations with women. One step leads to 
another very quickly in this area; and if you are not careful, you can have 
a  lifetime  of  regret.  Beware  of  flirtatious  women.  Women  have  ruined  

316 Through the Bible: Words of Wisdom
Proverbs
the lives of many fine young believers and robbed them of the ministry 
that  God  had  planned  for  them.  Young  men  should  read  this  chapter  
frequently.
Chapter 8 speaks about Wisdom (pictured as a wise woman) inviting 
people to listen to her. “Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching 
daily at my gates” (verse 34). We must listen to what God has to say to us 
every morning and throughout the day. That will protect us from many 
dangers.
Chapter  9:1:  Wisdom  builds  a  house  (the  church)  on  seven  pillars.  
These  seven  pillars  are  listed  in  James  3:17:  Being  pure,  peaceable,  
gentle,  reasonable,  full  of  mercy,  unwavering,  and  without  hypocrisy.  
The church is built on these pillars.
Guidelines for Godliness
Chapter  10:12  “Love  covers  all  sins.”  Peter  quotes  this  in  his  epistle  
(1  Peter  4:8).  If  you  really  love  a  person  you  will  cover  his  weaknesses  
and  not  expose  them.  That  is  how  God  has  dealt  with  us.  He  has  not 
exposed our past sins to anyone. We must treat others in the same way 
that God has treated us. If you want to be wise, let me give you, my dear 
brothers and sisters, one bit of advice in your youth. If you know a bad 
story about someone, let that story die with you. Don’t go around talking 
about it. God will honour you if you do that, especially if it is a bad story 
about one of His children. He will love you especially. Think of a father 
whose child has done something wrong and I know something about it; 
but I never tell anyone what his son did. Don’t you think that father will 
love me very much for that? It’s like that with God too, when He sees that 
we treat His children with love.
Chapter 10:22: “It is the blessing of the Lord that makes rich, and He 
adds  no  sorrow  to  it.”  Some  translations  put  that  last  part  as:  “Toiling 
does not increase it.” The blessing of the Lord provides us with all that 
we need for our life on earth. So let us always seek for the blessing of the 
Lord upon our lives.
Chapter 10:31: “The mouth of the righteous flows with wisdom.” You can 
know whether you are righteous or not by the way you speak. A right-
eous man’s mouth always comes forth with words of wisdom.
Chapter  11:3:  “The  integrity  of  the  upright  man  will  guide  him.” God 
looks for integrity and honesty first of all in us. And if we are honest, we 
will find that we are guided aright into God’s perfect will.
Chapter 11:24: “There is one who scatters, yet increases all the more.” 
This is one of the paradoxes of the Christian life that one who gives receives 
more,  because  God  blesses  him.  And  the  one  who  is  stingy  becomes  
poor. When a miser gets converted, he becomes generous. Jesus said to 
His disciples, “Freely you have received. Freely give” (Matthew 10:8). God 
has  freely  given  us  so  many  things.  We  must  give  to  others  freely  too.

Proverbs
The widow in the gospels, had only two mites. She gave what she had, 
and I am sure that God honoured her and she suffered no lack.
“He who waters others will himself be watered” (verse 25). If you want 
God to water you and keep you fresh, you must water others. Why are 
many  Christians  so  stale  and  dry?  Because  God  is  not  watering  them.  
And why is God not watering them? Because they are not watering others. 
Begin to think about the needs of others and see how you can bless them. 
You will then find that God blesses you abundantly.
Chapter 12:23: “A wise man conceals knowledge”. That means that a 
wise  man  is  reluctant  to  display  his  knowledge.  He  may  know  a  great  
deal; but he is modest about it. A foolish man however is ready to give his 
opinion on anything and everything.
Chapter  13:10:  “Through  presumption  comes  nothing  but  strife.”  All  
strife is the result of pride.
Chapter  14:12:  “There  is  a  way  which  seems  right  to  a  man,  but  its  
end is the way of death.” This verse is repeated in Chapter 16:25. So, in 
case you miss it the first time, God gives it to you a second time. What 
appears right in your eyes is not necessarily God’s way. Why is it that 
many believers do not earnestly seek God’s guidance about the decisions 
they  take?  Because  they  feel  they  know  enough  about  all  the  factors  
involved in their decisions. Years later they discover that they were wrong 
and  that  they  have  wasted  their  lives.  It  is  wise  to  be  humble  and  to  
acknowledge that we know almost nothing. So let us seek the Lord for 
His wisdom. Even in the study of the Scriptures, let us acknowledge that 
we are stupid and foolish and can go totally astray in our understanding 
of it if we are not given revelation by His Spirit. God says to us, “My ways 
are not your ways” (Isaiah 55:8).
Chapter 15:13: “A joyful heart makes a cheerful face.” It is joy in the heart 
that brings brightness on our faces. “A cheerful heart has a continual feast” 
(verse 15). There is a great emphasis in Proverbs on having joy in our life. 
“A joyful heart is good medicine” (17:22). So joy can make us healthy too. 
The kingdom of God is not just righteousness, but righteousness with joy 
in the Holy Spirit. In the Old Testament they had righteousness without 
joy. Now we have righteousness with joy. There is a spring in our steps, a 
song in our hearts and a light on our faces as we follow Jesus.
Chapter  16:18:  “Pride  goes  before  destruction  and  a  haughty  spirit  
before  a  fall.”  The  reason  anyone  falls  into  sin  is  because  he  is  proud.  
When  we  do  something  stupid,  we  can  be  absolutely  certain  that  the  
cause was pride. The Lord is able to keep us from falling (Jude 24). How 
does He do that? By humbling us to ground level! If we stand or even sit 
we can fall. But when we are flat on our faces on the ground, we cannot 
fall!! So let us keep our mouth in the dust at all times if we don’t want 
to fall. No matter how much God may bless us or use us, let us keep in 
mind our littleness before God. Thus we will become worshippers of God; 
and we will never fall.

Proverbs
Chapter 17:9: “He who covers a transgression seeks love.” Did some-
body do you some wrong? Did someone hurt you or insult you? Forgive it 
and ignore it. That is the way of love that a godly man walks in.
Chapter 17:28: “Even a fool when he keeps silent is considered wise.” 
If  you  are  foolish,  but  want  people  to  consider  you  wise,  what  should  
you do? Keep your mouth shut!! People will then imagine: “He is a man 
of deep wisdom. That’s why he’s silent”!! If you had opened your mouth 
there, everyone would have known immediately that you were a fool. So 
be quick to hear and slow to speak, especially when you are young and 
foolish. What blessings there are when we are restrained in our speech.
Chapter  18:12:  “Humility  goes  before  honour.”  Are  you  seeking  for  
honour from God? Then humble yourself.
Chapter 18:16: “A man’s gift makes room for him and brings him before 
great men.” It is through the gift God gives us that He makes room for 
us to serve in the church. It’s pathetic to see many today who have no 
God-given gifts, who are seeking and fighting for place and honour in the 
church.  We  are  urged  to  “pursue  after  spiritual  gifts,  especially  that  we  
may prophesy” (1 Corinthians 14:1). To prophesy is to speak the Word of 
God in a way that challenges, convicts, comforts, encourages and builds 
up  (1  Corinthians  14:3).  God  doesn’t  give  His  gifts  to  those  who  don’t  
value them. People will travel hundreds of miles to listen to a man who 
has a message from God. John the Baptist was in the wilderness and the 
people from all over Judea went out there to hear him, because he had a 
message from heaven.
Chapter 18:19: “A brother offended is harder to be won than a city.” This 
is why we need to be careful in what we say to one another, to ensure that 
relationships are not broken.
Chapter 18:21: “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.” On the 
day of Pentecost, tongues of fire appeared over the disciples to show that 
God wanted to set their tongues on fire with the fire of the Holy Spirit. 
James 3:6 says that the tongue can be set on fire with the fire of hell too. 
Given the corruption of our flesh, it is only if our tongue is controlled by 
the Holy Spirit that we can be saved from spreading death through our 
tongues.
Chapter 19:17: “He who is gracious to a poor man lends to the Lord. And 
He will repay him for his good deed”. The poor belong to God and He 
considers anything that we do for the poor as something done for Him 
– and that is why He promises to repay us for our kindnesses.
Chapter 19:18: “Discipline your son while there is hope and do not cause 
him  to  die.”  There  are  many  verses  in  Proverbs about  disciplining  our  
children if we want to save them from hell.
Chapter 20:14: “‘Bad, bad,’ says the buyer, but when he goes his way 
then he boasts”. Most people use this technique in India to get something

at a lower price from a shopkeeper. I have seen believers argue even with 
poor vegetable-vendors, just to get something for one rupee less. Is that 
Christlike? That poor man is struggling to support his family. God has 
given you far more than him. Be generous. Let us be good to the people 
around us, and especially to the poor.
Chapter 21:2: “Every man’s way is right in his own eyes, but the Lord 
weighs the hearts.” God looks at the motive more than the action. We 
must always remember that. 
Chapter 21:13: “He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor will also cry 
himself and not be answered.” God treats us as we treat others – espe-
cially the poor. This is why God does not answer the prayers of many 
believers.
Chapter 21:19: “It is better to live in a desert land than with a contentious 
and vexing woman.” Here we see what God thinks about a nagging wife.
Chapter  22:4:  “The  reward  of  humility  and  the  fear  of  the  Lord  are  
riches, honour and life.” Spiritual riches, spiritual honour, and spiritual 
life come from God and are given on the basis of two qualities that He 
looks for in man: Humility and the fear of the Lord. These are the main 
qualities that we should look for, when considering someone for a posi-
tion of leadership in the church.
Chapter 22:6, 15: “Train up a child in the way he should go. Even when 
he is old he will not depart from it. Foolishness is bound up in the heart 
of a child. The rod of discipline will remove it far from him.” To remove 
the foolishness found in the heart of a child, you have to apply some 
discipline to his bottom. There is obviously a close connection between 
a child’s bottom and his heart! If a child is disciplined wisely in love, 
he will follow the Lord when he grows up and leaves home to face an 
evil world.
 Chapter 22:29: “Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand 
before  kings.”  This  is  a  good  verse  to  apply  to  the  disciplined  study  of  
God’s  Word  and  to  diligence  in  serving  the  Lord.  God  will  open  many  
doors of ministry for such a man to serve His children (who are the real 
kings on earth).
Chapter 23:22: “Listen to your father who begot you and don’t despise 
your mother when she is old.” Many children today unfortunately, do not 
honour and respect their aged parents. This is not only sad, but evil. God 
takes special note of those who honour their parents and blesses them 
in special ways.
Chapter 23:31: “Don’t look on the wine when it is red, when it sparkles 
in  the  cup.”  This  is  an  exhortation  to  avoid  all  highly-fermented  wine  

320 Through the Bible: Words of Wisdom
Proverbs
(any  drink  with  a  high  content  of  alcohol).  The  wine  that  Jesus  drank  
and that He made at Cana must therefore have been home-made wine 
that was not highly fermented – because we know that Jesus obeyed all 
of God’s Word and so He must have obeyed this verse too.
Chapter 24:11, 12: “Deliver those who are being taken away to death. If 
you say, ‘See, we did not know this,’ does He not consider it Who weighs 
the hearts?” This verse can be taken today as a challenge to engage in 
evangelism. The world around us needs to hear the gospel and we need 
to give it to them.
Chapter 24:17: “Do not rejoice when your enemy falls.” Even in the Old 
Testament, they were told not to rejoice over the fall of their enemies.
Chapter 24:27: “Prepare your work outside and make it ready for your-
self in the field; afterwards then, build your house.” This is good advice 
for all young men considering marriage. First get a job, then get married. 
Earn enough money to support a family, and then look for a wife to build 
your family.
Chapter 24:30–34: Here we read of a lazy man who didn’t take care of his 
field and so the field was covered with thorns. He slept while others were 
working. The warning here is that poverty can strike us if we sleep like 
that. Henry Longfellow (an English poet) wrote a poem in which he said:
“The heights by great men reached and kept
Were not attained by sudden flight.
But they while their companions slept
Were toiling upwards in the night.”
God told Adam that he must earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. 
God rewards diligence. One who studies the Word and obeys it diligently 
will  have  a  fruitful  life  when  compared  with  the  believer  who  is  lazy.  
A  diligent  man  will  have  a  good  garden  and  a  blessed  ministry.  A  lazy  
man however will have many regrets both on earth and in eternity.
Chapter 25:14: “Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts 
of  his  gifts  falsely.”  There  are  many  preachers  today,  who  claim  to  
have gifts of healing and other supernatural gifts, who are only fooling 
simple-minded  believers.  That  is  compared  here  to  a  farmer  seeing  
clouds in the sky and hoping that his fields will get rain, and getting 
nothing! Don’t ever claim to have a gift that you don’t have. If you have 
a gift, it will be evident to others. If God has given you the gift of evan-
gelism, you will bring many people to the Lord – not just one or two. If 
God has given you the gift of teaching, many people will be enlightened 
through your ministry – not just one or two. If God has given you a gift 
of healing, then many will be healed when you pray for them – not just 
one or two. If people are not healed in large numbers, that proves that 
you don’t have the gift.

Proverbs
Chapter 26:4 says, “Do not answer a fool according to his folly”. But the 
very next verse says, “Answer a fool according to his folly” (verse 5). Which 
of these two statements is right? The answer is: Both are right, because 
they  refer  to  two  types  of  fools.  Jesus  answered  the  questions  that  His  
disciples  asked  him.  But  when  the  Pharisees  asked  Him  questions,  He  
did not give them such clear replies. And to Herod, He gave no reply at all. 
So when people ask us questions, we must discern which type of fool the 
person is. We need the discernment of the Holy Spirit to know that.
Chapter  26:27:  “He  who  digs  a  pit  will  fall  into  it;  and  he  who  rolls  a  
stone, it will come back on him.” This is a warning that those who seek 
to harm others will find the evil they plan coming back to harm them. 
Haman is one example of this.
Chapter 27:1: “Do not boast about tomorrow for you do not know what 
a day may bring forth.” James tells us that we must recognise that we 
cannot be certain whether we will live for even a single more day (James 
4:15). A constant awareness of this fact should keep us all humble. 
Chapter 27:2: “Let another man praise you and not your own mouth.” 
There  is  a  lot  of  self-promotion  in  Christendom  today,  which  is  totally  
foreign to the Spirit of Christ.
Chapter 27:23: “Know well the condition of your flocks and pay atten-
tion to your herds.” That is a good word for those who are shepherds of 
God’s flock. A good elder will know the spiritual condition of every one of 
the believers in his church.
Chapter 28:13: “He who conceals his sins will not prosper. But he who 
confesses and forsakes them will find mercy.” That is one of the clearest 
verses  in  the  Bible  that  teaches  that  confessing  our  sins  to  God  is  not  
enough. We need to give them up too. 
Chapter  29:1:  “A  man  who  hardens  his  neck  after  much  reproof  will  
suddenly  be  broken  beyond  remedy.”  No-one  should  keep  on  taking  
advantage of God’s mercy and goodness, because he will suddenly find 
one  day  that  he  has  crossed  “the  red  line”  and  the  Holy  Spirit  stops  
pleading with him and he can never be saved thereafter.
Chapter 29:18: “Where there is no vision, the people perish.” The great 
need in Christendom today is for men and women of vision. God wants 
to give all of us a vision of what He can accomplish in our land through 
us at this time. Ask God to give you a burden for India.
Chapter 29:20: “Do you see a man who is hasty in his words (or hasty 
in his matters)? There is more hope for a fool than for him.” This is the last 
chapter of the proverbs of Solomon, and we are now seven verses from 
the end. In all these 29 chapters Solomon has been describing various 
types of fools. Finally, before he concludes, he says, “Now let me tell you 
who is the greatest fool of all – The man who is quick to speak and who is 
hasty in making his decisions. He gets the first prize!” There is more hope 
for all the other fools mentioned in this book than for the hasty man!

Proverbs
Chapter 30 was written by a man named Agur. In verse 7, 8, he says, 
“Two  things  I  asked  of  Thee.  Do  not  refuse  me  before  I  die.  (1)  Keep  
deception and lies far from me. (2) Give me neither poverty nor riches.” 
In Old Testament times they had to pray that prayer, because they felt 
(as it says in the rest of this verse) that if they were poor they would steal 
and if they became too rich they might forsake the Lord! 90% of believers 
need to pray that prayer too, because too much money would ruin them. 
But that is a very shallow level to live at. Paul, however, said, “It doesn’t 
matter  to  me  whether  I  am  poor  or  rich.  I  can  handle  both”  (Philippians 
4:12). Riches would not destroy Paul and poverty would not make him 
drift away from the Lord. There are a number of good proverbs in the rest 
of the chapter that are worth meditating on.
Chapter 31 was written by a king named Lemuel and he lists some of the 
things that his mother taught him. After some good advice in verses 1 
to 9, we come to the last section, verses 10–31. This is a very important 
section for all young men and women, because it tells us the qualities 
of  a  godly  wife.  All  young  women  should  seek  to  be  like  this  and  all  
young men should look for such a woman to marry. Notice the number 
of things mentioned about this godly wife: She works with her hands 
and  is  a  very  hard  working  person.  She  gets  up  early  and  cooks  the  
meals. She is enterprising too. She buys a field and plants a vineyard 
there with her own hands. She spins clothes with her own hands. She 
gives money to the poor. She protects her children in winter, with warm 
clothing that she has stitched herself. She supports her husband and 
her husband trusts her fully. She makes clothes and sells them. She is 
dignified and she speaks with wisdom. She has the law of kindness on 
her tongue. So we see that her hands are hard and her tongue is soft. 
Unfortunately, with many young sisters today, things are exactly the 
opposite. Their hands are soft (because they have never worked hard) 
and their tongue is hard (they are proud and rude). “Charm is deceitful 
and beauty is empty. But a woman who fears the Lord shall be praised” 
(verse 30). Her husband and her children rise up and praise her as the 
best wife and mother in the world.
Young men, this is the type of wife you should be looking for. 
Young women, this is the type of woman you should be.
And all young people: Read Proverbs frequently so that you can grow up 
to be godly and wise men and women whom God can use.

ECCLESIASTES
The Vanity of Worldliness
T
his is a difficult book to understand, but we will discover as we 
study it, that there is a reason why God has placed it in Scripture.
Solomon  begins  by  saying  that  he  has  found  everything  in  the  
world  to  be  futile  and  empty.  Since  that  is  so,  “what  advantage  does  a  
man have in all the work that he does?” (1:3). 
Solomon was the wisest man that lived – as far as human wisdom was 
concerned. The Lord had told him that he would have wisdom such as no 
one had ever had before him or would have after him (1 Kings 3:12, 13). 
In the early years of Solomon’s life, he had some fear of God and that was 
when he wrote Proverbs. 
Proverbs is divine wisdom. Ecclesiastes, however, is human wisdom – 
the wisdom of the man who lives “under the sun” (1:3). The expression 
‘under the sun’ comes often in Ecclesiastes, because its writer lived under 
the sun. Proverbs, however, demonstrates the wisdom of a man who lived 
above the sun. This is where we are called to live – in the heavenlies.
Then why has God placed the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible?
The Bible describes human wisdom in order to show how much higher 
divine wisdom is than that. A large portion of the book of Job consists 
of the speeches of three preachers who said much about God with their 
human  wisdom,  but  which  was  mostly  all  wrong  (Job  42:7).  Yet  God  
allowed their words to be recorded in Scripture.
Ecclesiastes has been included in Scripture to show us that even the 
wisest man on earth can miss finding God when he depends on his 
human  cleverness.  Jesus  once  said, “I  thank  You,  Father,  that  You  
have  hidden  these  things  from  the  clever  and  the  intelligent,  but  You  
have revealed them unto babes” (Matthew 11:25). What do babes have 
that clever and intelligent people do not have? Humility. It is very diffi-
cult for a clever, intelligent person to be humble. It is not wrong to be 

324 Through the Bible: The Vanity of Worldliness
Ecclesiastes
intelligent, but it is certainly ungodly to be proud of one’s intelligence. 
Proud men can never understand God’s ways, no matter how intelli-
gent they may be. 
Even  though  Solomon  was  the  wisest  and  most  intelligent  man  that  
ever lived, and even though he was the one who was going to build God’s 
temple, yet God gave the plan of the temple to David and not to Solomon. 
It is really amazing to read in 1 Chronicles 28:11–19 that the wisest man 
in the world had to be told how much gold he should use for the lamp-
stand and how to make forks! Why was the plan given to David? Because 
David was a man after God’s own heart. Solomon was a man who had a 
clever head, but David had a good heart.
God  gave  the  plan  of  the  tabernacle  to  Moses  not  when  he  was  40,  
but  when  he  was  80.  Why?  At  40,  he  was  full  of  the  wisdom  of  Egypt  
and would have modified God’s plan considerably. Then the glory of God 
would not have rested on the tabernacle. But by the time Moses was 80, 
the chaff of human wisdom had been sifted out of his head, and he was 
willing to submit to God’s wisdom. Then he constructed the tabernacle 
as a simple structure – as God intended it to be.
It was so with the temple too. Solomon was only the contractor who built 
it. The one who got the plan from God was David – “the man after God’s own 
heart”. Even today, God does not reveal His plan for building the church as 
the Body of Christ, to clever people with good brains, but to humble people 
with good hearts. If you are intelligent and also humble, that is fine. But the 
primary requirement for God’s work is humility, not intelligence.
1 Corinthians 3:18 says, “If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this 
age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.” Thank God for 
the intelligence He has given you. That is very useful in the study of 
science and mathematics. But when it comes to Scripture, it is differ-
ent. Here you have to become foolish in order to be wise. That means 
that you have to come to God in humility and say, “Lord, in spiritual 
matters I am as stupid as a donkey. Please teach me”. The cleverness 
of this world is foolishness with God (1 Corinthians 3:19). That is what 
the book of Ecclesiastes demonstrates.
It is written further that “God catches the clever in their craftiness. The 
reasonings of the clever are useless” (1 Corinthians 3:19, 20). Take all the 
reasonings and arguments of the cleverest people in the world and put 
them all together, and God says that all of it is useless. When it comes to 
spiritual things it is the one who is humble who has a great advantage. 
And  the  person  who  is  proud  of  his  intelligence  and  cleverness  has  a  
tremendous disadvantage.
If  intelligence  had  been  the  main  requirement  to  serve  God,  then  
Jesus would have gone to the Bible school that Gamaliel was running at 

  325
Ecclesiastes
Jerusalem, and selected His apostles from there. Why didn’t He do that? 
Why did He go to the lakeside in Galilee, and pick fishermen who had 
never been to a Bible school? Because He was not looking for clever men 
but for humble men, who were willing to learn. 
Are you teachable? If you are offended by what you are reading, that 
would  be  the  clearest  proof  that  you  are  proud.  Only  proud  people  get  
offended.
Ecclesiastes demonstrates how one can have a lot of knowledge and yet 
not be spiritual at all. The human wisdom that is found in psychology 
today has many good things in it. But it is not divine wisdom. And it is 
more dangerous when divine wisdom is mixed with human wisdom than 
if you had human wisdom all by itself. If someone wanted to poison you, 
he would mix a little bit of poison with a lot of milk. Things that are totally 
bad are easy to detect. But psychology has a lot of good in it – and that is 
why it can be dangerous. It is not divine wisdom. Divine wisdom comes 
from the Scriptures alone. Many things that psychologists say, who do 
not submit their minds to God’s Word, are wrong. If you follow them, you 
will go astray.
The Books of Ecclesiastes and Proverbs can be compared to the offer-
ings of Cain and Abel. Cain’s offering was a religious offering. Abel’s was a 
spiritual offering. Throughout the ages, there has been a constant conflict 
between religious people and spiritual people. Saul was a religious person 
–  a  man  of  the  head.  But  David  was  a  spiritual  person  –  a  man  of  the  
heart. The Pharisees were religious. But Jesus was spiritual. Our brain 
is  important.  But  it  was  created  to  be  subservient  to  the  heart  and  the  
Holy Spirit, even as Eve was created to submit to Adam. The streams of 
religiosity and spirituality that began with Cain and Abel, continued on 
with  Nimrod  and  Abraham,  and  ends  with  Babylon  and  Jerusalem  in  
Revelation. We see a similar contrast between Ecclesiastes and Proverbs.
Ecclesiastes contains  the  words  of  a  preacher  (1:1).  Most  preachers  
are interested only in preaching good sermons. And for that, they use 
only their heads. Therefore, their sermons do not go to people’s hearts 
– because it does not come from their own hearts.
Proverbs doesn’t  deal  with  preaching but  with  practising.  We  must  
preach  only  what  we  have  already  practised.  This  is  the  difference  
between  religiosity  and  spirituality.  This  was  the  difference  between  
the  Pharisees  and  Jesus.  Jesus  said,  “The  Pharisees  say  things  but  
do not do them” (Matthew 23:3). But He said there was nothing wrong 
with what they taught. The Pharisees were the fundamentalists of their 
time. But they did not live what they preached in the pulpit.
With Jesus it was different: “Jesus (first) did and then taught” (Acts.1:1). 
He  did  not  practise what  He  preached,  but  He  preached  what  He  had  

326 Through the Bible: The Vanity of Worldliness
Ecclesiastes
already practised. He practised for thirty years before He preached. That 
is true godliness.
The Emptiness of Everything on Earth
The  first two  chapters  of Ecclesiastes  speak  about  the  emptiness  of  
knowledge, pleasure, achievements and labour. Right through the book, 
it becomes obvious that the writer does not know God personally. Yet he 
spoke about God. He never uses the covenant name of God – Yehovah 
or Yahweh –  even  once  in  the  whole  book.  Proverbs uses  that  word  
frequently. The writer here has no covenant relationship with his God. 
He only had an academic knowledge of God, a knowledge about the facts 
concerning God. It may have been an accurate knowledge of God, but it 
was not the result of a heart-relationship or a covenant-relationship.
At the end of the book, the writer asks, “What then is the conclusion of 
everything?” And he answers it thus: “Fear God and keep His command-
ments.” There is nothing wrong with that. But why does he say that we 
should fear God and keep His commandments? Is it because He is a good 
God and because we love Him? No. It is because one day God will judge 
everything that is hidden, whether it be good or evil (12:14).
The religious man does good things out of fear of judgement. That is 
how every false religion operates. They teach you to be good, in order to 
avoid judgement and to be rewarded in the next life! False Christianity 
preaches the same thing. Where the primary motivation for our obeying 
God is the fear of being judged, there we have a false Christianity. Jesus 
said, “If you love Me, keep My commandments” (John 14:15).
True spirituality is not motivated by the fear of judgement, but by love. 
Jesus  did  not  obey  the  Father  because  He  was  afraid  that  the  Father  
would  punish  Him,  but  because  He  loved  the  Father.  That  must  be  
the  motivation  for  our  obedience  too.  But  that’s  not  what  the  writer  of  
Ecclesiastes had. His attitude to life was one of fatalism and indifference. 
He decided to brace himself to whatever happens so that he would never 
be  surprised  at  anything.  He  didn’t  know  much  about  eternity,  even  
though  he  mentions  it  once.  He  was  afraid  of  death  and  he  decided  to  
make the most of this earthly life, with a little bit of “fear of God” thrown 
in, just to be on the safe side.
Here  was  a  person  who  sought  to  discover  God  through  his  senses,  
his intelligence and his reasoning, without the help of the Holy Spirit. 
Christians who do that will go as much astray from the truth as those 
who  follow  other  religions.  We  can  know  nothing  about  God  without  
the help of the Holy Spirit, for He alone can reveal to us the deep things 
of  God.  “The  thoughts  of  God  no  one  knows  except  the  Spirit  of  God” 
(1 Corinthians 2:11).

The Emptiness of Everything on Earth                                                                                                  327
Ecclesiastes
The people who crucified Christ were those who studied the Bible every 
day. They studied about the Messiah. But when He came into their midst, 
they  called  him  “the  prince  of  devils”!  If  the  Greeks  and  Romans  had  
called Jesus by such a name, we can understand it, because they didn’t 
have the Old Testament. It was not even the liberal Sadducees who called 
Jesus  by  that  name.  It  was  the  fundamentalist  Pharisees.  They  were  
intelligent.  But  they  were  not  humble.  Their  head  was  right,  but  their  
heart was not right.  That  happened  2000  years  ago  and  it  can  happen  
today. If we don’t live in humble dependence on the Holy Spirit to give 
us revelation on God’s Word, we will go as much astray as Solomon did.
When Peter looked at Jesus and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of 
the Living God,” Jesus replied saying, “Blessed are you, Simon, for flesh 
and  blood  has  not  revealed this  to  you  but  My  Father  in  heaven.”  That  
means  that  it  was  not  Peter’s  human  cleverness  that  enabled  him  to  
understand this truth. How could an unlearned person like Peter know 
who Jesus was, when the Pharisees who studied the Scriptures day and 
night could not? That is because the truths of God can be known only by 
the revelation of the Holy Spirit. That’s what Peter had and the Pharisees 
didn’t. So, if you want to understand God’s Word aright, depend on the 
Holy Spirit. 
Solomon tried to find satisfaction through various forms of pleasure, 
acquiring property, making ponds of water (2:6), having many slaves 
(2:7), collecting plenty of silver and gold, etc. “Everything that my eyes 
desired, I did not refuse them” (2:10). At the end of it all he says, “Thus 
I considered all my activities and there was no profit under the sun” 
(2:11). He then talks about the futility of hard work, because “all the 
fruit of his labour he would have to leave to somebody who came after 
him, and who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool!” “Under 
the sun everything was vanity” (2:21, 22).
We  read  something  interesting  in  Chapter  2:26:  “To  a  person  who  is  
good in God’s sight, God has given wisdom, knowledge and joy.” This is 
a true statement. If your heart is clear, God gives you opportunities on 
earth  to  accumulate  divine  wisdom,  the  knowledge  of  Himself  and  the  
fullness of joy that there is in His presence. But what task does God give 
a sinner? The task of gathering, collecting and hoarding money and other 
material things, so that one day they can all be given to the man who is 
seeking God’s kingdom first! (verse 26). In eternity, the meek will inherit 
the earth. There is no doubt about that.
All of us are either pursuing after wisdom, the knowledge of God and 
the joy of the Lord, or we are hoarding, collecting and gathering earthly 
things. There we see the clear contrast between a spiritual person and 
a worldly person. Religious people are worldly too. They may know their 
Bibles,  but  they  do  not  know  God.  And  so  they  too  spend  their  time  

328 Through the Bible: The Vanity of Worldliness
Ecclesiastes
pursuing after material things and worldly knowledge that will not help 
them in eternity.
Proof that All is Empty
In Chapters  3  to  6  Solomon  tries  to  prove  that  everything  on  earth  is  
vanity. 
Chapter 3:1–8: Solomon was a keen observer of human nature and the 
world. After many years of observation, he discovered that there was a 
time and a season for everything that happened. There are true and false 
statements  here.  Psychology  is  a  mixture  of  truth  and  error.  Solomon  
says that there is a time to give birth, a time to die and a time to plant. 
All of that is correct. But then he goes on to say that there is a time to kill 
and a time to hate! For a spiritual man, there is never a time to kill or to 
hate – and there are no human beings he hates. A spiritual man dwells 
in God and loves all people, all the time.
There are psychologists who teach that if you are angry with your father, 
the  way  to  get  rid  of  your  anger  is  by  beating  a  pillow,  imagining  that  
that pillow is your father! Solomon probably believed something like that 
when he said that there’s a time to hate. But that’s not God’s way. Jesus 
said,  “Love  your  enemies.”  So  here  is  an  example  of  Solomon’s  worldly  
thinking  coming  in  to  this  book.  Religious  preachers  add  their  worldly  
wisdom to God’s Word when they preach. We have got to be careful here. 
If we don’t live in humility and brokenness before God, it is easy to be led 
astray by human wisdom, because much of it sounds right.
Let me give you one example: A new teaching has arisen in Christendom 
called “visualising”. This teaches something like this: “Close your eyes 
and visualise that you are going to have 5000 people in your church, 
even if you have only 5 right now. Visualise that you are meeting in a 
very large building, even if you are meeting only in a small house at 
present.  If  you  are  lame,  visualise yourself  walking.  If  you  only  own  
a  scooter,  visualise yourself  owning  a  nice,  new  car.  Then  you  will  
have the faith necessary to get these things – and you will get them.” 
Most of such visualisation is in relation to earthly luxuries and large 
church-buildings  etc.  I  have  never  heard  anyone  teaching  people  to  
visualise themselves “taking up the cross and dying to themselves and 
following Jesus”!! The teaching of visualisation comes from the modern 
“New Age” philosophy (which is a counterfeit of Divine truth) and from 
psychology, not from  the  Bible.  Yet  many  believers  who  don’t  have  
discernment imagine that this is how they can increase their faith.
Faith is not based on visualisation. Romans 10:17 is clear that “faith 
comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of Christ”. Faith can be based 
only  on  what  God  has  spoken.  Abraham  could  not  have  got  Isaac  by  
visualising that Sarah would give birth to a boy. His faith was based on 

Proof that All is Empty                                                                                                                             329
Ecclesiastes
God’s clear promise. You can’t start visualising whatever you want and 
expect God to give that to you. That’s the teaching of psychology, not of 
the Bible. Positive thinking may be good for business people, but it is not 
Biblical faith. Jesus and the apostles did not do miracles by visualisation 
or  by  positive  thinking.  It’s  easy  in  these  days,  to  be  deceived  by  such  
counterfeits. The book of Ecclesiastes, therefore, has a warning for all of 
us in these days, of the danger of depending on human wisdom.
The word “eternity” occurs just once in this book – in 3:11: “He has set 
eternity in their heart, without which man will not be able to find out the 
work  which  God  has  done”  (literal  translation).  There  is  a  God-shaped  
vacuum in every human heart that can never be filled or satisfied by 
anyone or anything other than God. As someone has put it, “We are rest-
less until we find our rest in God”. God has put eternity in our hearts so 
that we will never find satisfaction in money, women, property, honour or 
position. It goes on to say here that unless we give primary importance to 
the eternal things, we will never be able to find out what God has done. 
For those who live for “things under the sun”, “there is nothing better 
than to rejoice and to do good in one’s lifetime” (verse 12). Religious people 
and psychologists don’t tell people to do evil. No. They tell people to do 
good. But you can do a lot of good and still have no contact with God and 
still not live for eternity’s values.
In 3:19–21,  we  see  how  human  wisdom  has  no  clue  about  eternity:  
“The fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies, 
so dies the other, and there is no advantage for man over the beast. They 
came from dust, they go back to dust. Who knows whether the breath of 
man ascends upwards and the breath of beasts descends downwards to 
the earth?” This was Solomon’s conclusion, with all his human wisdom. 
He  did  not  know  whether  there  was  any  difference  between  man  and  
beast when they both died.
In this book, we see the wisest man on earth trying to understand God 
and religion. He got a few things right, and many things wrong. Why then 
did God allow Ecclesiastes to be included in the Bible: To teach us that 
we cannot find Him through human wisdom and psychology, but only 
through His Holy Spirit. We must beware of the teaching of clever people 
who do not know Jesus personally. If someone’s teaching is not founded 
on God’s Word, we should not waste our time listening to such a man.
Chapter  4:4:  “I  have  seen  that  every  labour  and  every  skill  which  is  
done is the result of rivalry between a man and his neighbour”. Solomon 
observed  that  most  people  in  the  world  are  motivated  by  the  spirit  
of  competition.  But  sadly  this  is  true  of  much  of  Christendom  too.  
Christian  organisations  grab  workers  from  other  Christian  organisa-
tions by offering them higher salaries. That is the spirit of this world. 
A godly man will never compete with anyone else – whether man, or 
church, or organisation.

330 Through the Bible: The Vanity of Worldliness
Ecclesiastes
There are some really good statements in 4:9–12.
“Two  are  better  than  one  because  they  have  a  good  return  for  their  
labour” (4:9). A husband and wife working together can accomplish much 
more for God than if they worked separately. They also multiply and have 
children,  and  thus  more  is  accomplished  than  if  they  had  been  single.  
This applies to brothers and sisters in a church too. 
Here is a second reason why two are better than one: “If one of them 
falls, the other can lift him up” (4:10). It is wonderful when a church is 
like that – with brothers and sisters who are eager to lift up one who has 
fallen into sin or discouragement, etc. But alas, “the Lord’s army is the 
only army that shoots its own wounded”.
“Woe unto him who is alone when he falls and he doesn’t have anybody 
to lift him up” (4:10). It is dangerous to live the Christian life alone and 
without fellowship.
Here is a third reason for fellowship: “If two are together they can be 
warm” (4:11). We can keep the fire burning in each other’s hearts when 
we have fellowship. If you can’t stay on fire for God on your own, then 
you must seek fellowship with those who are on fire for God.
And a fourth reason: “If one can overpower him who is alone, two can 
resist him” (4:12). Jesus said, “Where two or three are gathered together 
in My name (to glorify My Name), and where they are one in spirit with 
each other, there I am in their midst, and then whatever they bind on 
earth  will  be  bound  in  the  heavenlies”  (Matthew  18:18–20). Satanic 
activities can be bound and restrained by two believers who are totally 
one  with  each  other.  A  believer  cannot  do  that  alone,  because  that  
needs an expression of the Body of Christ – and the minimum for that 
is two.
“A cord of three strands is not quickly torn apart” (4:12). Three strands 
are necessary for a strong marriage – the husband, the wife and the Lord. 
If the Lord is not in the centre of a marriage, that marriage cannot prosper.
Here is a good word about correction: “A poor, wise, young man is much 
better  than  an  old  and  foolish  king  who  does  not  know  how  to  receive  
correction” (4:13). It is easy to become a foolish king. When God has raised 
us to a position of spiritual leadership, it is easy to imagine that we are 
always  right,  and  that  no-one  can  correct  us  any  more.  May  God  save  
us from ever coming to that place of folly. I thank God for young people 
who  have  corrected  me.  I  have  received  their  correction  and  become  a  
better man. If there is a black mark on my face that I cannot see, I should 
be thankful to anyone who points it out to me, so that I can wipe it off. 
It  doesn’t  matter  whether  that  person  is  20  years  old  or  80  years  old.  
He has helped me. Many Christian leaders have become old and foolish 
kings, because they refused to be corrected. A wise man is always willing 
to receive correction.

Ecclesiastes
In Chapter 5:1–3, we are told not to speak much when we are in God’s 
presence: “Don’t be hasty in word or in thought to bring up a matter in the 
presence of God because God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore 
let your words be few” (verse 2). In prayer, we must listen more than we 
speak. Prayer is like a telephone conversation with God. A telephone has 
an earpiece for listening and a mouthpiece for speaking. When you speak 
to someone far more mature than you, do you speak more or listen more? 
Only a proud person would talk more than listen to someone more godly 
than him. Then how should it be when we are with God in prayer? Most 
Christians  never  give  God  a  chance  to  speak  to  them  when  they  pray.  
They do all the talking. That is insulting God. 
Prayer  should  be  90%  listening  and  10%  speaking.  Our  heavenly  
Father already knows about every problem and everything that we need. 
But He still wants us to express our desires to Him and that is why He 
asks us to pray. Prayer doesn’t have to be only on our knees. Jesus told 
us to “pray always” (Luke 18:1). So we must develop the habit of listening 
to God always. We have all seen police officers with their “walkie-talkies”. 
These radio-sets are always kept on, because those officers have to be 
alert  to  any  message  that  comes  from  their  headquarters  at  any  time.  
That is a beautiful picture of how we should also live – always alert to 
listen to orders from our headquarters in heaven.
“Don’t make vows to God that you cannot pay. It is better not to make a 
vow than to vow and not pay” (5:4, 5). We should never make promises to 
God that we can’t keep. We must not tell lies to God when we sing songs 
of devotion and surrender to the Lord. Don’t sing, “Take my silver and 
my gold – not a mite would I withhold,” if you don’t mean it. Don’t sing, 
“Take my voice and let me sing always only for my King”, if you also sing 
worldly songs. Don’t sing, “All to Jesus I surrender”, if you haven’t actu-
ally surrendered everything in your life to the Lord. Christians tell more 
lies to God on Sundays than on any other day of the week because that 
is the day when they sing such songs in their meetings. When you find 
words in a song that are not yet true of your life, you can sing them as a 
prayer and not as a testimony. Tell the Lord that that is how you want to 
live. Then you are honest. But if the life described in one line of a song 
is not even your longing, then in all honesty, you must keep quiet when 
you come to that line. If others are telling lies, let them sing lies to God. 
But you be honest yourself. 
Chapter  5:10:  “He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, 
nor  he  who  loves  abundance  with  income.  This  too  is  empty.”  Someone  
has  said,  “God  has  made  enough  in  this  world  for  every  man’s  need, 
but not enough for even one man’s greed.” A greedy man will never be 
happy no matter how much money he makes. Even the millionaire wants 
more.  Jesus  said  that  we  cannot  love  God  and  money  (Luke  16:13) – 
because  they  are  opposites.  “When  good  things  increase  (when  your  
salary increases), your expenses increase too” (5:11). The undisciplined 

332 Through the Bible: The Vanity of Worldliness
Ecclesiastes
man’s expenses have a way of keeping pace with his income, so that he 
is never able to save any money.
“The working man does not earn much, but his sleep is pleasant whether 
he eats little or much. But the full stomach of the rich man does not allow 
him to sleep” (5:12). If you eat a lot of rich food at night, you won’t be able 
to sleep properly. Simple food leads to a healthier life.
Chapter 6:1, 2: “There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it 
is prevalent among men. A man to whom God has given riches and wealth 
and honour so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires; yet God 
has not empowered him to eat from them.” Here is a man who has made 
a lot of money, but he loses his health in the pursuit of wealth and then 
is forbidden by the doctors to eat many things. Many people nowadays 
spend the first half of their working life ruining their health and accumu-
lating wealth, and then spend the rest of their life spending that wealth 
to regain their health! What folly! They work hard and ruin their health, 
destroy themselves to accumulate money and then die. 
Give God the best years of your life and the best part of each day. That 
is the wisest way to live.
How to Live in this World
Chapters 7 to 9 have a lot of good, practical advice on how to live in the 
world. 
“A good name is better than a good ointment and the day of one’s death 
is better than the day of one’s birth” (Ecclesiastes 7:1). That is true only 
if you have spent your life living for God and for eternity’s values – not 
otherwise.
“Patience of spirit is better than pride of spirit” (7:8). The patient man is 
a far better human being than the proud man.
“Do  not  say,  ‘Why  is  it  that  the  former  days  were  better  than  these?’  
For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this” (7:10). For a disciple of 
Jesus, the future is always going to be better than the past. So we should 
not look back – ever.
In Chapter  7:16,  17,  we  have  one  of  those  foolish  bits  of  advice  that  
human wisdom offers: “Don’t be too righteous and don’t be too wicked, for 
you will only destroy yourself.” Worldly people will say that it is impossible 
to live in this world without compromising a little bit on righteousness. 
So they justify giving a small bribe here and telling a little lie there. That, 
they say, is the only way to survive! The true Christian, of course, rejects 
this  suggestion.  Another  way  to  look  at  this  verse  would  be  to  read  it  
as: “Don’t try to be super-righteous or super-spiritual” – that is by going 
beyond the requirements of God’s Word.
In Chapter  7:28,  Solomon  says,  “I  have  found  one  wise  man  among  
a  thousand  men.  But  I  haven’t  found  a  wise  woman among  a  thou-
sand  women.”  Does  that  mean  that  men  are  wiser  than  women?  No.  

Worldly Wisdom Exemplified                                                                                                                 333
Ecclesiastes
God created men and women with equal powers and equal ability to be 
spiritual. Solomon is referring here, however, to the 1000 women he had 
in his harem – 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings 11:3). Knowing 
the flirtatious women he had in his harem, it is not surprising that he 
didn’t find wisdom among any of them. But there are many, many godly 
women who are wiser than men.
“A  man’s  wisdom  illumines  him  and  causes  his  serious  face  to  beam  
with joy” (8:1). The more wisdom we have, the more our faces will radiate 
the joy of the Lord. A grumpy, miserable look is one mark of a foolish man 
who has no wisdom. Jesus was never grumpy or sour. Neither should His 
disciples be.
“Because punishment against an evil deed is not executed quickly, there-
fore the hearts of men are given fully to do evil” (8:11). If God had meted 
out punishment as soon as anyone sinned in any way, men would have 
stopped sinning all over the world. But judgement-day is coming. “Even 
if a sinner does evil a hundred times and extends his life, I know it will go 
well only for those who fear God openly” (8:12).
Chapter 8:17 says that there are many things that God does, that we 
cannot fully understand or explain with our limited human wisdom.
Chapter  9:8  is  a  beautiful  verse  that  we  could  apply  to  our  life  and  
ministry: “Let your clothes be white all the time, and let not oil be lacking 
on  your  head.”  That  means  that  we  should  keep  our  conscience  clean  
and our hearts pure always. Secondly, we should seek to live under the 
anointing of the Holy Spirit at all times.
Chapter 9:14–18 tells the story of a small city that was delivered from 
the enemy by a simple wise man. Yet no one remembered that wise man. 
“Wisdom is better than weapons of war” (9:18). We must win people by 
kindness and not by brutality. There is a children’s fable about the sun 
and the wind having a competition to find out who was stronger. A man 
was  walking  down  the  street  and  they  decided  that  whoever  could  get  
his coat off him would be the stronger one. The wind went first and blew 
hard  upon  the  man.  But  the  more  the  wind  blew,  the  tighter  the  man  
clutched his coat to his body. Then it was the sun’s turn. It just made 
it  hotter  and  hotter.  Very  soon,  the  man  took  off  his  coat.  Wisdom  is  
better than strength. God brings us to repentance through His kindness 
(Romans 2:4).
Worldly Wisdom Exemplified
“Dead flies make a perfumer’s ointment to stink. So a little foolishness is 
weightier than much wisdom and honour” (10:1). One small act of foolish-
ness can ruin your entire testimony for wisdom, just like one lizard falling 
into a tasty chicken curry would ruin the whole dish of curry. That’s why 
we  all  need  to  humbly  ask  God  to  preserve  us  from  foolish  words  and  
actions.

334 Through the Bible: The Vanity of Worldliness
Ecclesiastes
Chapter 10:4 is beautifully paraphrased in the Living Bible as: “If the 
boss is angry with you, don’t quit.”
“He who digs a pit (for others) may fall into it” (10:8). God treats us as 
we treat others.
“A  serpent  may  bite  him  who  breaks  through  a  wall”  (10:8).  God  has  
drawn  boundaries  around  all  of  us  and  we  must  stay  within  them.  If  
we go outside them, Satan, that old serpent, can bite us. That is what 
happened to Adam and Eve in Eden and to King Saul and King Uzziah 
(Genesis 3; 1 Samuel 13:9; 2 Chronicles 26:16).
“If the axe is dull and he does not sharpen its edge, he must exert more 
strength. Wisdom has the advantage of giving success” (10:10). You can 
finish the job quicker if you first sharpen your axe. We must keep our 
spiritual edge sharp by keeping our conscience clear always. The sword 
of  the  Spirit  must  also  be  sharp  in  our  hand,  because  we  know  God’s  
Word well. Preaching with a poor knowledge of God’s Word is like using 
a  blunt  sword  in  war.  The  enemy  is  not  defeated.  Jesus  often  solved  
problems with a single sentence like, “He who is without sin among you, 
let him cast the first stone”. His replies to Satan’s temptations also came 
from a sharp sword: “Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word 
that proceeds from the mouth of God”, etc. 
Again we see a mixture of worldly wisdom here: “Money is the answer 
to  everything.”  (10:19).  That  is  exactly  what  the  man  of  the  world  says  
and that is why he pursues after money with all his heart. We who believe 
that God is the answer to every problem should be pursuing after God 
with all our hearts.
Chapter 10:20 is an exhortation not to gossip in our bedrooms.
“Cast your bread on the surface of the waters and you will find it after 
many  days”  (11:1).  We  must  do  good  to  others  whenever we  have  an  
opportunity – and we will reap what we sow. In the measure in which we 
give, we will receive.
“Whether  a  tree  falls  toward  the  south  or  the  north,  wherever  the  tree  
falls, there it lies” (11:3). Once a person dies, his eternal fate is settled.
“He who watches the wind will not sow and he who looks at the clouds 
will not reap” (11:4). We must not wait for perfect conditions to serve 
the  Lord.  We  must  be  ready  to  share  the  gospel  with  others  and  to  
serve the Lord at all times – when it is convenient for us and when it is 
not (2 Timothy 4:2).
“Just as you don’t know the path of the wind, so you do not know the 
activity of God” (11:5). Our mind is like a little cup that cannot contain 
the ocean of God’s wisdom. So we do not have an explanation for many 
things on this earth. Neither can we fully know how God works in every 
area. Jesus said that “the wind blows where it wishes” (John 3:5). Even 
so, we cannot explain all the workings of the Holy Spirit.

Ecclesiastes
Chapter 11:9–12:7 is a warning to young men that if they “follow the 
impulses of their heart and the desires of their eyes, God will bring them 
to judgment for all these things”. They must live each day therefore recog-
nising that they are accountable to God for all that we do with our bodies. 
Since  “life is fleeting”  they  should  put  away  anger  and  everything  that  
will cause eternal grief, and remember their Creator while they are still 
young, for it will be more difficult to turn to God in later years. Old age 
is described in 12:2–7.
Chapter 12:9–11 are three excellent verses that describe many of the 
qualities of a good preacher. A good preacher is one who not only knows 
God’s Word but who also knows how to apply it wisely in daily life situa-
tions. He will meditate on God’s Word, search through it to find all that it 
says on any subject, and arrange the results of his study. He will then be 
careful to present the truth accurately and also in a pleasant and inter-
esting way. His words will be words given to him by the Chief Shepherd 
and  they  will  nail  down  important  truths  in  people’s  minds  and  spur  
them to action.
We are told in Chapter 12:12 that excessive study of books can become 
wearisome. 
In  conclusion  we  are  exhorted  to  “fear  God  and  keep  His  command-
ments, for God will bring every act to judgment” (12:13, 14). The religious 
person obeys God only because he is afraid of judgement. In contrast, the 
spiritual person obeys God out of love and gratitude (John 14:15).
So the book of Ecclesiastes shows us that even without knowing God, 
people can still know how to do right in many areas. But their motive 
for doing right will always be selfish and they will be self-righteous 
Pharisees  who  judge  everyone  else.  They  may  do  many  good  things,  
but as we said earlier, one lizard (of spiritual pride) spoils their whole 
dish of curry.



SONG OF SOLOMON
The Bridegroom and the Bride
T
he Song of Solomon is also called “Song of Songs” and “Canticles”. 
The word “Lord – YHVH” occurs only once in this book (‘flame of 
the Lord’ – 8:6 - Hebrew).
Some Christians are embarrassed to read this book, because they have 
a wrong understanding of the sexual part of married life. This is because 
their  understanding  of  sex  has  come  from  the  cinema  and  the  world’s  
media. 
There  are  two  lessons  that  God  clearly  wants  us  to  learn  from  this  
book. 
1. That the sexual relationship in marriage is very good and very essential. 
2. That our relationship with Christ must be as intimate and warm as 
that of a loving bride with her Bridegroom. 
It  was  God  Who  created  the  sexual  function  in  Adam  and  Eve.  After  
creating their sexual organs, He told Adam and Eve to multiply – obvi-
ously through their sexual union (Genesis 1:28). God then looked at all 
that  He  had  created  (including  the  sexual  function)  and  pronounced  
everything as “Very good” (Genesis 1:31). If God Himself has pronounced 
sex between a husband and wife as “Very Good” on the first page of the 
Bible, then there is no need for us to hear anyone else’s opinion on this 
subject. It is very good.
But what we learn in Song of Solomon is that an unselfish love for each 
other  is  what  makes  the  sexual  act  pure  and  holy  in  marriage.  Sexual  
union without love is fleshly.
It  was  God  Who  created  the  sexual  function.  But  like  many  other  
things, Satan has perverted it by getting people to indulge in sex outside 
of marriage. 

338 Through the Bible: The Bridegroom and the Bride
Song of Solomon
Consider the atom. Like sex, that too was created by God. But man has 
used it for good and for evil purposes. When an atom is split, the energy 
produced thereby can be used to provide electricity for a whole city. Or it 
can be used to make a bomb that destroys thousands of people! 
Or consider dynamite. That can be used to blast a rock to build a foun-
dation for a house, or it can be used to make a bomb that kills people. 
“Sex” too can be used in a good or an evil way.
God  gave  Peter  a  vision  once  of  a  sheet  coming  down  from  heaven  
with clean and unclean animals in it and He asked Peter to kill and 
eat.  When  Peter  refused  to  eat,  because  it  would  have  violated  the  
Jewish ceremonial laws, God told him, “What God has cleansed, don’t 
consider as unholy” (Acts 10:15). We could use the same words about 
“sex” as well: What God calls “holy”, don’t call unclean. When the world 
uses  “sex”  wrongly,  then,  of  course,  it  is  both  unclean  and  evil.  But  
within the bonds of marriage, it is both holy and pure. It helps to bind 
husband and wife together in a holy bond.
I would encourage every husband and wife therefore to read Song of 
Solomon to each other. It will teach you to appreciate one another and 
not to take each other for granted. In our Indian culture unfortunately, 
husbands and wives do not appreciate one another; and in most cases, 
their sexual union is mechanical. 
This  book  will  also  teach  you  the  importance  of  communication  in  
marriage – of speaking to each other in a kind and loving way. This book 
is  also  a  very  realistic book. It  shows  how  there  are  ups  and  downs  in 
every marriage, and how at times there may be no feelings of love, and 
how true love comes out triumphant through every crisis. It also teaches 
how a dying marriage can be revived. So, this is a very down-to-earth, 
realistic and practical book on God’s wonderful gift of “love and sex” in 
marriage.
The Song  of  Solomon  is  also  a  picture  of  Christ  and  the  church.  All  
believers – both married and unmarried can study the book in this way 
and deepen their relationship with the Lord. 
Song of Solomon was the first book of the Bible that I studied in detail, 
immediately after I was baptised – in 1961. I was working on a ship that 
was out at sea frequently and in remote uninhabited areas of the Indian 
coastline. As a result, I had no contact with believers for weeks on end at 
times. The study of this book at that time deepened my devotion to the Lord 
Jesus as the Bridegroom of my soul. I discovered that I was very precious 
to Him. And He became very precious to me. I learnt to rest in His infinite 
love for me, to trust Him fully, to lean upon Him totally, and to love Him 
with all my heart and soul. My relationship with the Lord has deepened 
through all these many years since then, and this is what has preserved 
me from cooling off and falling away. Therefore I value this book greatly.

  339
Song of Solomon
In Revelation 14:3 we read that those who followed the Lamb sang a 
new song that no one else could learn. The small group of 144,000 people 
there  symbolises  the  bride  of  Christ  who  followed  in  her  Bridegroom’s  
footsteps during her earthly life. The bride alone could learn this song, 
for it is a song about her Beloved. Song of Solomon pictures this song of 
the bride. You cannot learn that song by studying the Bible, but only by 
following Jesus. The bride learnt this song when she was on earth. The 
Lord takes us through many trials in our earthly life and it is in those 
trials that we learn this song.
Ministry  should  never  be the  primary  focus  of  our  lives.  Love  for  the  
Lord  must  always  be  primary.  After  serving  the  Lord  full  time  for 
50 years, I want to say this, that my devotion to my Lord is the basis 
of all my ministry. Our ministry will have no value at all in God’s eyes, 
if our devotion to Christ were to decrease. We see this from the Lord’s 
rebuke to the messenger in the church at Ephesus, when He told him, 
“I  know  your  works  and  your  toil  and  your  perseverance.  But  I  still  
have something against you: You don’t love Me as you did at first” 
(Revelation  2:2–4  -  Living).  This  was  such  a  serious  failure  that  the  
Lord threatened to take away His recognition of the church in Ephesus 
altogether (Revelation 2:5).
A personal, loving, devoted relationship with Christ is the spring from 
which  all  true service  for  the  Lord  flows  –  whether  it  be  evangelism, 
church-planting, Bible-teaching, social work or whatever. We must first 
learn “The Song of the Bridegroom and the Bride” – the song that our Lord 
sings to us, and that we sing back to Him.
Proverbs speaks of Divine wisdom and Ecclesiastes of human wisdom. 
But Song  of  Solomon  speaks  of  Divine  love. Many  seek  after  Bible-
knowledge.  But  the  Lord  seeks  for  those  who  will  love  Him.  Only  then  
will our Bible knowledge be of value.
In Song of Solomon, we see a growth in the love of the bride. 
In the first chapter we see the beginnings of love. But this is more akin 
to infatuation.  When  young  people  say  that  they  are  “in  love  with  each  
other”, they are actually only “infatuated” with each other. 
True  love  is  selfless in  its  motivation,  whereas  infatuation  is  selfish. 
The purest expression of love that we see in this world, is not that between 
a man and a woman – as portrayed on the cinema screen, or described 
in  romantic  novels.  It  is  seen  in  the  love  of  a  mother  for  her  helpless  
child. A mother will sacrifice everything for that child of hers. We can see 
her love for her child especially when it is sick. Young men and women, 
however,  who  say  they  have  “fallen  in  love” do not sacrifice themselves 
selflessly for each other, year after year, like a mother does for her child. 
Their infatuation with each other lasts only as long as things go accord-
ing  to  their  own  wishes.  But  a  true  mother’s  love  is  not  like  that.  It  is  

340 Through the Bible: The Bridegroom and the Bride
Song of Solomon
totally  independent  of  any  response  from  her  child.  The  child  may  be  
handicapped or sick, but the mother will keep on loving it – endlessly. 
This is the closest love to the love of God that we can see on this earth. 
And that is why God Himself compares His love to the love of a mother 
for her newborn child (Isaiah 49:15). When a husband and wife can love 
each other like that, then only have they really understood love. But it 
takes time for love to grow to such maturity. 
In the early stages of a marriage, there is much selfishness in husband-
wife  relationships.  The  husband  wants  something  from  his  wife  that  
will  satisfy  him,  and  the  wife  wants  something  from  her  husband  
that  will  satisfy  her.  The  man  usually  wants  sexual gratification and 
someone to serve him, while the woman usually wants security and a 
comfortable life. Both are selfish. But such infatuation can grow into 
love, where there is a selfless commitment to each other.
Our relationship with the Lord may also begin in the same selfish way. 
We may come to God initially because we want something for ourselves 
– perhaps salvation from hell, or healing, or money, or the solution to a 
problem, or an anointed ministry. All such desires are self-centred. But 
when love matures, we say, “Lord, I am not seeking for health, wealth or 
even for a ministry. I have You, and that’s all I want. I want You to get the 
most out of my one earthly life.” Then we won’t be thinking of what we 
can get out of the Lord, but of what the Lord can get out of us. That is 
mature love.
Jesus’  love  for  us  was  like  that.  When  He  came  to  earth  He  was  not 
thinking,  “What  can  I  get  from  man  for  Myself?”  No.  His  thought  was,  
“What can I give to man?” That is how Divine love always thinks. And that 
is the mature love that we finally come to in the last chapter – Chapter 8 
– of this book. Untested love matures finally into true Divine love. 
The psalmist said, “Whom have I in heaven but Thee? There is nothing 
on earth I desire beside Thee” (Psalms 73:25). That is the expression of 
one who has matured in love for his Lord. He no longer cares for health 
or wealth or anything else on earth. The Lord alone is enough for Him. 
Beginning of Love
Chapter1:1: The first thing we notice here is that this is Solomon’s song 
– the Bridegroom’s song – primarily, and not the bride’s. That means it 
is our Lord’s song to us primarily, and not our song to Him. “We love Him 
because He first loved us” (1 John 4:19). We did not love Him first. He 
loved us first. It is only because He sang this song to us first, that we can 
sing a song to Him now. Never ever begin by thinking of your love for the 
Lord. Our starting point must always be His love for us. Then we won’t go 
wrong. And we won’t ever get discouraged or condemn ourselves!

Beginning of Love                                                                                                                                     341
Song of Solomon
The first part here talks about “falling in love” with the Lord. The man’s 
name is not mentioned here. That is assumed, because there is only one 
person in the whole world for the bride – and that is her Beloved! The bride 
is taken up with her Bridegroom alone and says, “Your love is better than 
all the wine on the earth. How pleasing is your name!” (verse 3). The Bride-
groom is better than all the pleasures (wine) that the world can offer.
She then goes on to say, “Draw me and we will run after you” (verse 4). 
Note that carefully. Love does not push, it draws. There is a vast differ-
ence between pushing and drawing. Satan pushes us, but God draws us 
to Himself. Jesus said, “If I be lifted up I will draw all men to Myself” (John 
12:32). He seeks to draw us just like a magnet draws iron filings to itself. 
The Lord will never push anyone. As the Good Shepherd, He goes ahead 
of us and draws us to follow Him. If at any point, we don’t wish to go any 
further, He won’t force us to. This is one of the most wonderful things 
about  our  Lord.  And  that  is  how  we  can  distinguish  His  leading  from  
the feverish promptings of Satan. This is also how we can distinguish a 
godly leader from a cult-leader. Godly men go ahead of us and invite us to 
follow them – as Paul did (1 Corinthians 11:1). Cult-leaders, however, are 
like dictators and force people to go along the path they dictate through 
their preaching and their advice. What wonderful lessons we can learn 
from this book that can preserve us even from following false shepherds.
In a family, a husband must draw his wife forward by going ahead of 
her as an example, and not by pushing her saying, “Do this now”. Do 
you find some area in which your wife needs to improve? Then be a 
good example to her by going ahead of her in that area – and allow her 
to follow you at her own pace and in her own time. Don’t ever force her. 
That is the Divine way. This principle applies also to all our relation-
ships in the church.
The bride calls her Beloved, “My king” (1:4). We have to know Jesus as 
our King before we can know Him as our Bridegroom. Many Christians 
never enter into this love-relationship with the Lord, because they do not 
know Him as Lord and King over all their lives. Some area in their lives 
still remains unyielded.
We read here also about “the daughters of Jerusalem” or “the women 
of Jerusalem” (1:5). This phrase refers to halfhearted believers, who do 
not love the Lord with all their hearts. They are the ones who are taken 
up  with  their  “Christian”  ministry  –  preaching,  teaching,  Bible  studies  
etc. – and not with personal devotion to Jesus. They don’t live in sin. But 
they do not love the Lord fervently either. The Lord is looking for those 
who have the heart of a bride, who are devoted to Him and whose service 
comes out of that heart of love. 
The bride told these women, “I am black but lovely”. What she meant 
was that although she was unattractive, yet her Bridegroom had chosen 

342 Through the Bible: The Bridegroom and the Bride
Song of Solomon
her.  The  Bible  says  that  God  has  chosen  the  poor  and  the  foolish  of  
the  world  primarily,  and  not  the  mighty  and  the  noble  and  the  clever  
(1 Corinthians 1:26–29). Some of us may perhaps feel like that, “I am not 
capable like other people. I am not intelligent. I can’t speak like others. 
I am so limited in my abilities.” Yet the Lord has chosen us!
There were prettier women in Jerusalem. But the Bridegroom chose this 
black  one.  Jesus  does  that,  because  He  looks  for  qualities  of  the  heart,  
and not for appearance, gift or capabilities. We must learn something here. 
All our natural abilities, family background and accomplishments are not 
really of any value to God. It is a heart of devotion that He looks for. This is 
what the Lord seeks when He looks for someone to be His servant.
The bride knew that even though she was dark, she was beautiful in 
her Bridegroom’s eyes. Many married women suffer because they don’t 
feel that their husbands really accept them and rejoice in them. I rejoice 
in my wife. I hope all of you husbands also will do that. It’s very import-
ant that your wife knows that you rejoice in her. In the same way, many 
believers  don’t  realise  that  the  Lord  rejoices  in  them.  Zephaniah  3:17  
says, “The Lord your God in your midst is mighty. He shouts over you with 
shouts of joy.” God is very happy to have us as His children. Do you know 
that? We may be ugly in man’s eyes, but we are beautiful in God’s eyes. 
It is very important that we understand this clearly.
“Don’t  look  down  on  me,  you  beautiful,  fair,  city  girls”  (1:6).  She  was  
an uncultured, village girl and the refined city-girls of Jerusalem looked 
down on her. But the Bridegroom ignored all the smart, charming, city 
girls  and  chose  that  village  girl.  That  is  how  the  Lord  has  chosen  us.  
Praise the Lord for that! Are other believers looking down on you? Don’t 
get discouraged, for you are precious to your Lord! Ezekiel 16 is a beau-
tiful chapter that describes how God picked us up when we were filthy 
and rotten and neglected, lying helpless by the roadside.
“They made me the keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have 
not  kept”  (1:6).  The  other  vineyards  refer  to  our  ministry.  My vineyard 
is my life and my walk with God. This is a common mistake that many 
preachers  have  made.  They  are  busy  in  the  Lord’s  work,  but  have  not  
kept their own vineyard. They are occupied with many activities but have 
neglected their personal walk with the Lord. They are always thinking in 
terms of statistics, the number of people they have brought to the Lord, 
the number of places visited etc. Song of Solomon warns us against this 
danger right at the very beginning. Paul told Timothy “Take heed to your-
self and to your teaching. Thus you will save yourself and those who hear 
you” (1 Timothy 4:16).
We notice that there were two things that the bride looked for: “Where 
are you feeding your flock, and where do you make them rest?” (1:7). 
These are the two things we need from the Lord too: food and rest.

Growth of Love                                                                                                                                          343
Song of Solomon
The Bridegroom then praises her saying, “How beautiful you are!” We 
need to hear such words from the Lord – that assure us that the Lord 
really delights in us. Wives also need to hear such expressions of appre-
ciation from their husbands. A wife looks for assurances of love that give 
her security in a marriage just as much as a husband looks for sex. Both 
of these are of prime importance to have a happy marriage. A wife must 
satisfy her husband’s sexual needs. And a husband must give his wife 
the assurance of love that she looks for.
We  can  talk  about  such  matters  unashamedly  because  these  are  
spiritual  matters.  Unfortunately,  most  preachers  never  talk  about  sex  
from  the  pulpit,  and  so  the  only  understanding  that  many  Christian  
young people have of this vital subject is what they get from the world. 
They only hear the devil’s version. The Bible speaks openly and plainly 
about sex and tells us what God’s standards are on this matter.
So there, we see the beginning of love – delighting in the fact that God 
has accepted us and that we are therefore so blessed. 
Growth of Love
In Chapters 2 to 6, we read about the growth of love that finally culmi-
nates in Chapter 8. There are ups and downs in the love of the bride and 
at times no feelings of love at all. 
In 2:1, the bride says, “I am just a rose in Sharon. I am just a lily in the 
valley.” Those expressions (by the way), do not refer to the Bridegroom, 
but to the bride. Many songs refer to Jesus as the “rose of Sharon” and the 
“lily of the valley”. But those are un-Scriptural expressions. It is the bride 
saying to the Bridegroom, “I am just an ordinary rose in Sharon. There 
are thousands of roses in Sharon and I am just one of them. I am just 
an ordinary lily in the valley.” But the Bridegroom says, “Yes, that may 
be true. But you’re a lily in the midst of thorns” (2:2). Those fair, attractive 
women in Jerusalem were good looking on the outside, but they were like 
“pigs with golden rings in their noses” (Proverbs 11:22) – attractive, but 
without devotion to the Lord. So the Bridegroom likens them to thorns. 
In the midst of those thorns, his bride was like a lily. 
The bride goes on to say, “He has brought me to his banqueting hall so 
that everyone can see how much he loves me” (2:4). The father of the 
prodigal son brought his son to the table. Jesus sat with His disciples 
around a table. The table speaks of fellowship. At a table, we are not 
engaged in ministry for our Lord, but in fellowship with our Lord. We 
dine  with  Him  (See  Revelation  3:20).  It  is  only  later  that  we  see  the  
Bridegroom and the bride going to the fields. Don’t ever attempt going 
to the fields for ministry before sitting at the table and fellowshipping 
with the Lord first. Adam’s first day was a day of rest and fellowship 

344 Through the Bible: The Bridegroom and the Bride
Song of Solomon
with God (for Adam was created on the sixth day). Only after that did 
God send him to work in the garden.
The bride says, “Feed me with your love. I am lovesick.” That means, 
“Lord Jesus, You are everything to me. Let me rejoice and be secure in 
your love. The world is no longer attractive to me.” There are beautiful 
expressions of devotion in this song which can deepen our relationship 
with the Lord and detach us from the world.
“Promise me, O women of Jerusalem, not to awaken love until the time 
is  right”  (2:7).  This  is  a  verse  that  all  young  men  and  women  should  
keep in mind in their relationships. Don’t stir up (awaken) love until the 
right  time.  Don’t  let  your  emotions  be  awakened  in  loving  someone  of  
the opposite sex until God’s time. Be careful. Keep those emotions under 
control if you want to grow up as a godly young man/woman. You will 
certainly have feelings. But don’t let those feelings control you and lead 
you in directions that you will regret later.
Whenever the devil sees some young man or woman becoming zealous 
for God, he keeps his eye on him/her, for he senses that such a person can 
grow up to be a threat to his kingdom on earth. And he will seek to destroy 
him/her, often by getting them married to a carnal, worldly person. India 
has lost many godly homes because godly young men did not get married 
to godly women. So don’t stir up love until the time is right.
Infatuation cannot wait. Infatuated young men are usually crazy after 
sex. Their attitude is, “I must have sex now. I can’t wait until I get married.” 
But  a  godly  man  can wait,  for  the  fruit  of  the  Spirit  is  self-control.  Be  
careful whenever you find your feelings aroused towards someone. Don’t 
awaken love until the time is right – and the right time is after you are 
engaged to be married. The reason why many young men cannot study 
the Scriptures seriously is that they are daydreaming about some girl or 
the other as a possible life-partner, most of the time. They may not be 
thinking dirty, sexual thoughts, but they cannot concentrate on hearing 
the Lord’s voice.
“My beloved is coming, climbing on the mountains, leaping on the hills” 
(2:8). This refers to the eagerness with which our Lord comes to us and 
also to the return of our Lord to earth. The Bridegroom then says, “My 
darling, come along with me.” He invites His bride now to come away from 
the world. “The winter is past...the flowers have appeared” (2:11, 12). The 
approach of summer is likened to the nearness of the Lord’s return to 
earth (Matthew 24:32, 33). We are now living in that time when summer 
is near. The Bridegroom then says endearingly, “O my dove in the clefts 
of the rock, let me see your form, let me hear your voice, for your voice is 
sweet and your form is lovely” (2:14). The Rock here is Christ in whose 
side  we  are  hidden.  These  words  show  the  intensity  of  the  Lord’s  love,  
affection and care for us. If we believed this, it would remove all insecu-
rity and fear from us totally.

Growth of Love                                                                                                                                          345
Song of Solomon
Then  the  Bridegroom  says,  “Catch  the  little  foxes  quickly  before  they  
ruin the vineyard of your love while the great vines are in blossom” (2:15). 
This is a word that we need to hear constantly. It is easy to see the big 
foxes  (obvious  sins)  that  ruin  our  vineyard.  But  there  are  baby  foxes  
that creep into our vineyard and eat up the grapes – and these are more 
dangerous, because they are less noticeable. 
In married life too, it’s not the big dangers that we need to watch out 
for,  like  the  husband  hitting  his  wife.  Most  of  us  may  never  do  such  
things. The little foxes that destroy a marriage are usually the little irri-
tations, and the raised voice. Catch those little foxes and kill them before 
they ruin your marriage. Your marriage is like a vineyard. Preserve it like 
any wise farmer would. 
Your relationship with the Lord is also like a vineyard. It’s not the big 
sins  like  adultery  and  murder  that  drive  most  believers  away  from  the  
Lord. It’s the little things – impure thoughts, love of money, an unforgiv-
ing attitude, etc. – that come between us and the Lord and ruin our walk 
with Him. So let us be diligent to catch the little foxes.
In 3:1, the bride speaks about a time when she lost the sense of her 
Bridegroom’s  presence.  One  night  as  she  lay  on  her  bed,  she  yearned  
deeply for her Lord. But He didn’t come. So she decided to get up and go 
into the city and search for Him (3:1, 2). Here we see the bride seeking for 
feelings of the presence of her Bridegroom. “And her search was in vain. 
The watchmen in 3:3 refer to elders of churches and preachers who may 
have the right doctrines but who don’t know God – like the preachers in 
the book of Job. They don’t have the devotion to Christ that this young 
bride  who  loves  the  Lord  has.  She  went  to  these  watchmen  and  asked  
them, “Have you seen him whom I love so much?” But they couldn’t guide 
her. How can an elder who is not devoted to the Lord himself, guide one 
who is yearning for the Lord, like the bride here? 
It’s a sad testimony to the backslidden state of Christendom that it is 
so difficult to find elder brothers today who can guide young people 
into  a  life  of  devotion  to  Christ.  There  are  many  who  can  teach  you  
Biblical truths and how to engage in evangelism – but not how to be 
devoted to Jesus Christ. It is not enough that an elder brother teaches 
his flock the Scriptures. He must lead them to be devoted  to  Christ. 
That is the mark of a good “watchman”.
Finally, the bride found her Beloved herself (3:4). This was my experi-
ence in my younger days too. I did not have godly elders who could lead 
me  to  a  life  of  devotion  to  Christ.  The  Holy  Spirit  led  me  into  that  life  
Himself. Some of you also may be living in places where you don’t have 
godly elder brothers to guide you. Seek the Lord wholeheartedly and the 
Spirit will be your Guide into such a life. “When I found Him Whom my 
soul loves, I held on to him and would not let Him go” (3:4).

346 Through the Bible: The Bridegroom and the Bride
Song of Solomon
We now come to Chapter 4. Up till now, it was the bride speaking most 
of the time. But now we hear a long appreciation of the bride from the 
Bridegroom.  One  mark  of  spiritual  growth  is  that  we  learn  to  listen  to  
the Lord more than to talk ourselves. The bride is maturing. And as she 
listens, she finds her Bridegroom expressing his admiration of her. He 
admires every part of her and then concludes by saying, “You are alto-
gether beautiful, my darling” (4:7).
Then he invites her saying, “Come with Me from Lebanon. Look down 
from the summit of Amana, from the summit of Senir and Hermon, from the 
dens of lions” (4:8). This is an invitation to live in the heavenlies. The Lord 
says, “Don’t look at things from a low, earthly standpoint. Come with Me 
to the heavenlies and look at everything from that standpoint. The things 
of earth will then become small, dim and worthless, as you look at them 
from there.” The Lord wants to lift us to a higher plane. True, there are 
lions there – demons, evil principalities and powers. But we will be with 
the  Lord  there  and  together  with  Him  we  will  overcome  all  those  evil  
powers. The bride is now being invited to spiritual warfare.
The Bridegroom calls the bride “a locked garden” (4:12) – an exclusive 
garden, exclusively for the Bridegroom. She doesn’t belong to anyone 
else. She belongs exclusively to her Lord. Is your relationship with the 
Lord like that? Can the Lord say to you, “You are My private garden, 
exclusively  Mine”?  There  are  many  things  out  in  the  world  that  can  
attract us like opportunities to make more money than we need, to get 
earthly power and fame and to earn a name for ourselves, etc. Such 
temptations can be compared to other men trying to seduce the bride. 
But the bride here is not attracted. She is taken up with her Beloved 
alone. She belongs to her Bridegroom exclusively.
Very few believers live in such a relationship with Christ and that is 
why they don’t know Him intimately and don’t understand His word. The 
secret of understanding the Bible is to have an intimate relationship with 
the Lord first of all – who better than He can explain to us what His Word 
means. Walk with Him like the early disciples did and long to hear Him 
speak to you. Then your eyes will be opened like theirs and your hearts 
will be set aflame like theirs. This is what I have discovered in the more 
than half a century that I have walked with my Lord. 
The bride then invites the north wind and the south wind to come and 
blow over her garden (4:16). The north wind is the cold wind of suffering, 
adversity and trials, and the south wind is the wind of blessing, encour-
agement,  prosperity  and  happiness.  It  doesn’t  matter  which  of  these  
winds  blow.  The  result  will  be  the  same  –  a  fragrance  wafted  abroad.  
Whether we have a comfortable easy life or have a life full of difficulties 
and trials, the grace of God can make the aroma of Christ to come forth

Song of Solomon
from us. Thanksgiving, praise and worship to God will come forth from 
our life, irrespective of our circumstances. 
“May my beloved come into his garden and eat its choice fruits” (4:16). 
Everything  that  is  produced  in  our  life  (our  garden)  is  for  the  Lord  –  
not  to  impress  other  people  with  how  spiritual  we  are.  When  you  give  
a testimony about your life, don’t try to show others what a wonderful 
person you are. Instead, let them see what a wonderful Saviour you have! 
Otherwise your fruit will be for men and not for the Lord. Here the bride 
says, “Everything in my garden is for my beloved alone.”
Did  God  use  you  to  bring  someone  to  Christ?  Don’t  rejoice  in  what  
you did. Rejoice with the angels that a sinner repented. He is the Lord’s 
convert not yours. If you made a sacrifice for the Lord, let no-one know 
about it. Why should we advertise our sacrifices? Does a wife who loves 
her husband deeply tell the world about the sacrifices she makes for 
him? There are so many loving secrets between a wife and a husband. 
There should be loving secrets between us and the Lord too. You may be 
spending time alone with the Lord. Good. But why should anyone else 
know about that? A wife who is in love with her husband will not want 
anyone to know about their times together. That was why Jesus told us 
to shut the door when we pray. Nobody should know about the times we 
spend with our Beloved.
But it is rare indeed to find Christians like this. Most of them are eager 
to let everyone know about their sacrifices and their service for the 
Lord – in a way that glorifies them! That is the clearest proof that they 
lack a love-relationship with the Lord. Song of Solomon is an important 
book for all such Christians. I am deeply thankful to the Lord that He 
led me to study this book first, when I began my Christian life. This 
love-relationship with the Lord should be the basis of all our service 
for the Lord. 
Paul says in 2 Corinthians 11:3, “I am afraid lest as the serpent deceived 
Eve by his craftiness, your minds should be led astray from the simplicity 
and purity of devotion to Christ.” When are we led astray? When we lose 
that simple devotion to Christ. You don’t have to steal, commit adultery, 
or tell lies, in order to be a backslider. If you have lost that simple devo-
tion to Christ, the devil has already led you astray.
The  Bridegroom  accepts  the  invitation  of  his  bride  to  come  into  her  
garden and eat, and says, “I have come into my garden” (5:1). He calls it 
His garden now. He came to collect the fruit. And after taking it Himself, 
He invites others also to come into the garden and eat with him. Our Lord 
makes our life a blessing to many others. 
The scene changes now and the bride now speaks of what happened 
one night. “I was asleep, but my heart was awake” (5:2). Suddenly she 
heard  the  voice  of  her  Beloved.  The  Lord  calls  us  suddenly  at  times.  

348 Through the Bible: The Bridegroom and the Bride
Song of Solomon
He  wants  us  to  be  alert  at  all  times  to  hear  His  voice.  We  read  in  the  
Old Testament that God would call Abraham suddenly at times saying, 
“Abraham, Abraham.” And Abraham would respond immediately saying, 
“Here I am” – even if it was in the middle of the night, when he was fast 
asleep.  In  Genesis  16:16  and 17:1,  we  read  that  after  thirteen years  of  
silence, God suddenly called Abraham one day. And Abraham responded 
at once! In the midst of his many other preoccupations, he was always 
alert to hear the Lord’s voice. The Lord called Samuel too in the middle of 
the night – and Samuel woke up and listened. That’s how we all must be.
But here we see that when the Bridegroom came in the middle of the 
night calling, “Open to me, my darling” (5:2), the bride was too lazy to 
dress up and open the door (5:3). She was concerned that her feet (that 
she had washed) would be soiled. He tried to unlatch the door himself 
(5:4). Then the bride changed her mind and opened the door, but found 
that her Beloved was gone. He went away because she did not respond 
at once, when He called her.
That can happen to us too. The Lord may say to us, “Now drop everything 
that you are doing. Stop reading that book. Stop that conversation. Get 
alone  with  Me  and  talk  to  Me.  Let’s  go  for  a  walk  together.”  And  we  
may respond saying, “Lord, just wait. I have something important to 
do. It will be finished in 15 minutes. Then I’ll come.” And 15 minutes 
later, when we have finished that important (?) work, we say, “Lord, I 
am ready now.” But we find that He is gone. We can’t find Him. That is 
the experience of many believers. The Lord tests us to see if He is more 
important to us than the conversation we are having with our friends, 
than the book we are reading, or the work we are doing, etc. He will 
test us to see if we are willing to drop everything and to listen to Him. 
Do you want to be an effective servant of God? Develop this habit of 
dropping everything when the Lord calls you, and of listening to Him. 
You will never regret it.
The Bridegroom had told His bride “I have been out in the night and am 
covered  with  dew”  (5:2  -  Living).  Because  Jesus  came  to  earth  to  seek  
and  save  the  lost,  He  walked  the  way  of  the  cross  (of  self-denial)  and  
suffered as He sought after lost sheep in the dark night of this world. He 
now invites His bride to walk the same way. But she is unwilling. 
But later on, she changed her mind and got up and decided to walk 
that way. But now she couldn’t find her Bridegroom. Then she went to 
the watchmen (the elders) again. She doesn’t seem to have learnt a lesson 
from her previous contacts with them, that they cannot help her. They 
know nothing about the way of the cross. This time they beat her up and 
hurt her (5:7). Those elders were worldly and legalistic and wounded her 
with their words. They couldn’t understand her fervent devotion to her 

Growth of Love                                                                                                                                          349
Song of Solomon
Lord. They may have told her words like this: “You have to be realistic. 
We  have  to  live  in  this  world  and  we  can’t  be  taken  up  with  being  so  
fanatically devoted to the Lord.” There are many preachers like that who 
do not know the Lord, who will criticise you saying that your only theme 
seems  to  be  “loving  the  Lord”  –  as  if  that  were  a  crime.  The  watchmen  
then  tore  off  her  veil  (shawl),  implying  that  she  did  not  need  to  be  so  
modestly dressed! They disgraced her publicly. 
After  that  experience,  the  bride  went  to  the  halfhearted  believers  
(women  of  Jerusalem)  and  told  them,  “If you find my beloved, tell him 
I am lovesick” (5:8). That was a waste of time, because those halfhearted 
ones could never help her find her Lord. They hadn’t seen His beauty and 
glory  like  she  had.  When  they  questioned  her,  she  went  into  a  raptur-
ous  expression  of  her  admiration  for  Him,  describing  exactly  why  she  
admired Him, and concluding with the words, “He is altogether lovely. He 
is my beloved and my friend” (5:16 - KJV).
Can you say that Jesus is not only your Saviour, but also your Friend? 
What about your earthly husband/wife? Is he/she also your best friend 
on earth? It should be so. Many husbands and wives say that they love 
one another, but they are not the best of friends with each other. Their 
best friends are found among others. That is unfortunate. 
Jesus is my closest and dearest Friend – closer than even my wife. But 
among those on earth, my wife is my closest and best friend – and she 
will be so throughout my life. This has made both my Christian life and 
my married life extremely happy.
Finally, the bride finds her Beloved in His garden and says, “I am my 
beloved’s  and  my  beloved  is  mine”  (6:2,  3).  This  is  different  from  2:16, 
where she had said, “My beloved is mine and I am his.” There is progress 
here.  In  the  initial  stages  of  love,  her  emphasis  was  on,  “My  Lord  is 
mine.” Now her emphasis has changed to, “I am my Lord’s.” When we are 
young and immature, we are more possessive and think more of the fact 
that the Lord belongs exclusively to us, and wonder what we can get from 
the Lord for ourselves. As we grow to maturity, we begin to think more 
of  being  surrendered  to  the  Lord  totally,  and  of  His getting  everything  
possible from us, in our one earthly life.
The Bridegroom then expresses His appreciation for his bride (6:4–10). 
He says that among all women, no-one is like His bride, His perfect one. 
I  choose  her  above  everybody  else.”  Every  husband  should  look  at  his  
wife like this: There are many attractive women in the world, but there is 
no-one like my wife. She is Number One in my eyes. This is what the Lord 
says about us. He appreciates us more than all the clever people, and the 
rich people, and the great people in the world.

350 Through the Bible: The Bridegroom and the Bride
Song of Solomon
In 6:10, He compares His bride to “an army with banners.” This bride 
was not a soft sissy. She was a strong warrior, ready to fight Satan and 
the hosts of hell. She also has a conscience that is “as pure as the sun”. In 
6:13 she is called a Shulamite, a woman of Shulam, meaning “a person of 
peace”. Shulam is from the Hebrew word “Shalom”, which means ‘peace’. 
Here is a bride who is constantly battling for the Lord, fighting the forces 
of darkness, as a soldier, but who is at the same time, at peace with all 
human beings! 
Mature Love
We now come to the mature stage of the love of the bride for her Bridegroom.
In 7:1–9a, we read how the Bridegroom admires his bride. We need to 
see clearly that despite all our weaknesses, our Lord actually admires us 
and appreciates us. Many believers live with constant self-condemnation, 
just because they cannot believe that the Lord admires them. And when 
the Bridegroom admires the bride’s lips, she is quick to respond saying 
that that is actually more true of His lips (7:9b)! This speaks of a high 
degree of intimacy between the two – the type of intimacy that we should 
have with our Lord.
In 7:10, the bride says, “I am my beloved’s and His desire is for me.” 
This is a still higher plane of love than even 6:3. Here the bride is not just 
saying that the Lord belongs to her, but that the Lord is pleased with her 
as well. It is one thing for the Lord to say, “I love you.” It is quite another, 
for the Lord to say, “I am pleased with you.” A husband may love his wife, 
but he may not be happy with the way she does things. The Lord may 
love you, but He may not be happy with many things in your life. Mature 
love seeks to please the Lord. 
Now  the  bride  becomes  a  co-worker  with  her  Bridegroom  and  says,  
“Come, my love. Let us go out into the fields” (7:11). The bride now shares 
the concern of her Bridegroom for a needy world where the fields are ripe 
for harvest. But don’t ever go to those fields all by yourself. Go there with 
your Beloved. Build a relationship with Him and then serve Him. He is the 
One Who know the best part of the field in which you can labour for Him. 
That  is  how  I  have  sought  to  serve  the  Lord  in  my  ministry.  I  have  
never wanted to go anywhere by myself. I have said, “Lord, you lead the 
way and I’ll come along with You. Let us go to the fields together. Tell me 
where  You  are  going.  And  if  You’re  not  going  somewhere,  I  don’t  want  
to  go  there  either.”  If  we  serve  the  Lord  in  fellowship  with  Him  and  in  
submission to Him, there won’t be any boastfulness in our lives, nor any 
comparison of our ministry with another’s.
The bride then shares her Bridegroom’s burden for His vineyards. She 
wants to rise up early and go with Him to see if there is fruit there (7:12). 
She doesn’t only sit at the banqueting table enjoying His love (as in 2:4). 
She does that but she does more now. She is also concerned to see how 

Mature Love                                                                                                                                              351
Song of Solomon
the young believers in the church are doing. She takes care of her own 
vineyard (unlike as in 1:6). But she also wants to see how the Lord’s work 
in  the  churches  is  developing.  She  wants  to  see  if  “the  blossoms  have  
opened” and whether “the pomegranates have bloomed” (7:12). And she 
tells her Beloved, “There I will give you my love.” In the midst of all her 
ministry she wants to walk with her Lord and express her love for Him. 
And everything she has is “saved up for her Beloved” (7:13).
Chapter  8  expresses  the  bride’s  longing  for  perfect  union  with  her  
Beloved one day – in heaven. “Who is this coming up from the desert of 
the earth, leaning on her Beloved?” (8:5) – refers to the day when the 
church will be caught up in the clouds to lean on her Beloved forever 
– just like John leaned on the breast of Jesus.
“Put me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm”, she requests 
(8:6).  She  never  wants  to  be  separated  from  her  Beloved  and  wants  a  
permanent  place  in  His  heart  and  on  His  arm  –  like  the  tattoos  that  
people wear on their arms.
8:6, 7 speak of love and jealousy together. True love is always jealous 
–  a  “godly  jealousy”  that  doesn’t  want  anyone  else  to  own  the  other  
(2  Corinthians  11:2).  “The  Lord  jealously  desires  our  spirit”  for  Himself  
alone (James 4:5). He is very particular that we should not love money 
and the world, but only Him. He is a jealous Husband Who wants you for 
Himself exclusively. Such jealous love is likened to the brightest flame 
there is – “the flame of YHVH” (the Hebrew word for ‘Lord’). This is the 
only place in this book where the word ‘Lord’ occurs (8:6).
Many floods cannot quench this love and many rivers cannot drown 
it (8:7). This was the love that our Lord manifested on the cross. When 
people poured their floods of hatred on Him, he prayed that the Father 
would forgive them.
The bride now expresses her concern for her younger sisters, who have 
not grown spiritually (8:8). One mark of maturity is to have a concern 
for  the  immature.  8:9 is  an  interesting  verse  that  tells  us  that  a  girl  
can be either like a wall or a door. A wall refers to girls who are modest 
and reserved, like God created all girls to be. A door, on the other hand, 
refers to girls who are free with men. An open door is always an invita-
tion to walk right in – and girls should not be like that. If a girl is like 
a wall, then God can use her to build the church (“a battlement”). But 
if a girl is like a door, then her father has to build “a barricade” around 
her, cutting off her contacts with men.
8:10 speaks of the spiritual maturity of the bride. In 8:12, she says that 
the primary part  of  the  fruit  of  her  vineyard  (1000  shekels  worth)  was  
reserved  for  her  Beloved  alone.  Only  20%  of  that  amount  (200  shekels  

352 Through the Bible: The Bridegroom and the Bride
Song of Solomon
worth) was for others. Her primary ministry was not to people but to the 
Lord. This is how all our service should be. The Lord must be first and all 
others second. We are to love God with all our heart, soul and strength 
first, and only then love others.
In 8:13, 14, she expresses her longing for her Beloved to come to her 
soon. This is higher than what she said in 2:17. There she was longing to 
be restored to fellowship with Him. Here she is longing for her final union 
with her Beloved at “the marriage of the Lamb” (Revelation 19:7). This is 
the ultimate height of glory.
And so this book ends as the Bible ends, with a cry from the bride to 
her Lord to come quickly.
“Come quickly, Lord Jesus. I am waiting for You.” 
What a beautiful song this is! I want to encourage all of you to live in 
the good of this song all your days – both in your married life and in your 
relationship with your Lord. 
Amen. May it be so.

ISAIAH
Prophecies of Judgement  
and Comfort
I
saiah is the first of 17 books in the prophetical  section  of  the  Old  
Testament (Isaiah to Malachi).
The book of Isaiah is divided into two parts. Isaiah did not divide his 
books into chapters. It was only a few centuries ago that someone divided 
the  Bible  into  chapters  and  verses  so  that  we  could  refer  to  the  Bible  
more easily. So there is nothing inspired about the chapter divisions.
But it is interesting nevertheless to note that Isaiah has 66 chapters 
–  just  like  the  Bible  has  66  books.  And  just  as  the  Old  Testament  has  
39   books, and the New Testament has 27 books, even so, the first section 
of Isaiah has 39 chapters and the second section has 27 chapters! And 
Isaiah’s first section deals with Old Testament prophecies, and his second 
section deals with New Testament prophecies.
The  most  important  chapter  in  the  first section  is  Chapter  6.  There  
Isaiah saw the Lord on His throne first, and only then was he commis-
sioned to serve Him. He saw God there as a holy God Who hated sin and 
Who had to judge it. If we are to serve God effectively, we too must see 
this truth clearly.
The  most  important  chapter  in  the  second section  is  Chapter  53. 
There  we  see  the  Lamb  that  was  led  before  the  shearers,  sheared  and  
slaughtered. 
These two truths about the throne and the Lamb are brought together 
in Revelation 5, where we see the Lamb in the midst of the throne. 
As a Man, Jesus lived on earth as a Servant of God and as a Servant 
of  all  people  before He  went  to  the  cross.  In  Isaiah too, we  see  Jesus  
as the Servant of Jehovah in the chapters in the second section before 
Chapter  53  (the  chapter  of  the  cross).  We  are  to  serve  God  and  man  as  
Jesus did.

354 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
Two  titles  of  God  occur  frequently  in  this  book:  ‘The  Lord  of  hosts  
(Jehovah Tsabaoth)’ occurs 62 times and ‘The Holy One of Israel’ occurs 
30 times. The first refers to God as the God of the armies of angels, Who 
sovereignly rules over all things in heaven and earth. The second empha-
sises His holiness. Both these truths are emphasised in this book.
Isaiah has more lengthy and clearer prophecies about Christ than any 
other  Old  Testament  book,  and  the  word  “salvation”  occurs  frequently  
in it.
Isaiah prophesied for about 50 years to the nation of Judah. Tradition 
tells us that he was finally “sawn  in  two”  (Hebrews  11:37).  He  suffered  
like the Messiah he prophesied about. He had hidden himself in a hollow 
log, to escape capture. But he was discovered, and they sawed the log in 
two and killed him. Isaiah was killed because he was a fearless prophet, 
who  spoke  God’s  truth  in  strong  words.  When  he  spoke  to  the  leaders  
in Jerusalem, he called them “rulers of Sodom” (Isaiah 1:10). Those were 
strong words – and I am not surprised that the leaders sawed him asunder!
A prophet is never popular – and that is why there are very few proph-
ets in the world today. Isaiah did not seek to please people or to impress 
them (as most preachers do today). He was a prophet who spoke what 
God wanted him to speak, even if people were offended, hurt, or upset 
by what he said. They rejected his word and even threatened to kill him. 
But that didn’t frighten him. He was faithful to his God. And the word he 
spoke to the people would judge them in the final day.
The very first verse of the book indicates that Isaiah was prophesy-
ing  primarily  concerning  the  southern  kingdom  of  Judah.  There  are,  
however, a number of references to Israel too. The northern kingdom of 
Israel had backslidden terribly and was soon to be taken captive by the 
Assyrians; and Isaiah was sent by God to save Judah from a similar fate. 
Prophecies of Judgement (Chapters 1 to 27)
Chapters 1 to 12 are prophecies of judgement against Judah. Chapters 
13 to 27 are prophecies of judgement against other nations.
In Chapter 1, Isaiah describes the backslidden condition of Judah. The 
northern kingdom of Israel had had prophets like Elijah and Elisha who 
had spoken God’s Word powerfully to the people. But Judah had never 
had anyone like that. Even the best of Judah’s kings – Rehoboam, Asa, 
Jehoshaphat, Joash and Uzziah – had started their reigns well, but had 
turned away from God towards the end of their reigns. Because Judah 
did not have godly leaders, the nation had sunk to a very low level. Isaiah 
was the first major prophet they had. As a result of his prophesying, at 
last, Judah got one good king – Hezekiah. It is amazing the effect a single 
prophet can have on a nation – or on a church today.
Whenever God sends a prophet to a church, He always has a good plan 
for that church. But most prophets are rejected and called heretics by the 

Prophecies of Judgement (Chapters 1 to 27)                                                                                       355
Isaiah
people. Most of the Israelites preferred to listen to the false prophets with 
their  messages  of  peace  and  prosperity.  Most  Christians  have  had  the  
same preference too. This was true of Isaiah’s day as well. True prophets 
have always clashed with false prophets. They did so 3000 years ago and 
they do so today as well.
“An  ox  knows  its  owner,  the  donkey  know  its  master’s  manger,  but  
Israel does not know” (1:3). Israel did not know her Master and Owner. 
Even animals knew better. What a tragedy when God’s people sink lower 
than animals.
Israel had not only abandoned the Lord, but despised Him as well (1:4). 
The Lord describes their condition thus: “From the sole of the foot even to 
the head there is nothing sound in it” (1:6). That is a perfect picture of the 
condition of sinful man too.
A paraphrase of 1:11–15 would read, “What is the use of all your prayer 
meetings? I am not interested in them. I hate your special meetings and 
your Bible-study meetings. I will not listen to you, because there is sin in 
your life.”
A lot of prayer meetings are a waste of time because those who pray do 
not have a clear conscience. There is unconfessed sin in their lives. When 
your conscience is clear, a prayer meeting can be very powerful. But if 
your conscience is not clear, it is actually better not to pray – for prayer 
becomes a waste of time, because God doesn’t listen to such prayers. In 
such cases it is better to go to sleep than to pray! 
The Lord told the Israelites to do good, to seek justice, to defend the 
orphans and to plead for the widows, to stop doing evil and to stop exploit-
ing the poor. And then He promised them that if they acknowledged their 
sin (this is always the first step), He would make their hearts “as white 
as  snow”  (1:18).  Jerusalem,  the  once-faithful  city  had  become  a  harlot 
(1:21). James used words similar to Isaiah’s, when writing to Christians 
in  his  day:  “You  adulteresses,  don’t  you  know  that  friendship  with  the  
world is hostility toward God” (James 4:4). James too was a prophet like 
Isaiah telling the church what it needed to hear. We need prophets like 
James and Isaiah in the church in India today, who will tell believers the 
truth – not in anger or in hatred, but with love and compassion.
In Chapter 2, Isaiah speaks about the day when the kingdom of God 
will be established on this earth and “the word of the Lord will go forth 
from Jerusalem, and He will judge between the nations” (2:1–4).
In that day, “the proud look of man will be abased and the Lord alone 
will be exalted” (2:11). God’s greatest conflict has always been with the 
proud. Pride is the very opposite of God’s nature and so God resists the 
proud 24 hours of every day – whether they be believers or unbelievers. 
Every proud person will be humbled – sooner or later. Pride sends more 
people to hell than any other sin. If you want to live a wise and useful 
life on earth, humble yourself before God constantly, and walk in humi-
lity towards your fellowmen at all times. Always remember that there is 

356 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
nothing that you have that you did not receive from God. So, be willing to 
be a nobody on earth at all times, so that Christ alone may be exalted in 
your life. And whenever God uses you in any way, be sure to keep your 
head in the dust and to give Him all the glory. The Lord will have a day of 
reckoning against everyone who is “proud, lofty and lifted up” (2:12). Look 
at the triple emphasis with which God describes the proud in that verse! 
In that day, the proud of the earth will call upon the rocks to hide them 
from the wrath of God (as we read also in Revelation 6:16).
Man  is  a  creature  “whose  breath  is  in  his  nostrils”  (2:22).  God  is  the  
One  Who  gives  man  his  breath  every  day.  So,  if  we  fear  God,  there  is  
no need for us to fear any man. Whenever you are tempted to fear man, 
remember  this  verse.  If  someone  is  planning  to  harm  you  in  any  way,  
remember that God can take away his breath in a moment. As a young 
man, I was shy and reserved by temperament and found myself nervous 
whenever I had to preach God’s word. Because I was not secure in God, 
I wanted to impress people with my preaching. Then the Lord spoke to 
me through this verse. I then began to look at the people in front of me 
as merely dust, with breath in their nostrils. The colour of their dust was 
different – some were made of brown dust, some of black dust, some of 
white  dust  and  some  of  yellow  dust!!  But  they  were  all  still  dust!  This  
revelation set me free from seeking to impress people. Thereafter I could 
love them and seek to help them instead of trying to impress them.
Chapter 3:10, 11 assures the righteous that it will finally go well with 
them and warns the wicked that things will finally go badly for them. 
Although this may not appear to be so immediately, it will be so finally. 
Chapter 3:12 speaks of the pathetic state of the people of Israel: They 
were going astray because their leaders were immature (“children”) and 
effeminate  (“women”).  This,  unfortunately,  is  true  of  much  of  today’s  
Christian leadership as well. Immature leaders are those who value the 
temporal  things  of  earth  more  than  the  things  of  eternity. Effeminate 
leaders are those who are not warriors for the Lord – just as women are 
not usually found on the battlefield but at home. Such leaders are not 
bold to fight for the truth or to rebuke sin in the church – especially when 
sin is found among the rich. If you are called to be a leader, determine 
that  you  will  always  live  for  the  things  of  eternity  and  be  ready  at  all  
times to fight the Lord’s battles.
In 3:14, the Lord says that He is “going to enter into judgment with the 
elders and princes of His people.” The prophets invariably began with a 
warning of judgement against the leaders – because it was the leaders who 
had first become corrupt and thus led the people astray. The Lord says, 
“The plunder of the poor is in your houses. What do you mean by grinding 
the face of the poor?” (3:15). Most preachers today ask people frequently 
to “give money for the Lord’s work”. They even pressurise people to give 
their tithes – and many poor people respond and sacrificially give these 
preachers  their  hard-earned  money.  But  what  do  these  preachers  do  

Prophecies of Judgement (Chapters 1 to 27)                                                                                       357
Isaiah
with it? Most of them use it to live in grand style themselves! This is what 
it means to “grind the faces of the poor”. If you are a preacher and you 
receive a gift of money for your personal use, make sure that you use it to 
live at a lower standard than the person who gave you the money. That 
was the principle by which Jesus used the money that He received. 
Most preachers today (like the false prophets of old) care more for the 
rich  people  in  their  congregations  than  for  the  poor.  They  speak  sweet  
words to the rich and hard words of rebuke to the poor. God has, however, 
“chosen the poor of the world rich in faith and to be heirs of His kingdom” 
(James 2:5). And so true prophets are always concerned for the poor. 
The  Lord  then  had  something  to  say  to  the  women in  Zion  –  not  to  
unconverted  women,  but  to  “the  daughters  of  Zion.”  All  young  sisters  
should  read  Isaiah  3:16–26  and  be  warned.  The  Lord  says  there  that  
He will judge the women “who mince along with noses in the air, tinkling 
the bracelets on their ankles, and with wanton eyes that rove among the 
crowds  to  catch  the  glances  of  the  men.  The  Lord  will  strip  away  their  
ornaments, necklaces, bracelets, veils of shimmering gauze, ankle chains, 
headbands,  earrings  and  other  rings,  jewels,  party  clothes,  negligees,  
capes and ornate combs, their purses (handbags), and the mirrors (in their 
handbags), their lovely lingerie and beautiful dresses” (Living Bible).
Does  the  Lord  observe  such  minute  details  in  a  woman’s  attire?  He  
certainly does. God is very interested in the way His daughters dress. He 
wants Christian women to dress modestly and never in such a way as 
to tempt men. The Holy Spirit exhorts women to be “sensible in the way 
they  dress.  Christian  women  should  be  noticed  for  being  kind  and  good  
and not for the way they fix their hair or because of their jewels or fancy 
clothes” (1 Timothy 2:9, 10 - Living).
One  can  imagine  how  angry  the  women  of  Isaiah’s  day  became  on  
hearing such strong preaching. They must have hated him and encour-
aged their husbands to kill him! 
Prophets are different from regular preachers. They speak what God 
lays on their hearts, even if their message offends the rich people and the 
women in a church. That’s why prophets are not popular. 
In Chapter 4, Jesus is called “the Branch of the Lord” (4:2). This chapter 
describes the day when the kingdom of God will be established all over 
the earth and Jesus will reign for 1000 years from Jerusalem. But what 
will  take  place  literally  during  the  millennial  reign  of  Christ  is  to  be  
fulfilled spiritually in  the  church  even  now,  because  Jesus  is  already  
King in the church and the kingdom of God has already come there. So 
we can apply this passage to the church spiritually. “When the Lord has 
washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion by the spirit of judgment 
and the spirit of burning, then the LORD will create over Mount Zion and 
over her assemblies the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all 
the glory will be a covering” (4:4, 5). The spirit of the world that has got 
into  the  church  and  especially  into  the  “daughters  of  Zion”  has  to  be  

358 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
cleansed away by fire. Then the glory of God will be seen in the church 
as it was seen over the tabernacle in the wilderness. If there is one thing 
that  is  required  in  the  church  today,  it  is  “the  spirit  of  judgment  and  
the  spirit  of  burning.”  Then  everyone  in  Zion  will  be  called  holy,  whose  
names  are  written  in  God’s  book  (4:3).  The  Lord  will  also  put  a  cover-
ing over His glory (4:5). In the Old Testament tabernacle, the beautiful 
curtains were on the inside. The outer covering was a dirty, brown cover-
ing made of animal-skins. In the church also there should be a glory on 
the inside that others cannot see. Outwardly, the true church will always 
be covered with reproach (Hebrews 13:13). This will protect the church 
from spiritual pride (verse 6).
In Chapter 5:8–23, we find Isaiah pronouncing a “Woe” (a curse) on six 
groups of people. We see Jesus also using this word “Woe” in Luke 6:24–
26. Isaiah pronounces a curse on “those who exploit the poor by buying 
up property so extensively so that the poor have no place to live; those who 
spend their time in sensual pleasures (drinking and partying) without any 
thought for God; those who keep on sinning and defy God to punish them; 
those who call evil good and good evil; those who are proud of their own 
cleverness;  and  those who  take  bribes  to  condemn  innocent  people”.  All  
such haughty and proud people will be humbled by God one day. What a 
need there is today to see that God hates and curses these things.
Chapter  6  is the central chapter of this first section of Isaiah.  Here  
Isaiah describes a vision he had of the Lord that humbled him. He saw 
the Lord seated on a lofty throne and a number of angelic beings called 
seraphs  (‘seraphim’  is  the  plural  of  ‘seraph’)  worshipping  Him.  Each  
seraph had six wings, and they covered their bodies with four wings and 
flew with two. In other words, they used four of their wings to worship 
God and two wings to serve Him. Jesus told the Samaritan woman that 
the Father seeks for worshippers. He also replied to Satan’s temptation 
with  the  words:  “You  shall  worship the  Lord  your  God  and  you  shall  
serve Him.” Notice there that worship must precede service. But we must 
also worship God more than we serve Him. The more we worship God, the 
more effective our service for Him will be.
Worship  means  a  total  surrender  of  everything  that  we  are  and  that  
we  have  to  God,  and  a  total  devotion  to  Christ.  Worship is  more  than  
thanksgiving and praise.  Worship  involves  recognising  God’s  holiness  
and  greatness,  and  acknowledging  Him  as  Lord  of  lords  and  King  of  
kings. These seraphs who had never sinned could not even look at God. 
They covered their faces before Him. That teaches us something about 
the “unapproachable light” of God’s holiness (1 Timothy 6:16). We must 
not think lightly of God’s holiness. It is a tremendous privilege that we 
are allowed to come before Him, through the blood and the righteousness 
of Jesus Christ.
When Isaiah saw all this, he was deeply convicted. The man who had 
just  been  pronouncing  “Woes” on  others,  pronounces  one  on  himself  

Prophecies of Judgement (Chapters 1 to 27)                                                                                       359
Isaiah
now – “Woe is me...” (6:5)! Not one of the “Woes” that he had pronounced 
on others was in error. But it was necessary for him as a prophet of God, 
to get alone before God and to see the sin within himself. This is what 
happens  when  we  see  the  glory  of  God.  We  will  still  see  the  wrongs  in  
others and speak against them when led by the Lord to do so. But we will 
see the sin in our own flesh first.
It is necessary for every prophet and preacher who stands in the pulpit 
and preaches against sin to see the sin in his flesh first. Otherwise he 
will soon become a backslider. Many preachers never cry out like Isaiah 
saying, “Woe unto me,” or like Paul saying, “O wretched man that I am. In 
my flesh there dwells no good thing” (Romans 7:18, 24).
Isaiah  was  particularly  convicted  about  his  speech.  He  said,  “Lord, 
I  am  a  man  of  unclean  lips”  (6:5).  Then  one  of  the  seraphs  took  a  coal  
from the altar in a pair of tongs and cleansed Isaiah’s lips immediately. 
The sin which Isaiah confessed was immediately forgiven. The fire that 
an angel could not touch (but needed a pair of tongs to take) could touch 
the lips of Isaiah. Man can receive an anointing from God that no angel 
can receive. 
Isaiah had a vision of both the throne and the altar here. Then the Lord 
asks, “Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?” (6:8). Isaiah replies, “Here 
am I. Send me.” We need to see both the throne and the altar constantly. 
We need to be struck down to the dust first with a vision of God’s holi-
ness, and then we need to be lifted up because the blood from the altar 
has cleansed us. Only then can we go forth and serve the Lord. We can’t 
go forth if God doesn’t send us. If we go without God sending us, then we 
will labour in vain. Many “Christian workers” in India have not been sent 
by God. Some organisation or man has sent them to the mission field. 
Or perhaps they have gone on their own. It is easy to engage in Christian 
activity in a vast country like India, because the need is so great. But if 
we want fruit that lasts for all eternity, God Himself must send us. Other 
godly men may confirm the call we receive from God – but they cannot call 
us. God called Saul and Barnabas personally to His service. The confir-
mation of that call came later through other prophets (Acts.13:1–4). And 
when  God  calls  us,  He  will  also  tell  us  what  to  preach.  He  told  Isaiah,  
“Go. Tell this people...” (6:9).
God is still the same today as He was in Isaiah’s time. Under the new 
covenant, the Holy Spirit dwells in our hearts and so we don’t hear God 
with our physical ears now, as Isaiah heard Him then. We hear His voice 
today in our hearts. But His voice is just as unmistakable. I have never 
heard  the  Lord’s  voice  audibly  with  my  physical  ears  and  I  have  never  
seen Him or an angel with my physical eyes. But I have seen Him and 
heard  Him  clearly  in  my  heart  many  times  during  the  last  56  years.  
Jesus said that those who believed in Him without seeing Him with their 
physical  eyes  are  actually  more  blessed  than  those  who  see  Him  and  
believe (John 20:29).

360 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
The commission that the Lord gave Isaiah was a very difficult one. 
He  told  him,  “Go  and  tell  my  people  this:  ‘Though  you  hear  my  words  
repeatedly, you won’t understand them. Though you watch and watch as 
I  perform  my  miracles,  still  you  won’t  know  what  they  mean.’  Dull  their  
understanding, close their ears, and shut their eyes. I don’t want them to 
see or to hear or to understand, or to turn to me to heal them” (6:9, 10). 
This  is  the  verse  that  Jesus  quoted  when  He  was  explaining  why  He  
spoke to people in parables (Matthew 13:15).
So  what  do  we  see  here?  A  vision  of  God,  a  vision  of  self,  a  vision  
of grace that forgives, a vision of anointed service, and finally, a vision 
of fruit (6:13). A holy seed would come forth from the corrupt nation of 
Judah. A remnant will be raised up for the Lord through our service.
In Chapter 7:14, we have this wonderful prophecy about the birth of 
Jesus: “A virgin will be with child and will bear a Son and she will call His 
name Immanuel.” (Quoted in Matthew 1:23).
In  Chapter  8:12,  13,  God  gives  a  word  to  His  people  who  were  terri-
fied by the armies that had joined together and were coming to fight 
against them. This is a very relevant word for us in India today, where 
we see anti-Christian forces attacking God’s people in many parts of our 
land.  The  Lord  says,  “You  are  not  to  fear  what  they  fear.  But  He  shall  
be your fear.” This verse is quoted in 1 Peter 3:14, 15. The Living Bible 
paraphrases it thus: “If you fear God, you need fear nothing else.” More 
than  40  years  ago,  I  got  this  verse  written  on  a  large  wooden  plaque  
and placed it prominently in the front-room of my house. This verse has 
strengthened me and many others to be free from the fear of men and of 
circumstances. And it has encouraged me to fear the one Person I should 
fear – God. Jesus also urged His disciples saying, “Don’t be afraid of those 
who can kill only your bodies – but can’t touch your souls! Fear only God 
who can destroy both soul and body in hell.” (Matthew 10:28 - Living). 
Isaiah  8:18  is  yet  another  verse  quoted  in  the  New  Testament  –  in  
Hebrews 2:13 – and there it refers to Jesus and us. “Behold, I and the 
children whom the Lord has given Me are for a sign and a wonder”. That 
should  apply  to  us  as  families  too.  We  must  bring  up  our  children  in  
such  a  way  that  they  are  different  from  other  children  in  the  world  
in  their  moral  character  and  in  their  ambitions.  We  and  our  children  
must be signs and wonders to the world around us, in that we live with 
eternity’s  values  in  mind  at  all  times.  Unfortunately  that  dividing  line  
between believers and unbelievers has gradually been erased by Satan 
over the years.
Chapter 9:2 is also quoted in Matthew 4:16: “The people who walk in 
darkness will see a great light”. This refers to Jesus visiting the people 
in Galilee. This verse also applies to us, for it is God’s will that we also 
should bring light into the darkness, wherever we go.
Chapter  9:6,  7  is  a  prophetic  reference  to  Jesus.  He  will  be  called  
“Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Prince of Peace and Eternal Father.” 

Prophecies of Judgement (Chapters 1 to 27)                                                                                       361
Isaiah
The phrase ‘Eternal Father’ here just means ‘Father of eternity’ and is not 
a reference to God the Father. 
In Chapter 9:6, it says, “The government will rest on His shoulders.” This 
verse has been a tremendous help to me in my ministry. During the past 
40 years, we have often faced problems in the churches that the Lord has 
planted through our ministry in India – problems similar to that which 
all parents face with growing children. Whenever I am told of a problem 
in one of our churches that baffles me, I have usually fallen on my face 
before God and said, “Lord, this is not my work. It is Yours. These are not 
my churches.  They  are  Yours.  Their  government  is  on  Your shoulders. 
The responsibility is Yours. If You want to close down a church, close it 
down. That’s Your business. I am only Your servant. Tell me what to do 
and I’ll do it.” A proprietor has every right to close down his shop if he so 
wishes. I will never try to keep some work open that the Lord wants to 
shut down. So many Christian workers are constantly struggling to prop 
up a work that they started, long after it has become evident that God is 
not in it. This is because they have taken the governing of God’s work on 
their own shoulders. When the government is on the Lord’s shoulders, it 
takes the stress and strain out of Christian work. It will bring rest into 
your life as it has brought to mine. The responsibility for the Lord’s work 
remains with Him forever. We are only servants.
Chapter  10  prophesies  the  destruction  of  Assyria,  which  was  the  
world’s  only  superpower,  at  that  time.  The  king  of  Assyria  is  a  type  of  
the Antichrist. 10:27 reads, “The yoke shall be destroyed because of the 
anointing”  (KJV).  It  is  the  anointing  of  the  Holy  Spirit  that  breaks  and  
destroys the yoke of sin and Satan – in our life, our home and our church.
In  contrast  to  the  reign  of  the  Antichrist  pictured  in  Chapter  10,  we  
have the kingdom of Christ pictured in Chapter 11. The sevenfold Holy 
Spirit mentioned in Revelation (that will rest on Christ) is called here the 
Spirit of the Lord, of wisdom, of understanding, of counsel, of strength, of 
knowledge and of the fear of the Lord. Verse 3 states that the Spirit would 
make Jesus so sensitive to the fear of the Lord that He would never judge 
anything by what His eyes saw or what His ears heard, but in righteous-
ness by the Spirit’s voice within. Jesus is our Example here. We too must 
never judge any person or circumstance by what our eyes or our ears tell 
us.  Instead,  we  must  seek  the  Lord  for  discernment  through  the  Holy  
Spirit, to form a correct judgement in every situation.
The time will come when the lion and the wolf and the lamb will lie down 
together (verse 6) – in the millennium, when Christ reigns on earth; and 
a little child will lead them all (verses 6, 7). This will be literally fulfilled 
when Christ sets up His kingdom on earth and God-fearing conditions 
prevail everywhere. But spiritually speaking this is true even now in the 
church. The wolf-like brother now fellowships with the lamb-like brother 
without trying to eat him up! The leopard-like sister lies down with the 
goat-like sister without devouring her! And the leader of this church is a 

362 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
little child – the brother who is most child-like – for Jesus said that the 
greatest person in God’s kingdom was a little child.
Chapter 12 speaks of the joy of salvation. “God is my salvation. With joy 
I will draw water from the springs of salvation. Cry aloud and shout for 
joy, because the One in the midst of you, the Holy One of Israel, is great” 
(verses 2, 3, 6).
Chapters 13 to 23 are prophecies relating to many of the nations in the 
Middle-East.  Then  follows  12  chapters  full  of  prophecies  of  judgement  
and blessing – up to Chapter 35. 
Chapter13 is about the fall of Babylon – a picture of what is described 
in Revelation 17 and 18.
Chapter14 continues to describe the fall of Babylon. Who is the ruler 
of Babylon – of this vast religious and commercial system? It is one who 
was  once  in  heaven  who  is  called  “the  shining  one  and  the  star  of  the  
morning” (verse 12). He is commonly referred to as Lucifer, because the 
KJV translation uses that name here. Five times, we read here that he 
said in his heart, “I will.” That is how he became the devil (verses 13, 14); 
and that is how sin first came into the universe.
Sin came when a created being said, “I will.” And salvation came when 
Jesus, the Son of God, came to earth and said, “Not as I will but as Thou 
wilt” – not just once, but all His life – as He Himself said in John 6:38: 
“I   came from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him Who sent 
Me”. Remember this all your life that whenever you do your own will, you 
are on the path of sin; and whenever you deny your own will to do the will 
of God, you are on the path of true holiness. That is the way of the cross 
that Jesus has called us to walk in. The cross cuts out our own will so 
that we do the will of God. All of us are following either Lucifer or Christ 
every day. Self-will is what builds Babylon finally.
Chapters15 to 23 are prophecies against Moab, Damascus, an unnamed 
country, Egypt, Ethiopia, Edom, Arabia and Tyre. In Chapter19, verses 
24  and  25,  we  have  the  beautiful  picture  of  the  day  when  Jews  and  
Gentiles  will  be  united  together,  when  people  from  Egypt,  Assyria  and  
Israel will all be brothers and sisters together in one church. 
In Chapter 20 we read that the Lord asked Isaiah to walk around bare-
foot in his underwear – without a cloak or sandals – to demonstrate to the 
people of Israel how they would be walking when they are taken captive.
In Chapter 22:13 we read of people who say, “Let us eat and drink for 
tomorrow we die,” – because they have no thought for eternity. This verse 
is quoted also in 1 Corinthians 15:32.
In Chapter 22 we read of two men:
1. Shebna, King Hezekiah’s Finance Minister, a greedy, selfish man and 
a type of the Antichrist (verses 15–19). 
2. Eliakim, a godly man, a type of Christ, “a nail in a sure place, a peg 
driven in a firm place” (verses 20–25).

Isaiah
Chapter 23 describes the destruction of Tyre. 
Chapters  24  to  27  are  prophecies  referring  to  the  day  of  the  Lord. 
Chapter  24  prophesies  the  destruction  of  the  earth  (verses  1–20),  and  
of  demons  (verses  21–23). Chapter  25:8  prophesies  that  death  will  be  
swallowed  up  one  day  in  resurrection.  Chapter  26:3  is a  promise  that  
can keep our minds at peace in the last days: “God will keep in perfect 
peace those whose minds are stayed on Him”. Verse 13 is a good verse 
of total surrender to the Lord: “Lord, other masters have ruled us before. 
But from now on, only You will rule us.” Verse 19 is again a prophecy of 
the resurrection: “Your dead will rise, those who lie in the dust will come 
back to life.” Verse 20 refers to the short period of the great tribulation; 
and verse 21 to the Lord’s return to earth for His saints. Chapter 27 then 
speaks about the destruction of the serpent, Satan, and of how the vine-
yard of the Lord will be restored. 
Prophecies of Judgement and of Blessing (Chapters 28 to 35)
Chapter 28 has some verses in it that are quoted in the New Testament. 
Verse 11 is quoted in 1 Corinthians 14:21 as a prophecy about the time 
when people would speak in tongues, which was fulfilled on the day of 
Pentecost. Verse 16 speaks about Christ the Cornerstone of the church. 
“Those  who  trust  in  this  cornerstone  will  never  be  shaken  or  disturbed.  
They  will  never  be  in  a  hurry.  They  will  be  solidly  founded.” Verse  20  
speaks in picture language of how human righteousness is incapable of 
covering man completely. Verse 21 tells us that judgement is an “unusual 
task” for God. He is reluctant to judge people. Verses 28 and 29 tell us 
how God breaks us in His great wisdom, in order to bless us. He assures 
us  that  He  will  never  allow  us  to  be  tested  beyond  our  ability  and  He  
knows when to stop the chastening.
Chapter  29  speaks  of  Jerusalem  (Ariel  –  “lion  of  God”  –  Hebrew)  that  
is  in  a  backslidden  condition.  Verses  11  and  12  show  us  the  need  to  
have Divine revelation to understand God’s Word. Jesus quoted verse 13 
in Mark  7:6,7  to  expose  the  hypocrisy  of  the  Pharisees.  One  day  God  
will pour out His Spirit on the inhabitants of Jerusalem and then it will 
become like a fertile field (verse 17). 
In 30:9–11,  we  read  of  the  people  of  Israel  telling  the  prophets  and  
seers: “Don’t prophesy the truth to us. Speak pleasant words to us. Don’t 
tell  us  about  the  Holy  One  of  Israel.” We find the same attitude today 
among many Christians to the messages of the prophets in the church. 
The Lord waits for all such people to repent (verses 15–18). He waits in 
order to give grace to those who will turn to Him (verse 18). And those 
who  turn  will  see  their  Teacher,  Jesus  (verse  20)  and  hear  the  voice  of  
the Holy Spirit (verse 21) correcting them when they go astray from the 
right path. And then finally we read of the Antichrist being cast into hell 
(verse  33 – Tophet is a picture of hell).

364 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
Chapter 31 refers to the curse that lies on those who go to man (Egypt) 
for  help  (See  Jeremiah  17:5–8). Chapter  32  speaks  about  the  coming  
reign of Christ. The women Isaiah spoke to in Chapter 3 are now invited 
to  repent  (verses  9–12).  Again,  the  Spirit  is  poured  out  on  those  who  
repent (verse 15), and this results in righteousness and peace. In Chapter 
33:14–16, Isaiah asks this very searching question: “Who can dwell with 
God? Who can dwell with a consuming fire?”  And  then  he  answers  it  
himself: “Those who walk righteously and speak with sincerity.” But he 
goes on to say that sinners are terrified in God’s presence and hypocrites 
tremble before Him. Chapter 34 speaks of the Lord’s vengeance against 
the nations. In Chapter 35, we read of the new covenant and the highway 
of holiness where the ransomed will walk (35:8, 10).
Hezekiah’s Deliverance from the Assyrians and from Sickness
The next four chapters (Chapters 36 to 39) are a historical record of events 
that took place during the reign of King Hezekiah. There are a number of 
spiritual lessons that we can learn from these chapters. 
The  first  lesson  we  learn  is  that  we  should  turn  to  the  Lord,  as 
Hezekiah did, when surrounded by enemies (Chapter 37) and when sick 
(Chapter 38). God can deliver us and He can heal us. 
We can also learn lessons from Hezekiah’s mistakes. His first mistake 
was to ask God to lengthen his life, when God had told him that his time 
on earth was over (Chapter 38:1–5). Contrast Paul and Peter who when 
they knew that the time of their departure had come, did not ask for any 
extension of their life on earth (2 Timothy 4:6; 2 Peter 1:14). But Hezekiah 
asked for this and God granted him 15 more years. “He gave them their 
demands but sent them leanness in their souls” (Psalm 106:15 - Living). 
It was during that extended period of life that Hezekiah produced a son 
Manasseh, who became the worst king that Judah ever had (2 Chronicles 
33:1–3).  God  knows  what  is  best  for  us  and  we  must  accept  His  will  
concerning the length of our lives. 
The second mistake  that  Hezekiah  made  was  caused  by  his  pride.  
God healed him of a deathly sickness and gave him a miraculous sign 
in confirmation – the sun went back in the sky by ten notches on the 
sundial (Chapter 38:8). In other words, the earth stopped and reversed its 
rotation for a while! When the king of Babylon saw this miracle, he sent 
messengers to congratulate Hezekiah – and in pride, Hezekiah showed off 
all his treasures to them (Chapter 39). This resulted in all of those treas-
ures being taken to Babylon later. Whenever we take the glory for what 
God does in our lives, we will, sooner or later, end up in spiritual loss. 
We also see here that Isaiah’s prophecies were not dependent on current 
world  conditions.  He  was  a  true  prophet  who  was  in  touch  with  God.  
Babylon  was  at  that  time  a  weak  country  struggling  for  independence  
from  the  great  world  power,  Assyria.  But  Isaiah  prophesied  accurately  

Prophecies of Comfort (Chapters 40 to 66)                                                                                         365
Isaiah
that Hezekiah’s treasures would be carried away to Babylon, and not to 
Assyria. And that was what happened some years later.
Prophecies of Comfort (Chapters 40 to 66)
Chapters 40 to 66 form the “New Testament” portion of Isaiah and there 
are many prophecies here about new covenant life to comfort and encour-
age God’s people.. 
Prophecies of Deliverance (Chapters 40 to 48)
It is significant that this section of Isaiah begins with a prophecy of the 
ministry  of  John  the  Baptist:  “A  voice  of  one  crying  in  the  wilderness  
saying,  ‘Clear  the  way  for  the  Lord  in  the  wilderness.  Make  smooth  the  
desert.’ ”  (Isaiah  40:3–5).  This  message  has  an  application  for  us  too.  
The  Lord  is  coming  back  a  second  time.  And  just  as  John  the  Baptist  
prepared the people for His first coming, the church must prepare people 
for His second coming.
So our message must essentially be the same as John the Baptist’s: 
• First of all, “the valleys must be lifted up” (verse 4). There is no place 
for discouragement and depression under the new covenant. We are 
never to say, “I am good for nothing, I am useless.” God is a God of 
encouragement.  He  has  lifted  us  up  in  Christ  and  given  us  dignity.  
We don’t have to live in the dumps – in the valleys – any more. We are 
children of the King and He lifts our heads up.
• Secondly, “the mountains must be brought low” (verse 4). All pride in 
us must be brought down.
• Thirdly, the  rough  places  must  become  smooth.  There  is  a  lot  of  
coarseness,  rudeness  and  roughness  in  our  lives.  These  have  to  be  
smoothened out and we have to become gracious and gentle. 
• Fourthly, the  crooked  paths  must  become  straight  (This  is  how  this  
verse is quoted in Luke 3:5). There are crooked areas in our lives such 
as  unrighteousness  in  money  matters.  All  of  that  has  to  be  made  
straight.
This is what true repentance involves – the valleys being lifted up, the 
mountains being brought down, the rough places made smooth, and the 
crooked paths made straight. Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed 
in our flesh. In our flesh, others will see the glory of Jesus Christ. That 
is how we are to prepare people for the coming of the Lord. “The mouth 
of the Lord has spoken it and all flesh shall see the salvation of the Lord”.
Chapter 40:6, 7 are quoted in 1 Peter 1:24, 25: “All flesh is like grass.” 
We have already seen that all human beings are like dust without breath. 
Here they are described as grass. All the honour that you can get from 

366 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
people in the world is only like some small flower that grows on the grass. 
The grass withers and the flower fades when the breath of the Lord blows 
upon it. But Peter goes on to say there, “But the word of the Lord endures 
forever.”  So  those  who  have  lived  by  the  principles  of  God’s  word  will  
remain when all the glory of man is destroyed one day. We must never 
forget that. Everything we see around us is going to perish one day. If we 
live by the word of God, we will have something eternal.
Chapter 40:10, 11 speak of the coming of the Lord. “The Lord will come. 
His reward is with Him. And like a shepherd He will take care of His flock. 
He will carry the lambs in His bosom.” 
Chapter  40:12  to  17  speak  about  the  control  God  exercises  over  the  
whole universe. He created everything from nothing. Verse 13 is quoted 
in 1 Corinthians 2:16: “Who has taught the Holy Spirit, or as His counsel-
lor informed Him?”
All the nations of the earth are as nothing before Him (verse 17). All the 
inhabitants of the world are all less than nothing and meaningless. We 
must see this sovereign rule of God, if we are to serve Him effectively 
and fearlessly – especially when we go to difficult places where people 
appear to be so powerful because they have the authority of the State 
behind  them  and  oppose  us  as  we  seek  to  serve  the  Lord.  We  must  
remember these verses then and trust in the tremendous power of God 
to protect us and to preserve us. 
Chapter 40:21, 22: “Don’t you know and have you not heard? It is He 
who sits above the circle of the earth.” This was written 2700 years ago 
and Isaiah clearly mentions here that the earth was not flat, but spher-
ical.  That  was  hundreds  of  years  before  anyone  else  on  earth  believed  
this. Solomon also mentions the spherical nature of the earth in Proverbs 
8:27 (NASB). Jesus also implied that the earth was spherical by referring 
to it being day in some places and night in other places when He returns 
from heaven (Luke 17:31, 34).
Chapter 40:26: “Look at the One who controls the stars. He has given 
them  all  names.”  Isaiah  was  given  a  vision  not  only  of  God’s  awesome  
holiness (Chapter 6), but also of His almighty power. These are the two 
visions of God that we must always have before us when we serve Him.
Chapter 40:29–31: This verse teaches that this almighty God Whom we 
worship and serve will give us strength when we are weak. When we 
lack might, He will give us power. He will give us health and strength 
to serve Him. Even young people may grow weary and tired and vigor-
ous  young  men  may  get  exhausted  in  trying  to  serve  the  Lord.  But  
those who wait on the Lord, no matter what their age, will gain new 
strength.  What  a  wonderful  promise!  And  when  young  people  are  
collapsing, these older men “who wait on the Lord will mount up with 

Prophecies of Deliverance (Chapters 40 to 48)                                                                                   367
Isaiah
wings like eagles. They will run and won’t get tired. They will walk and 
they will never become weary”.
I  want  to  encourage  you  young  people:  From  early  youth,  learn  to  
wait upon the Lord in simple trust for all your needs. You will gain new 
strength,  as  this  verse  says.  Or  as  another  translation  puts  it:  “Those 
who wait on the Lord will exchange their strength”. That means that we 
give our human strength to the Lord and He gives us His Divine strength 
in exchange! Hallelujah!! It is wonderful to exchange everything we have 
with the Lord. Jesus told the Father, “All that I have is Yours, Father. And 
all that You have is mine” (John 17:10). In the Lord’s service you need the 
Lord’s strength to see you through. We who serve the Lord really need to 
trust the Lord to give us supernatural strength from above, His resurrec-
tion power - not only in our spirit but in our bodies too. Then we will bear 
fruit for Him even in old age (Psalm 92:14).
Chapters  40  to  46  have  been  a  precious  portion  of  Scripture  to  me,  
in  my  service  for  the  Lord.  I  would  encourage  all  of  you  who  serve  the  
Lord  to  meditate  on  these  chapters  seriously.  There  are  some  tremen-
dous  promises  here  for  those  who  are  wholeheartedly  seeking  to  serve  
God walking in the footsteps of that first true Servant of Jehovah, our 
Lord Jesus Christ.
Chapter  41:8–18:  Here  are  some  promises  to  encourage  you  greatly  
when you face difficult situations! The Lord says, “I have chosen you, 
not  rejected  you.  Don’t  be  afraid.  I  am  with  you.  Don’t  look  anxiously  
about you. I am your God. I will strengthen you. I will help you. I will 
uphold you with My right hand. All those who are angry with you, will 
be ashamed and dishonoured. Those who fight with you will become 
as  nothing.  They  will  perish.  You  will  look  for  those  who  quarrel  with  
you. But you will not find them. Those who make war with you will 
become nothing and nonexistent one day because I am your Lord your 
God.  I  hold  your  right  hand.  I  say  to  you,  ‘Don’t  fear.’  I  will  help  you.  
You  are  a  worm.  But  don’t  be  afraid.  I’ll  help  you.  Even  though  you  
are  so  weak,  I  am  going  to  make  you  a  new,  sharp,  threshing  sledge  
with double edges (because the Word of God, the two-edged sword, is 
in your mouth). You will thresh these mighty mountains to pieces and 
pulverise them. You will make the hills like chaff. And you will rejoice in 
your Lord your God.” Take these words to heart, you who seek to serve 
the Lord. Apply them to yourself and claim them in Jesus’ name.
Chapter 41:17, 18: When the afflicted and needy (God is always inter-
ested in listening to the cry of those who are poor in spirit) are seeking 
for water (that is the Holy Spirit), when their tongue is parched, and they 
say, ‘O God, I cannot live without the power of the Holy Spirit,’ I the Lord 
will answer them. I will open rivers in their lives, springs in the midst of 

368 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
their  lives.  I’ll  make  their  life  like  pools  of  water.  And  their  dry  life  will  
become like a fountain of water. These promises have been a tremendous 
blessing and encouragement to me for many years – and I pass them on 
to you.
Chapter 42 speaks of Jesus as the Servant of Jehovah Who is anointed 
by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is one of the main themes of the New 
Testament and the Holy Spirit is also one of the main themes in Isaiah 40 
to 66. “Behold My Servant whom I uphold.” A true servant of God is one 
who is upheld by God, not by money or by an organisation or any human 
agency.  The  Lord  is  the  One  Who  should  uphold  us  at  all  times.  Men  
may give us gifts. But we must never depend on men or money. The word 
“uphold” refers to that which we are dependent on. We must be depend-
ent on the Lord alone. It is when we come to the place of helplessness 
that God puts His Spirit on us. 
Chapter 42:2: “He will not cry out or raise His voice in the streets.” This 
is quoted as referring to Jesus in Matthew 12:19, 20, where it goes on to 
say, “He will not make His voice heard in the streets. A bruised reed He 
will not break.” That means that the Lord will never discourage anyone 
who has made a mess of his life but will encourage him and heal him. 
The Lord will not put out the wick of a candle that is about to die. On 
the other hand, He will blow it into a flame. God is interested in helping 
weak believers who have failed. He is interested in helping those who are 
discouraged and depressed and to lift their spirits. A true servant of the 
Lord  will  always  have  a  similar  ministry  of  encouragement,  lifting  the  
spirits of those who are depressed and discouraged and who feel hope-
less and are fed up with life. Let us all seek for such a ministry because 
people need it everywhere.
Chapter  42:5–7:  The  Lord  tells  us:  “I  have  called  you  in  righteous-
ness.  I  have  called  you  to  open  blind  eyes,  to  bring  out  prisoners  from  
the dungeon.” This is a great ministry. But remember one thing always: 
“The Lord says, ‘I will never give My glory to another.’ ” (verse 8). We must 
never take any glory to ourselves in our ministry. To take the credit or 
the glory to ourselves is a very, very serious crime. It is worse than steal-
ing money. God may bless you and your ministry and use you mightily. 
But He will never give His glory to anyone. Once you start touching the 
glory  of  God  you  will  destroy  yourself,  like  many  servants  of  the  Lord  
have  been  destroyed.  Once  you  start  promoting  yourself  before  people,  
drawing people to yourself instead of to the Lord, and taking credit for 
what God did, you are on very dangerous ground. This is how thousands 
have lost God’s anointing on their lives.
Chapter  42:19:  “Who  is  blind  but  My  Servant?  Who  is  deaf  like  My  
Messenger? Who is so blind as the One who is at peace with Me totally, 
so  blind  as  the  Servant  of  the  Lord?”  This  looks  like  a  puzzling  verse,  
especially  since  it  refers  clearly  to  Jesus  (as  we  can  see  from  verse  1). 
What does it mean? It means that a true servant of God will be blind and 

Prophecies of Deliverance (Chapters 40 to 48)                                                                                   369
Isaiah
deaf to many things that he sees and hears around him. He sees many 
things,  but  he  doesn’t  observe  them  (verse  20).  He  doesn’t  go  around  
looking  for  sin  in  others.  He  doesn’t  go  around  listening  to  people  in  
order to catch them in something they said. The Pharisees were like that 
– always waiting to catch Jesus in something He said in order to accuse 
Him.  Many  Christians  are  unfortunately  like  that  too  –  always  waiting  
to accuse someone in something he said – very often because they are 
jealous  of  his  ministry.  Don’t  be  like  them.  Be  deaf  and  blind  to  many  
things  that  you  hear  and  see  around  you.  Did  you  hear  that  someone  
made a false accusation against you? If you were deaf you would not have 
heard it. Be “deaf” then! Isn’t it good for a servant of the Lord to be “blind” 
to attractive women? You have eyes, but you don’t see. You are “blind”! 
You  have  ears,  but  you  don’t  hear!  Because  you  do  not  judge  by  what  
your eyes see or what your ears hear. This is how Jesus lived and this is 
how we must live too (Isaiah 11:3).
Let me share with you now some of the wonderful promises found in 
these chapters which look forward to the establishing of the new cove-
nant. These are promises of God, and 2 Corinthians 1:20 says, “All the 
promises of God are ‘Yes’ and ‘Amen’ in Christ.” So we can claim these 
promises in Jesus’ name:
Chapter  43:1–5:  “Do  not  fear.  I  have  redeemed  you.  When  you  pass  
through the waters, I’ll be with you. When you pass through the rivers 
(difficult situations) they will not overflow you. When you walk through 
the fire it will not hurt you nor will the flame burn you. I am the Lord your 
God. You are precious in My sight. I gave Egypt for your ransom.” To us 
He says, “I gave you the blood of My Son for your ransom. Therefore you 
are precious in My eyes. Don’t be afraid.” The word “Do not be afraid” 
(or “Fear not”) were the words that Jesus spoke to His disciples. In the 
days  that  we  live  in,  this  is  the  word  that  we  need  to  hear  from  the  
Lord: “Don’t be afraid. I am with you.” 
Chapter 43:10, 11: “You are My witnesses, I am the Lord. There is no 
Saviour besides Me.” 
Chapter  43:18,  19,  25:  “Don’t  think  about  your  past  life.  Forget  the  
things that are behind. I will do something new. I will make a way in the 
wilderness and rivers in the desert. Look to the future. Don’t worry about 
your past failures. I am the One who wipes out your transgressions and I 
will not remember your sins any more.”
Chapter 44:3: “I’ll pour water on the thirsty ground. I’ll pour My Spirit on 
you and your children and My blessing on your descendents.”
Chapter 44:8: “Don’t tremble, don’t be afraid. You are My witnesses. Is 
there any God beside Me? Why are you worried about these people who 
worship idols?” Then He speaks about the folly of idolatry in the remain-
ing verses.

370 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
Chapter 44:21: “You are My servant. I have formed you. You will never 
be  forgotten  by  Me.”  It  is  easy  to  feel  lonely  and  forgotten  when  we  are  
faithful to the Lord or when we are serving Him in some lonely place. But 
God assures us that He will never forget us. This is our comfort. At times 
when  you  think  that  your  prayers  are  not  being  heard,  remember  this  
promise: “You will not be forgotten by Me.”
Chapter 44:28 to 45:6 is a prophecy about King Cyrus. Over 100 years 
before  Cyrus  was  even  born  and  long  before  his  Medo-Persian  empire  
became  world-rulers,  Isaiah  prophesied  about  him  by  name.  God  calls  
Cyrus  His  shepherd  who  would  tell  the  Jews  to  go  back  and  build  the  
temple (we read of this being fulfilled in the book of Ezra).
Chapter 45:9: “Woe unto the man who quarrels with his Maker. Can the 
clay say to the potter, ‘What are you doing?’ ” Don’t argue with God in the 
way  He  deals  with  you.  Humble  yourself  and  accept  His  dealings  with  
you. If He takes you through difficult situations, it is to mould you into a 
useful vessel for His glory. Don’t complain or grumble.
Chapter 45:10 has special relevance to our country of India where most 
parents don’t like to have a girl baby. We all know that there are sad cases 
where  girl  babies  are  left  at  the  doorsteps  of  orphanages  or  thrown  into  
garbage  bins  or  even  killed.  This  verse  is  for  all  such  parents.  “Woe  to  
(a curse be on) the one who says to a father, ‘What are you begetting?’ or to 
a woman, ‘What are you giving birth to?” Is it a girl? I wanted a boy. There is 
a curse on people who question God’s gifts like that. Even if it is a mentally 
challenged (retarded) child, we have no right to kill it. If God decides to give 
you such a child, it can make you into a person of great compassion. This 
verse also shows us that there is a woe (curse) on those who abort babies.
Chapter 45:17: “You will not be put to shame or humiliated to all eter-
nity.” Jesus was humiliated, and we may be humiliated that way too. But 
from the eternal standpoint, we will never be put to shame, if we follow 
the Lord. 
Here is another lovely verse: Chapter 45:22: “Turn to Me and be saved, 
all the ends of the earth. I am God, there is none else.”
Chapter 46:4 is a beautiful verse for older people: God promises, “Even 
to your old age I will be the same (I don’t grow old). Even when your hairs 
become gray I will carry you. I created you, I made you and I will carry 
you. I will deliver you.” God compares himself with idols here. Idolaters 
carry their gods but our God carries us! Do you carry your god or does 
your God carry you? That is the question. 
Chapter 47:8 is quoted in Revelation 18:7 and refers to Babylon (false 
Christianity) sitting as a queen and saying, “I will not sit as a widow.” It 
refers to a comfort-loving Christianity that does not know God, and that 
does not walk in humility.
Chapter 48:10, 11: “Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver. I have 
tested you in the furnace of affliction. For My own sake I will act for how 
can My name be profaned.” Affliction is a testing process meant to test 

Prophecies of the Messiah (Chapters 49 to 57)                                                                                  371
Isaiah
our faithfulness. Testing will not be forever. Gold, after it is purified in 
the fire, is finally made into a crown for a king. One day God will take us 
and make us part of His crown. He does this for His own Name’s sake.
And then we see that word coming a second time: “My glory I will never 
give to another person” (48:11).
Chapter 48:17, 18: “I am the Lord who teaches you to profit, who leads 
you in the way you should go. If only you had listened to My command-
ments and paid attention to them, your well-being would have been like a 
river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.” Everything that 
God asks us to do is for our own profit and well-being. And when the 
Lord leads us, we will “not thirst even when going through the deserts. He 
will make water to flow from the rock” (48:21). But for the wicked there 
will never be any peace” (48:22). 
Prophecies of the Messiah (Chapters 49 to 57)
Chapters 49 to 57 are prophecies about Jesus, but we can apply many of 
the passages to ourselves too. 
Chapter 49 was the chapter through which the Lord called me to full-
time Christian ministry, as I was reading and meditating on it in my daily 
Bible-reading, on the morning of May 6, 1964. 
Chapter 49:2: “He has made my mouth like a sharp sword.” When we 
speak  God’s  word,  it  can  at  times  be  like  a  sharp  sword  and  at  times  
as words of comfort. “In the shadow of His hand He has concealed me. 
He has hidden me in His quiver.” Then he speaks of the temptation to be 
discouraged, “Lord, I have wasted my life. I have not spent my strength 
usefully.” (verse 4). A servant of the Lord can be tempted to be discour-
aged frequently. Paul was. But he never gave into it. The Lord says, “Don’t 
worry. I am going to use you. I am going to make you a light to the nations” 
(verse 6).
Chapter 49:14, 15: “Zion said ‘The Lord has forgotten me’. Can a woman 
forget her nursing child and have no compassion on the son of her womb? 
Even these may forget, but I will not forget you.” When God wants to show 
that  His  love  is  greater  than  any  human  love,  the  greatest  example  of  
human love He finds on earth is that of a mother for her child. He doesn’t 
say,  “Can  a  husband  forget  his  wife?”  –  because  husbands  may  forget  
their wives often! Wives will forget their husbands too. But a mother can 
never forget her newly-born child. And He goes on to say that even if a 
mother forgets, He will not forget us. That promise is enough to comfort 
and  encourage  us  all  through  our  earthly  lives.  God  then  says,  “I  have  
inscribed you on the palms of My hands” (verse 16). That is a prophetic 
reference to the holes that would remain in the palms of Jesus’ hands even 
after His resurrection. Our names have been inscribed in those holes!
Chapter 49:23 has been a tremendous encouragement to me through 
many years. “Those who hopefully wait for Me will never be put to shame.” 

372 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
Praise God for that wonderful promise. If you trust in the Lord totally and 
wait for Him alone to act on your behalf, I can assure you that you will 
never be put to shame in your entire life.
Chapter  49:25:  “The  captives  of  the  mighty  will  be  taken  away.  I  will  
contend with the one who contends with you and I will save your sons.” 
No-one  need  be  a  captive  of  sin  or  of  Satan.  If  any  of  our  children  are  
captives of Satan, God promises here to save them from that captivity. 
Let us claim that promise for all our children.
Chapter 50:4 is a prophecy about Jesus. It says here that Jesus would 
have a disciplined tongue which He would use to comfort weary people 
with words in season. The tongue is the main part of our body that God 
uses and so every servant of God must discipline its use. We already saw 
that Jesus’ mouth was like a sharp sword (49:2). God’s Word that comes 
out  of  our  mouths  is  at  times  like  a  sharp  sword  that  cuts  the  heart  
open and exposes wrong motives, and at times it is a gentle word that 
encourages. 
We  read  here  that  Jesus  would  wake  up  every  morning  to  listen  to  
what the Father had to say (verse 4). And when He heard something He 
was immediately obedient. He accepted His Father’s will even when that 
involved allowing other people to slap Him and hit Him and spit on Him 
(verses 5, 6). And when people did all this, Jesus “set His face like a flint” 
(verse 7), not to take revenge on them or to threaten them but to forgive 
them and bless them. He knew that he would not be ashamed because 
the One who vindicated Him was always near (verse 8). Every servant of 
God can say these words “Who will fight with me? Let us stand together.” 
Have you got a case against me? Do you want to take me to court? “The 
Lord God will help me. Who is there to accuse me and condemn me? They 
will all wear out like a garment.” (verse 9).
Chapter  50:10:  Even  when  you  fear  the  Lord,  and  obey  the  voice  of  
Jesus  His  Servant,  there  could  still  be  times  when  the  Lord  will  allow  
you to grope in the dark without light, in order to strengthen your faith. 
What  should  you  do  at  such  times?  Trust  in  God  totally.  “Never  doubt  
in the darkness what God has shown you in the light.” If someone gave 
you a 100-rupee note that you saw clearly in the light, would you doubt 
in  the  darkness  (when  you  can’t  see  clearly)  whether  that  was  really  a  
100-rupee note or not? You would not, because you had already seen it 
clearly in the light. In the same way, there are times in our life when the 
light of God is bright and He shows us how much He loves us and cares 
for us. Later on, when times of pressure and trial come upon us, we need 
not doubt His love.
Verse 11 warns us that at such times, we should not light a human fire 
to produce light. Those who do so “will lie down in torment.” That means 
that we should not lean upon men in our times of trial. We should not 
use human methods to defend ourselves or to escape the trials that God

Isaiah
sends into our lives. We must trust Him to defend us and to release us 
from the trial in His own way and in His own time.
Chapter 51:1: “Those who seek the Lord, those who pursue righteousness, 
look to the rock from which you are hewn and the quarry from which you 
were dug.” We should never forget the pit we were in, when the Lord found 
us – the hopeless condition we were in before we were saved. If we remem-
ber that, we will never despise other people. We won’t be afraid of people 
either: “Listen to Me, you who know righteousness. Don’t fear the reproach 
of men nor be afraid of their revilings. I am He Who comforts you. Why are 
you afraid of man who dies and the son of man who is made like grass and 
forget the Lord Who stretched out the heavens?” (verses 7, 12, 13).
Chapter 51:16, 17: “I have put My words in your mouth. I have covered 
you with the shadow of My hand. Say to Zion (the church), ‘You are My 
people.  Rouse  yourself.’  ”  It  is  only  when  we  are  encouraged  ourselves,  
that we can encourage others.
Chapter 52:5: The Lord says, “My name is continually blasphemed the 
whole day long.” This verse is quoted in Romans 2:24 as indicating that 
God’s Name was blasphemed among the heathen because of Israel. This is 
true of Christians too in many places. The Name of Jesus is dishonoured 
in India, not as much by the heathen as it is by the way most Christians 
live. India has not rejected Christ. It has rejected the Christ it has seen in 
Christians, which is not the true Christ. But in contrast, “how lovely on 
the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news (the gospel), who 
announces peace and brings good news of happiness, and says to Zion, 
‘Your God reigns.’ ” (verse 7). The good news is not just that Jesus died for 
our sins, but also that He is now reigning, having all authority in heaven 
and on earth. That is the full gospel we are to proclaim.
Chapter 52:13, 14 teach us that when Jesus died on the cross His face 
was so disfigured by the beatings that He received that it did not look 
like the face of a human being at all. The pictures that we have all seen 
of Jesus hanging on the cross with a beautiful face are not true. His face 
was beaten and disfigured. Jesus was the most beautiful Person that 
ever walked on this earth. But when He hung on the cross, His face was 
so disfigured that it was the ugliest face of all.
Chapter 53 is the central chapter of this section of Isaiah and is the 
chapter  of  the  cross.  The  chapter  begins  with  a  question:  “Who  has  
believed our message?” Who in Israel would believe what Isaiah proph-
esied that the Messiah would come, not with power, but as a despised 
person,  as  a  root  out  of  a  dry  ground?  “He  grew  up  before  His  Father” 
(verse 2). The secret of Jesus’ life was that He did not live before the face 
of men but before the face of His Father. He was not attractive to men 
when He hung on the cross. We read that “He had no appearance that 
we should be attracted to Him” (verse 2). The message of the gospel is not 
attractive  to  man  even  today.  Christ  was  not  accepted  by  the  world  in  
the first century; and He is not accepted by the world in the twenty-first 

374 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
century either. The Christ that some claim to appreciate today is a false 
Christ, and not the real One Who spoke against sin, against the love of 
money, and taught people to love even their enemies. The real Christ is 
despised, forsaken and rejected even today.
And  if  you  follow  the  real  Christ,  I  assure  you  that  you  will  face  the  
same rejection by the world that He faced. You will be despised even by 
much of Christendom, just as Jesus was by most of the religious people 
of His day. It was not the Greeks and Romans who despised Jesus and 
rejected  Him,  but  the  Pharisees  (the  fundamentalists  of  His  day).  Who  
has  a  heart  to  accept  the  word  of  the  cross  –  even  today?  We  can  be  
excited when we hear the wonderful promises of blessing that are found 
in the Scriptures. But the word of the cross comes along with the prom-
ises in the same package. You cannot have one without the other. One 
reason for the shallowness in the lives of many Christians today is that 
they have tried to claim the promises without taking up their cross.
Notice  that  it  says  three  times  in  verse  7  that  Jesus  was  silent.  “He 
did  not  open  His  mouth.  He  was  silent.  He  did  not  open  His  mouth.”  As  
believers, we must know how to open our mouths wide and shout to the 
Lord at times when we praise and thank Him. We must also know how 
to keep our mouths shut when we are insulted, criticised and slandered. 
Jesus knew how to praise His Father and He also knew how to be silent. 
Unfortunately, it is the other way round with many Christians. They are 
silent when it comes to shouting God’s praises in the meetings; but they 
do  know  how  to  shout  and  defend  themselves  when  someone  accuses  
them  or  hurts  them.  But  that  is  the  characteristic  of  an  upside-down  
world, and Christians must be different.
In verse  10,  we  read  that  the  Father  was  pleased  to  crush  Jesus  –  
and “therefore He will see His seed and prolong His days.” Those are the 
results that come out of the crushing. “He will prolong His days” means 
that Jesus would be resurrected from the dead. And “the good pleasure 
of the Lord will prosper in His hand.” 
This is the way for us to go too. And as “He was numbered with the trans-
gressors”  (verse  12),  we  too  will  be  misunderstood  by  other  Christians  
and categorised with the wicked.
Chapter 54:4–10 are beautiful verses of comfort for widows. “The Lord 
is  your  husband.  Don’t  be  afraid.  You  will  forget  the  shame  of  your  
youth and the reproach of your widowhood. My covenant of peace and 
My loving-kindness will not be removed from you.”
Chapter 54:13 is a promise for our children: “All your sons will become 
disciples  of  the  Lord  (discipled  by  the  Lord),  and  the  well-being  of  your  
sons  will  be  great.”  The  Lord  gave  this  promise  to  my  wife  and  to  me  
separately,  in  June  1968,  before  we  had  any  children  –  and  we  have  
claimed it for all four of our sons and seen it fulfilled. This is a wonderful

Isaiah
promise for all parents and I want to encourage all parents to claim it in 
Jesus’ name, saying, “Lord, I want all my children to become disciples of 
the Lord and their spiritual well-being to be great.” That does not mean 
that your children will never become sick, or that your children will never 
have  the  struggles  that  many  teenagers  often  go  through.  But  it  does  
mean that they will finally come through to the Lord. Claim it and don’t 
give up.
Chapter 54:15, 17: “If anyone comes to fight you, he will be routed for I 
am on your side. No weapon turned against you shall succeed. And you will 
have justice against every courtroom lie. This is the heritage of the servants 
of the Lord. This is the blessing I have given you.” (Living). These wonder-
ful promises are for all who serve the Lord. I praise the Lord that for more 
than 50 years I have experienced the fulfilment of these promises. Every 
evil thing that others have sought to do against me has only worked for 
my good, to make me more like Christ. Jesus was falsely accused – and 
so  were  Peter  and  Paul.  If  you  follow  the  Lord  wholeheartedly,  you  too  
will  face  such  false  accusations  from  those  who  are  convicted  by  your  
message  and  from  those  who  are  jealous  of  your  ministry.  Many  may  
believe their accusations. Let them do so. Don’t be disturbed. God will 
shut their mouths one day and vindicate you. “Their vindication is from 
Me,” says the Lord. You don’t have to defend yourself. God Himself will 
defend you. I have proved the reality of that for more than 50 years now. 
Whenever people have accused me, the Lord has always told me to keep 
my mouth shut and to let others believe whatever they want to about me. 
Even if people believe that you are the Devil incarnate, let them do so – 
as they believed about your Saviour! Keep your mouth shut and one day 
God Himself will vindicate you. Wait for the Lord to do that. Live before 
God’s face and leave your reputation in His hands.
In 55:1, we read an invitation: “Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; 
and you who have no money come ... buy without money and without 
cost.” This is an invitation to accept the message of the gospel. The gospel 
must  always  be  offered  “without  charge”,  as  we  read  in  1  Corinthians  
9:18. It is a great shame that so many evangelists take offerings in public 
gospel  meetings  before  preaching  the  gospel.  Jesus  and  the  apostles  
never did that. This is just one indication of how far Christian preachers 
today have drifted from the true faith. In verses 8, 9 the Lord says, “‘My 
thoughts are not your thoughts nor are your ways My ways,’ declares the 
Lord.  As  the  heavens  are  higher  than  the  earth,  so  are  My  ways  higher  
than  your  ways.”  This  teaches  us  that  our  human  way  of  thinking  is  
earthly  and  we  have  to  learn  God’s  ways  from  Him  through  His  Word,  
if  we  are  to  serve  Him  effectively.  Verse  11:  “My  word  which  goes  forth  
from My mouth will not return empty.” After our way of thinking has been 
renewed and aligned with God’s way, then we can speak forth His Word 
– and that word will never return empty. We must never preach our own 
ideas or the teachings of psychology – as many are doing in Christendom 

376 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
today.  Our  messages  must  be  rooted  in  the  Bible,  so  that  the  faith  of  
people can rest on the Word of God and not in human reasoning. In all 
my spoken and written ministry through these many years, I have always 
spoken and written from the Bible alone – because God’s Word is more 
reliable than my word. Be a man of the Word in your preaching.
In 56:2–5 the Lord emphasises the importance of keeping the Sabbath. 
This  was  a  very  important  commandment  for  Israel.  But  it  was  a  sign  
between  God  and  Israel  alone  (Exodus  31:16,  17)  and  that  is  why  we  
don’t have to keep it today. But the spiritual application of it, however, 
is  for  us.  Hebrews  4:1–11  teaches  us  that  the  Old  Testament  Sabbath  
symbolised  the  life  of  rest  that  God  wants  us  to  enter  into,  in  Christ.  
Verse 7 was quoted by Jesus in Mark 11:17, “My house should be called 
a house of prayer for all people.” Many preachers have turned the church 
into a place to make money for themselves – just like the sellers of sheep 
and doves in the temple, in Jesus’ time. And the Lord will turn them out 
one day. The church is a house of prayer and not a place of business. In 
verses 10 and 11, God says that His servants have become blind (without 
spiritual  discernment)  and  dumb  –  like  watchdogs  that  do  not  bark  
even when the thief comes. The shepherds of God’s people have become 
greedy for money and seek their own at every turn. What a picture of the 
pathetic state of affairs in much of Christendom today!
Chapter 57:1: “The righteous man perishes and no man takes it to heart.” 
Godly people are becoming scarce in the world today. But hardly anyone 
seems to be concerned about it. The greatest need of the hour is for genu-
inely godly men. Verse 15: Here God says that there are only two places 
where He lives: in heaven and in the heart of a humble, lowly person. We 
can have the privilege of the Creator of the universe living in our hearts, 
if  we  are  humble  and  lowly.  Verse  19:  “Peace,  peace,  to  him  who  is  far  
and to him who is near.” This is quoted in Ephesians 2:17 as a prophetic 
reference to the fact that Jews and Gentiles would be brought together 
in one body by Christ. Verses 20, 21: “The wicked are like the tossing sea 
that tosses up mud (from the bottom). There is no peace for the wicked.” 
Wicked people never seek for peace in relationships but always bring up 
old matters that were buried in the past to disturb the relationship. This 
is often the case with wicked husbands and wives.
Prophecies of the Future (Chapters 58 to 66)
Chapter 58 is a beautiful chapter that is worthy of careful study, because 
it has many wonderful promises. It speaks about the right way to fast. 
God says that true fasting is not a ritual but something that should lead 
to our sharing our bread with the hungry, caring for the poor and naked, 
putting an end to pointing fingers at others (accusing them), and giving 
ourselves for others (serving them). Those who fulfil these conditions will 
find light arising for them in the darkness, and the Lord healing their

Isaiah
sicknesses and guiding them continually. They will become like unfail-
ing springs of water, blessing others wherever they go. God abundantly 
rewards those who have a concern for others.
Chapter  59:  The  Lord  does  not  hear  many  prayers  because  there  is  
unconfessed sin in the hearts of those who pray (verses 1, 2). Sin sepa-
rates man from God (verse 2). Verse 16 says that the Lord was amazed to 
find at that time that there were no intercessors among His people. This 
is also the sad condition in many churches today. God looks for interces-
sors who will pray for others. Verse 19 (KJV): “When the enemy comes in 
like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.” God 
wants the church to be like a banner that always stands against Satan 
in spiritual warfare. Verse 21: “My Spirit and My words shall not depart 
from your mouth nor from the mouth of your offspring or your offspring’s 
offspring.”  The  anointing  of  the  Holy  Spirit  is  the  greatest  gift  God  can  
ever give us and the ability to speak forth His Word is the greatest priv-
ilege that we can ever have. Here God promises that He will give these 
gifts not only to us but to our children and our grandchildren as well. 
What a promise to claim.
Chapter 60:1: “Arise, shine, for your light is come and the glory of the 
Lord has risen upon you.” This is a prophetic reference to the glory of God 
that we can have in our lives in this new-covenant age. “The Lord Himself 
will be our Light and our God will be our glory” (verse 19).
Chapter 61:1, 2: These verses are a prophetic reference to Jesus being 
anointed  with  the  Holy  Spirit  to  proclaim  the  gospel  of  deliverance  to  
others.  This  is  the  passage  of  Scripture  that  Jesus  turned  to  when  He  
preached  His  first  sermon  in  the  synagogue  in  Nazareth.  Notice  that 
Jesus  stopped  with  proclaiming  “the  favourable  year  of  the  Lord”  and  
did not proclaim “the day of vengeance of God” for that day had not yet 
come  (compare  verse  2  with  Luke  4:19).  Notice  also  the  proportion  of  
God’s favour in relation to His judgement. It is a whole year of favour as 
opposed to just a single day of judgement. That is a proportion of 365:1 
in  favour  of  grace.  God  is  trying  to  show  us  here  that  He  would  much  
rather show us favour than judge us. Our attitude to others should also 
be the same. We should be 365 times more ready to bless others and to 
be gracious to them than to judge them. God has come to take away all 
heaviness from our lives and to replace it with a spirit of praise (verse 3). 
Verse 10 speaks of God clothing us with the righteousness of Christ and 
making us the bride of Christ.
Chapter  62:3,  4  continue  to  speak  of  the  bridal  relationship  that  we  
have with our Lord. In verses 6, 7, those who are called to be watchmen 
on the walls of Jerusalem (the church) are urged to keep on warning and 
exhorting God’s people and those who have the ministry of intercession 
are urged not to stop interceding until God makes the church an object 
of praise and glory on the earth. Since He Himself has promised to do so, 
we can claim His promise boldly in prayer (verses 1, 11). 

378 Through the Bible: Prophecies of Judgement and Comfort 
Isaiah
Chapter 63:8 & 9 speak of our Saviour being “afflicted in all our afflic-
tions” and of how “He saves us by His presence.” But then it goes on to 
warn us in verse 10 of those who rebelled against and grieved His Holy 
Spirit, so that the Spirit turned around and became their enemy! That 
is a warning for all of us to live in fear. The Spirit seeks to lead us into a 
life of rest as He led the Israelites into Canaan (verse 14), but we must 
respond to His call.
Chapter  63:15  to  64:1  is  a  prayer  to  God  to  work  again  among  His  
people  and  to  send  a  revival.  Chapter  64:1  is  a  good  prayer  for  us  to  
pray frequently. This is what we need in the church. Verse 4 is quoted 
in 1 Corinthians 2:9, but slightly differently there. In 1 Corinthians, it is 
written that God has prepared wonderful things for those who love Him, 
whereas  in  Isaiah  it  is  written  that  He  has  prepared  these  things  for  
those who wait for Him. From this we learn that those who love Him will 
always wait for Him. We learn many things when we compare Scripture 
with Scripture. This passage is not referring to what God has prepared 
for His people in heaven, but rather to the wonderful blessings of the new 
covenant that He has prepared for His people right now. 1 Corinthians 
2:10  goes  on  to  say  that  the  Holy  Spirit  has  revealed  these  wonderful  
things to us. Verse 5: “You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness”. 
God  loves  to  meet  with  those  who  not  only  do  righteousness  but  who  
rejoice in doing it. But then it reminds us in verse 6 that “all our righteous 
deeds are like a filthy garment.” So our best deeds are like the filthiest 
rags imaginable in God’s eyes, for He is so utterly holy. We may call some 
people good, but no-one is truly good in God’s eyes. Only God Himself is 
truly good (Mark 10:18). Christ’s righteousness must therefore clothe a 
person if he is to be accepted by God.
Chapter  65:5:  Here  God  expresses  His  disgust  with  those  who  are  
self-righteous,  who  have  this  attitude  to  others:  “Do  not  come  near  me  
for I am holier than you.” Such people are as detestable to God as smoke 
going into one’s nose. He detests all who look down on others. Verse 17 
is a prophecy of the new heavens and new earth. Verse 24 is a wonderful 
promise that we can claim when we pray: “Before they call I will answer 
and while they are still speaking, I will hear.” God is more eager to hear 
us and to answer our prayers than we are to hear.
Chapter  66:1,  2:  Here  God  challenges  us  by  asking  who  can  even  
imagine that they can build a house (church) for Him, when the entire 
heaven is just His throne and the whole earth is but His footstool!! Many 
proudly call themselves “church-planters”!! But then God goes on to say 
that He will enable a certain type of person to build His house – the one 
who is humble and contrite of spirit and who trembles at His Word. God 
looks  with  favour  only  at  those  who  are  broken  and  humble  in  their  
spirits and who tremble at every command in His Word (obeying it imme-
diately). Verse 5 indicates that those who tremble at God’s Word are often 
hated  and  rejected  by  their  brothers.  This  has  been  true  throughout  

Prophecies of the Future (Chapters 58 to 66)                                                                                     379
Isaiah
church history. But the Lord encourages such people by saying that their 
enemies will finally be put to shame. So humble yourself and tremble at 
God’s Word and God will always be with you. In verse 13, God further 
encourages such people by saying that He will comfort them “as a mother 
comforts her children.”
Finally in verses 22–24, we read of the new heavens and the new earth 
that will be established when the Lord returns. Those who are Abraham’s 
spiritual seed will have eternal life, while others will burn in hell with a 
fire that will never be quenched.
Indeed Isaiah is a wonderful new covenant book in the Old Testament. 



JEREMIAH
God’s Last Warning to Judah
J
eremiah preached to the southern kingdom of Judah for more than 
40 years. He was the last prophet God sent to save Judah from being 
sent into captivity. Jeremiah tried his best to turn Judah back from 
their sins and from facing the judgement of God. But he did not succeed. 
Zephaniah, Habakkuk, Daniel, and Ezekiel, were his contemporaries. 
Jeremiah was not a hard man even though he spoke very strongly. He 
wept secretly for Judah’s sins. He felt very deeply about the backsliding 
of God’s people. He was a very simple man and he started prophesy-
ing when he was very young. He was very sensitive in his spirit, and 
at the same time very strong. These are good qualities for anyone who 
preaches God’s word – to be simple at heart, sensitive to the feelings of 
others, and yet very strong when it comes to proclaiming the truth. In 
that sense, Jeremiah was like Jesus. Jesus also lived very simply and 
was very sensitive to the hurts of others; and He wept over Jerusalem 
just like Jeremiah wept over Jerusalem.
Once  when  Jesus  asked  the  people,  “Who  do  people  say  that  I  am?”  
They  replied  saying,  “Some  say  You  are  Jeremiah  come  back  again”  
(Matthew 16:13, 14). Why did they say that? Because there was so much 
similarity  between  Jesus  and  Jeremiah.  That  is  a  tremendous  compli-
ment to Jeremiah – that people mistook Jesus for him!!
Jesus  wept  and  suffered  because  God  wept  and  suffered.  Jeremiah  
also  wept  and  suffered  for  the  same  reason.  Though  Jeremiah  had  a  
great  concern  for  his  people  and  was  the  mouthpiece  of  God,  yet  his  
people misunderstood him. All the true prophets in previous generations 
had been misunderstood, persecuted and rejected. But Jeremiah never 
gave up even after prophesying for 40 years. He is a great example of a 
man who stood firm and true to God until the end of his life.

382 Through the Bible: God’s Last Warning to Judah
Jeremiah
He wrote many of his prophecies in dungeons – the prisons of those 
days. He prophesied during the reigns of many kings. A year before he 
came  on  the  scene  there  had  been  an  apparent  revival  under  Josiah  
who ruled Judah just after the 57-year long evil reigns of Manasseh and 
Amon (2 Kings 21:19–26). But that “revival”, like many “revivals” today, 
was only superficial.
The prominent phrase that we find in the book of Jeremiah is ‘the Lord 
of hosts.’ Other prophets also spoke of “the Lord of the armies of heaven”. 
This phrase occurs about 82 times in Jeremiah.
Jeremiah’s Call
The Lord called Jeremiah when he was a young man (1:5, 6) and said to 
him, “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you. Before you were born 
I consecrated you and appointed you a prophet to the nations.” God knew 
Jeremiah even before his body was formed in his mother’s womb. There 
is a lot of dispute nowadays about whether an embryo is a human being 
or not. Here is a verse that should clear that doubt forever – because God 
says  He  knew  Jeremiah  before  he  was  formed.  When  Jeremiah  was  a  
microscopic speck in his mother’s womb, God knew him and consecrated 
him to be a prophet. That is a great encouragement for us – to know that 
God had His eye on us even when we were just microscopic specks just 
conceived in our mother’s wombs. He has a plan for our lives just as He 
had a plan for Jeremiah.
Just imagine, when Jeremiah went through all those difficulties, how 
this thought must have encouraged him: “I am facing a lot of difficulties 
right now. But God knew me when I was in my mother’s womb and He 
planned my life then. And that plan will be fulfilled. I am going to yield to 
God utterly.” All of us too should think about that whenever we face trials 
and difficulties. God chose you before you were born and His plan for 
your life will be fulfilled. So don’t ever get discouraged.
Then Jeremiah said, “Lord, I don’t know how to speak.” It is amazing 
how  God  picks  up  people  to  be  prophets  who  are  not  good  at  public  
speaking. Moses was like that. He also said, “Lord, I am unable to speak 
publicly.” I want to encourage all of you. Don’t think that God cannot use 
you to preach His word just because you don’t have the ability to speak 
or the boldness to stand before people. The Lord said to Moses, “I made 
man’s  mouth.  Can’t  I  then  make  you  speak?”  (Exodus  4:10,  11).  If  you  
allow God to break you and to fill you with His Holy Spirit, He can make 
you also His spokesman. It all depends on your walk with God.
I was a shy, self-conscious person as a young Christian. But when God 
anointed me with His Spirit, He began to speak through me. He can do 
the same with you. And one more thing: Don’t ever say to God, “Lord, I am 
so young.” If God calls you and consecrates you, your age won’t make any 
difference. You don’t have to wait until you are an old man before you 

A Call to Repentance                                                                                                                                383
Jeremiah
start serving the Lord. As soon as you feel a burden in your heart, seek 
God to be filled with the Holy Spirit, and go forth and proclaim the word 
of God.
The Lord told Jeremiah, “Don’t say I am a youth, because everywhere 
I  send  you,  you  shall  go,  and  all  that  I  command  you,  you  shall  speak” 
(1:7). And then the Lord spoke a word to him that He often spoke to His 
prophets:  “Don’t  be  afraid,  because  I  am  with  you  to  deliver  you”  (1:8).  
This was the big advantage that all the true prophets had – the Lord was 
with them. Therefore they were not afraid of any man. That is the way we 
need to serve the Lord in India today as well. We must ensure that the 
Lord is with us.
The Lord touched Jeremiah’s mouth and told him, “I have put My words 
in  your  mouth”  (verse  9).  God  did  the  same  for  Isaiah  too.  Notice  then  
the  ministry  that  the  Lord  gave  Jeremiah.  Six  activities  are  mentioned  
here – plucking up, breaking down, destroying, overthrowing, building and 
planting (1:10). Four of these were negative and two – building and plant-
ing – were positive. Jeremiah had to tear down the old structure first and 
then put up God’s structure. That is not an easy thing to do. It is much 
easier to build a building on an empty plot of land.
Christendom today is in very similar condition to what Judah was in 
those  days.  There  are  huge  religious  structures  in  Christendom  today  
that are contrary to the Word of God. A prophet who comes with God’s 
word to such a situation will have to first pluck up, break down, destroy 
and overthrow many things before he can build and plant something of 
eternal value. It is this initial work with the bulldozer that many preach-
ers are unwilling to do. They seek to “stitch a patch of new cloth on an 
old  garment”.  But  the  Lord  says,  “No.  You  have  to  throw  away  the  old  
garment.  You  have  to  destroy  the  old  structure  completely  and  start  
afresh with something completely new” (Matt.9:16). If you don’t do that, 
you will not be able to build what God wants you to build. The Lord went 
on to encourage Jeremiah saying, “They will fight against you, but they 
won’t overcome you, for I am with you” (1:19).
In Chapters  2  to  45,  we  find  a  number  of  prophecies  addressed  to 
Judah. Then in Chapters 46 to 52, we find many prophecies addressed 
to other nations. We will look at these only briefly – something like my 
putting in place a few pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. You can complete the rest 
of the puzzle yourself!
A Call to Repentance
Chapter 2:13: “My people have committed two evils.” The two evils God 
charged them with were: First of all, they left their God, the fountain of 
waters. And secondly, they made vessels – idols – that had holes in them 
and could hold no water at all.
In Chapter 3, Jeremiah speaks about adulterous Judah and backslid-
den Israel. Israel was the northern kingdom that had gone into captivity 

384 Through the Bible: God’s Last Warning to Judah
Jeremiah
100 years earlier. The main burden that Jeremiah and the other prophets 
of his time sought to communicate to the people of Judah was this: “Your 
sister Israel did not listen to their prophets and so God sent them into 
captivity. Have you learned a lesson from that?” Judah did not learn a 
lesson from that. They kept saying, “We are not like them. We are better. 
That won’t happen to us.”
What  lesson  does  this  have  for  us  today?  Protestant  Christianity  is  
divided into two groups mainly. One is the regular, mainline, denomina-
tional churches. We could liken them to the northern kingdom of Israel. 
Then we have small non-conformist groups that call themselves “sepa-
rated  assemblies”.  When  these  groups  separated  themselves  initially  
they  did  so  with  a  good  motive  –  to  be  separate  from  compromise  and  
worldliness and to be a pure testimony for the Lord. But did they learn 
from the failures of the mainline denominations? No. 
God said to Judah through Jeremiah, “Israel is better than you!” That 
is  exactly  what  the  Lord  is  saying  to  many  of  the  “separated  assem-
blies” and their leaders today: “Some of the leaders in those mainline 
denominations are better than you leaders in the so-called separated 
assemblies.” Why do these newer leaders not learn a lesson? Because 
they say the same thing that Judah said, “What happened to others 
will not happen to us!” And so the new groups also backslide and go 
the same way.
But the Lord said, “I will bring a remnant back here.” That was another 
burden that these prophets communicated: “A remnant will return from 
Babylon”. The remnant would be those who “acknowledge their iniquity” 
(3:13).  The  Lord  said,  “I  will  take  you  one  from  a  city  and  two  from  a  
family, and I will bring you to Zion” (3:14). Zion here is a type of the true 
church of God. One mark of that church is that they have leaders who 
are  “shepherds  after  God’s  own  heart”  who  feed  God’s  people  with  the  
knowledge  of  God  and  with  an  understanding  of  His  ways  (3:15).  You  
can  know  that  you  have  come  to  Zion  when  you  have  found  leaders  
like that. And you can be sure that you haven’t found Zion when your 
church leaders are not like that. Godly leaders do not major on intelli-
gence, but on compassion and love for God’s people. They do not exploit 
God’s  people,  they  are  not  interested  in  people’s  offerings  but  in  their  
walk with the Lord.
Chapter 3:16, 17: “They will never say again, ‘The ark of the Lord,’ but 
they will talk about the throne of the Lord.” In other words, in Zion, they 
talk about the reality and not the symbols. This is the last time in the Old 
Testament that the ark of the Lord is mentioned. The Babylonian people 
took the ark away, and nobody has ever seen it since.
Chapter 4:3, 4: The Lord says to Judah, “Break up your fallow ground. 
Don’t sow among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord. Remove the 

A Call to Repentance                                                                                                                                385
Jeremiah
foreskins of your heart.” That is a call to humble themselves, be broken, 
confess their sins and stop depending on human resources.
Chapter 4:19: “My soul, my soul, I am in anguish. My heart is pound-
ing because I have heard the sound of the trumpet. The alarm of war.” 
Jeremiah sensed that the armies of Babylon were coming soon to take 
Judah  captive  and  that  disturbed  him  greatly.  Jeremiah  had  a  great  
burden in his heart because he loved the people. That’s why God made 
him a prophet. It is not enough that God touches our mouths to be His 
spokesmen to His people. He must also touch our heart so that we love 
them. Only then will we have a burden.
God then told Jeremiah something similar to what He told Abraham 
when Sodom was to be destroyed. Abraham had pleaded saying, “If there 
are ten people in Sodom will You spare the city?” God said, “Yes. If there 
are ten righteous people in Sodom, I’ll spare that city” (Genesis 18:32). 
And here the Lord said to Jeremiah, “If you find one righteous person (not 
ten  but  one)  anywhere  in  Jerusalem,  I  will  pardon  her.”  But  Jeremiah  
could not find even one. Can you imagine the condition of a city that does 
not have even one righteous person in it!
Do you know that one righteous man in a church can bring the blessing 
of God upon that church? One righteous man can bring the blessing 
of  God  upon  a  fellowship  and  into  a  home.  One  righteous  man  plus  
God  is  a  majority  anywhere.  Be  righteous  men  and  women  and  you  
will turn the tide against Satan wherever you go, for God will support 
you mightily.
Chapter 6:16: The Lord said, “Stand by the ways and ask for the ancient 
paths, where the good way is”. This is what the Lord is asking us to do 
even today. We must seek for the way that the apostles walked immedi-
ately after the day of Pentecost. That is “the good way.” But the men of 
Judah said they would not walk in it.
Chapter 7: There had been a so-called revival under King Josiah, just 
before Jeremiah appeared on the scene. But it was a superficial revival 
– just like many “revivals” today – that had not changed the people. The 
Lord told Jeremiah, to stand at the entrance of the temple and to tell the 
people, “Change your ways and don’t trust in deceptive words saying, ‘This 
is the temple of the Lord’ ” (verse 4). In other words, “God is not impressed 
with  your  religious  language,  if  there  is  no  change  in  your  ways.  If  you  
steal, murder, commit adultery, tell lies and worship idols and then come 
and stand before the Lord in His house, and say, ‘We are saved,’ is it to 
do all these abominations?” (verses 9, 10). Jesus quoted verse 11 saying: 
“Has this house which is called by My Name become a den of robbers?” 
(Matthew  21:13).  Now,  2000  years  later,  God  needs  prophets  who  will  
stand in the church and say the same thing: “Are you going to live in sin 
in your private life, be unrighteous in financial matters, and then come 

386 Through the Bible: God’s Last Warning to Judah
Jeremiah
into God’s house and say, ‘We are saved, we are eternally secure as God’s 
children?’ ” That is hypocrisy. The condition of God’s people today is the 
same as in Jeremiah’s day.
We  have  already  seen  the  two  streams  of  religiosity  and  spirituality 
originating from the time of Cain and Abel. Here we see religious people 
having  a  so-called  “revival”  that  does  not  deliver  them  from  sin.  Any  
revival that does not deliver people from sin is a superficial and worth-
less revival. These people were coming into the presence of the Lord and 
at the same time baking cakes to worship the queen of heaven as well 
(7:18).  In  Christendom  today  too,  there  are  millions  who  worship  one  
whom they call “the queen of heaven”. This “queen” is patterned after that 
idol “queen of heaven” that was worshipped in Jeremiah’s day. There is no 
queen in heaven. Jesus Christ is Lord there and He is all in all in heaven.
Jeremiah warned those people that if they went on playing the fool like 
this – then suddenly one day the harvest would be over and they would 
remain unsaved (8:20). That is a word that we need to proclaim to people 
today as well. The Lord has appointed a day when He will come to reap 
His harvest. Then it will be too late to respond to His word.
See  how  Jeremiah  wept  when  he  thought  about  this:  Chapter  9:1: 
“O that my head were waters and my eyes a fountain of tears that I might 
weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people.” Though 
Jeremiah  preached  such  hard  words  in  public,  he  wept  in  private.  All 
true prophets weep in secret for the sins of God’s people.
Chapter  9:23–24:  The  Lord  warns  wise  men  and  rich  men  here  not  
to boast in their wisdom or their riches. The prophets always preached 
against  people  who  were  proud  of  their  intelligence  or  their  wealth.  
There is only one thing really worth boasting about, and that is to “know 
the  Lord”  personally. “Eternal  life  is  to  know  God  and  Jesus  Christ” 
(John 17:3).
Jeremiah’s Conversations With God
Chapter  10:24:  Jeremiah  says,  “Correct  me,  O  Lord,  but  not  with  Your  
anger  lest  You  bring  me  to  nothing.”  That  is  a  good  prayer  for  all  of  us  
to pray.
Chapter 13:17: Again Jeremiah weeps. He says, “If you will not listen 
to  my  preaching,  my  soul  will  weep  in  secret  for  your  pride.  My  eyes  
will bitterly weep and flow down with tears....” Jeremiah is called “the 
weeping prophet”. He was a strong, bold man in public; But in secret, 
he wept just like Jesus wept over Jerusalem when the people there did 
not repent. Jesus never wept in public except at the tomb of Lazarus. 
But  He  wept  in  secret.  People  weep  only  when  they  have  a  burden.  If  
you don’t have any concern for God’s people you won’t weep. You won’t 
weep  when  somebody  else’s  child  is  dying.  You  cry  only  when  your  
own  child  is  dying.  Weeping  arises  out  of  concern  and  genuine  love.  

Jeremiah’s Conversations With God                                                                                                      387
Jeremiah
Jeremiah  genuinely loved God’s people. The Lord anoints and backs up 
only prophets like that.
Chapter 15:16–21: We see three conditions here to be a spokesman for 
God. 
• First of all: “Lord, I found Your words, and Your word has become for me 
the joy and delight of my heart” (verse 16). God’s word must be the joy 
and delight of your heart. Just like a businessman has joy in making 
money, your joy must be in getting into God’s word. Many want to be 
preachers today, who do not spend time digging into God’s word, and 
who don’t look at God’s word as the joy and delight of their hearts.
• Secondly: “I did not sit in the circle of merrymakers” (verse 17). When 
other people in Judah were partying and having fun, Jeremiah went 
away by himself to be alone with God. If you don’t discipline yourself 
to stay away from the jokers of this world, you can never be a spokes-
man for God. I am not saying that humour and clean jokes are wrong. 
But many Christians don’t know where to stop in such matters – they 
are perpetual jokers. Jeremiah made sure that he didn’t spend time 
with such people.
• Thirdly: Jeremiah made a complaint to God in verse 18 saying, “Lord, 
why  have  You  let  me  down?  You  have  been  to  me  like  a  deceptive  
stream,  like  unreliable  water.  I  come  to  the  stream  thinking  there  is  
water there and there is none. You have let me down.” The Lord said, 
“Don’t ever say things like that to Me.” the Lord rebuked Jeremiah for 
speaking words of unbelief (verse 19). God never lets us down. He is 
not like an unreliable stream. Jeremiah was depending on his feelings 
and looking at his circumstances. The Lord told him, “If you return to 
Me, and get rid of the habit of speaking worthless words (like the ones 
you just spoke – idle, useless words and words of unbelief) and ensure 
that you speak only precious words (of faith and goodness), then you 
will be My mouthpiece.”
How many of you want to be God’s mouthpiece? I am not talking about 
being a preacher of dead sermons that come from some book you read, 
but  being  God’s  spokesman.  If  you  want  to  be  that,  then  don’t  waste  
time in useless company, but redeem your time and spend it digging into 
God’s Word. Let that be your delight. Get rid of useless conversation and 
speak words of faith always and only good words in all your conversation. 
Then the Lord will make you His mouth. There is no partiality with God.
Then  the  Lord  told  Jeremiah:  “You  must  never  go  back  to  them.  You  
must influence them. Don’t let them ever influence you” (15:19 - Living). 
Don’t  let  the  world  influence  you;  and  don’t  let  corrupt  Christendom 
influence you. Don’t let backslidden pastors and money-loving preachers 
influence you. Let God influence you – and then influence others towards 

388 Through the Bible: God’s Last Warning to Judah
Jeremiah
godliness. God’s promise is that He will make us “a fortified wall of bronze 
such that people will not be able to prevail over us” (15:20). Hallelujah!
There  is  a  heavy  price  to  be  paid  to  be  God’s  servant.  In  Jeremiah’s  
case, part of that price was that he was to remain unmarried all his life. 
The Lord told him “You must not take a wife or have sons and daughters 
in this place” (16:2). Some like Paul and Jeremiah are called to a single 
life by God. They must be willing to accept that calling. Jeremiah was not 
even permitted to go into a house of mourning or into a house of feast-
ing (16:5, 8). Prophets had to discipline their eating habits if they were 
to  serve  the  Lord.  Can  you  imagine  what  people  said  about  Jeremiah?    
They must have remarked that he was a very unsocial person. He was an 
outcast in society because he didn’t have time to fool around like other 
people. He had to wait before God to get His message. Many people don’t 
want to pay that price but still want to be God’s spokesmen. Such preach-
ers not only don’t do any good to God’s people, they do a lot of harm.
Chapter 17:5–8 is a very blessed passage that tells us about trusting 
in the Lord and trusting in men. The Lord spoke through Jeremiah and 
to His people, “Cursed is the man who leans upon the arm of flesh. But 
blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord. He will be like a tree planted by 
the rivers of water. He will always bring forth fruit.” To trust in the Lord 
means to depend on the Lord fully, to lean upon Him, and not to trust in 
our own abilities or in any human source for help. God often uses men 
to help us but He wants us to depend only on Him. Such a man of faith 
will always produce fruit in his life. He will never be dry. He will always 
be fresh, any time you meet him, because his inner life is drawing water 
from the river of the Holy Spirit.
In Chapter  17:21–24,  Jeremiah  rebukes  those  greedy  people  who  
worked on the Sabbath day in order to make more money.
Chapter  18:  The  Lord  taught  Jeremiah  some  lessons  in  a  potter’s  
house,  from  the  way  the  potter  made  a  vessel  out  of  clay.  When  the  
vessel was spoilt, he made another vessel with the clay. This was a word 
of  encouragement  to  Judah.  The  Lord  could  do  that  with  them,  even  
when they had backslidden. And the Lord can do that for you too. Maybe 
your life has been spoilt because you did not respond to the Lord. Do you 
feel there is no hope for you? Read Jeremiah 18. There is hope for you. 
The Lord can still make you a vessel for His glory, if He can succeed in 
humbling you. Why was that vessel spoilt in the potter’s house? Because 
there were some hard lumps of clay there that wouldn’t allow the potter 
to crush it. If you allow God to break your hardness and pride, He can 
still make you a vessel for His glory.
Chapter  20:7–11:  Here  Jeremiah  complains  saying,  “Lord,  You  have  
never allowed me to speak a kind word to these people. It is always judg-
ment, judgment” (Living). Many like to get a reputation as being balanced 
in  their  preaching.  That  may  be  all  right  for  teachers.  But  no  prophet  
was ever balanced. The prophets were all imbalanced in their ministry. 

Christ and the New Covenant                                                                                                                 389
Jeremiah
They  had  a  message  from  God  and  they  kept  on  preaching  the  same  
message forever. Jeremiah preached the same message of judgement for 
40 years. In the Body of Christ too, God raises up prophets who have a 
particular burden. Other Christians may not have that burden. But the 
Lord gives a prophet very often a single burden. Then he must be true 
to  that  if  he  wants  to  remain  the  Lord’s  prophet,  and  not  allow  other  
well-meaning Christians to divert him into a more “balanced” ministry. 
The day he succumbs to that pressure and becomes “balanced”, he will 
cease to be God’s prophet to his generation. God gave Jeremiah a single 
message of judgement without one kind word to the people of Judah. And 
for 40 years he faithfully stuck to that task – and he was God’s spokes-
man until the end.
Many people tried to destroy him and denounced him (20:10). Even his 
close friends waited for his downfall. But Jeremiah was confident that 
the Lord would stand with him as a Great Warrior and that his perse-
cutors  would  therefore  stumble  and  fall  and  would  not  prevail  against  
him  and  would  end  up  in  everlasting  disgrace  (20:11).  The  Lord  stood  
by Jeremiah according to his faith and that was exactly what happened. 
That is how the Lord protects His prophets.
Christ and the New Covenant
Chapter 23:5, 6: Here we see Jeremiah prophesying about the coming of 
the Lord Jesus Christ who is called here ‘the Righteous Branch’ and ‘the 
Lord our righteousness.’ This title refers to the Lord as the One Who justi-
fies us by imputing His righteousness to us. It is a new-covenant title – and 
Jeremiah prophesied quite a bit about the new covenant. This chapter 
is also a wonderful chapter for all preachers to read, because there are 
many warnings given here for them to take heed to. False prophets are 
exposed and denounced here. They were false prophets because they did 
not take time to listen to what God was saying (23:18). They were too lazy 
to stand before God and wait for His Word. There are many false proph-
ets moving around in Christendom today, who seek honour and money 
for  themselves.  They  prophesied  falsely  about  imaginary  dreams  they  
claim to have dreamt. Jeremiah warns the people not to listen to them. 
They invented their own messages and spoke them saying “Thus says the 
Lord”. But the Lord hadn’t spoken to them. There are numerous people 
carelessly using that phrase even today. It is very dangerous to get up 
and say, “Thus says the Lord”, when you are not sure whether God has 
really spoken. People who have no fear of God whatsoever use that phrase 
today  and  say  whatever  comes  into  their  mind.  This  is  dangerous  and  
evil. I would recommend that all such people read this chapter and learn 
to fear God. God does speak. But he speaks through humble people like 
Paul who said, “I think I have the Spirit of God” (1 Corinthians 7:40) – and 
not through people who arrogantly say, “Thus says the Lord”. Beware of 

390 Through the Bible: God’s Last Warning to Judah
Jeremiah
such  false  prophets  –  for  there  are  thousands  of  them  in  Christendom  
today. God says that His word is like a fire and a hammer (23:29). Why 
are  the  words  of  so  many  preachers  unable  to  break  the  hard  hearts  
of people and set them on fire? Because their words did not come from 
the Lord.
Chapter  25:3:  This  is  midway  through  Jeremiah’s  ministry.  He  says  
that  for  23  years  he  had  prophesied,  but  the  people  of  Judah  had  not  
listened. But he still continued to prophesy faithfully that Judah would 
go into captivity for 70 years – and they did.
In Chapter 26:20–24, we see something of the sovereignty of God. There 
was  another  prophet  named  Uriah  at  that  time,  who  was  not  so  well  
known. He also prophesied the same message as Jeremiah did. When the 
king heard of it, he tried to kill that man (verse 21). Uriah heard of this and 
ran off to Egypt. But King Jehoiakim sent people to get him from Egypt 
and they caught Uriah and brought him before the king – and the king 
killed him. But God sovereignly protected Jeremiah. “Ahikam, the king’s 
secretary stood with Jeremiah and persuaded the court not to turn him over 
to the mob to kill him.” (26:24 - Living). Both these prophets were preach-
ing the same message faithfully. One was killed and the other escaped. 
This  is  something  like  what  happened  to  James  and  Peter.  James  was  
killed but Peter was freed (Acts 12). We may wonder why, at times, God 
permits  one  faithful  servant  of  His  to  be  killed  and  another  to  escape!  
This is because God has a different plan for each person. God’s planned 
ministry for Uriah was over. God’s plan for Jeremiah’s ministry was not. 
What we learn from this is that if you are a faithful servant of God, you 
don’t have to worry when people are trying to kill you. If God’s time has 
not yet come for you, He will preserve your life in one way or the other! 
You cannot be killed before God’s time. God gave Jeremiah favour with 
the king’s secretary and he saved Jeremiah’s life. The God of Jeremiah is 
our God too – and He will do the same for us as well!  Hallelujah!
In Chapters 29–33 we read about the restoration of Israel in the future 
and  about  the  new  covenant.  The  people  of  Judah  would  be  in  captiv-
ity for 70 years (29:10). This is the prophecy that Daniel read and was 
stirred by (Daniel 9:2, 3). And Daniel did what Jeremiah commanded in 
the  following  verses  (29:11–14).  The  Lord  said,  “You  will  seek  Me  and  
find Me when you search for Me with all your heart” (verse 13). The move-
ment of God’s people from Babylon to Jerusalem began when God found 
a  man  who  sought  Him  with  all  his  heart  (Daniel).  And  the  movement  
of God’s people today from spiritual Babylon to the spiritual Jerusalem 
(the true church) will also begin when God finds people who seek Him 
with all their hearts. Those who don’t seek God wholeheartedly will never 
find Him for He is a Rewarder only of those who diligently seek Him 
(Hebrews 11:6 - KJV). Jeremiah then named some of the false prophets 
and  warned  God’s  people  not  to  listen  to  them  (29:21–32).  He  was  not  
afraid of naming the false prophets.

The Fall of Jerusalem and Thereafter                                                                                                    391
Jeremiah
Chapter 31:3: Here is a beautiful word from the Lord to encourage us: 
“I  have  loved  you  with  an  everlasting  love.  Therefore  I  have  drawn  you  
with  loving-kindness.”  He  draws  us  to  Himself  not  because  we  deserve  
anything, but only because of His everlasting, unchanging love for us.
Chapter 32: Here we read of Jeremiah being imprisoned by the order of 
King Zedekiah. While he was in jail, the Lord told Jeremiah to buy a plot 
of land in his hometown. This was an act to demonstrate his faith in what 
the Lord had prophesied through him. Humanly speaking, it is the most 
foolish thing to do to buy a plot of land when a war is about to start and 
you know that the enemy is going to occupy the whole land. But Jeremiah 
bought this land with his own money to prove to the people that 70 years 
later God’s people would come back and in that day his relatives would 
be able to occupy this bit of land. He put his money down on something 
that would last after the period of judgement was over. This is similar to 
our putting our lives and our money down for God’s work when we gain 
nothing in this world by doing so. Humanly speaking, that is foolish. No 
shrewd businessman will put his money down for something that does 
not give him some earthly gain. But we do so, believing that we are going 
to reap eternal returns from our actions. Jeremiah expressed that faith 
in these words, “Lord, nothing is impossible for you” (32:17). He said that 
in relation to the purchase of this property. And the Lord answered him 
saying, “I am the Lord, God of all flesh. Is anything too difficult for Me?” 
(32:27). We sing those words in a chorus frequently, but I wonder if we 
are willing to act as Jeremiah did.
In Chapter 33:3, we see another wonderful promise of God: “Call unto 
Me and I will answer you. I will show you great and mighty things that you 
don’t know of.” What an invitation! We have to call upon God, if we are 
to experience the miracles that these prophets experienced. In 33:15, 16, 
we see yet another prophecy concerning the coming of Christ.
The Fall of Jerusalem and Thereafter
In Chapters 34–45, we read about the fall of Jerusalem. Jerusalem fell 
to the Babylonians. In the midst of that, we read a beautiful story about 
the  Rechabite  family  (Chapter  35).  The  Lord  told  Jeremiah  to  call  the  
Rechabite family into the temple and to offer them wine to drink. When 
he  did  that,  these  Rechabites  said  that  they  would  not  drink  it!!    They  
said  that  for  generations  their  forefathers  had  told  their  family  never  
to drink wine and they had obeyed that command for 200 years. What 
amazing  obedience!  The  Lord  then  said  to  Jeremiah,  “Here  is  a  family  
that  is  faithful  to  their  fathers  in  obeying  their  word.  But  Judah  does  
not listen to Me.” The Lord then promised the family of the Rechabites 
that they would always have the privilege of standing before Him (35:19). 
Even today, in the midst of many backsliders in Christendom, you will 
find one family like that standing true to God. Praise God for such fami-
lies that have been brought up in godly ways by their parents.

392 Through the Bible: God’s Last Warning to Judah
Jeremiah
In Chapter 36 Jeremiah was asked for the first time to write down some-
thing. The Lord told him, “Take a scroll and write this down” (verse 2). 
It is good for us also at times, to write down what the Lord speaks to us 
– for so often we forget them. When the king heard about that scroll, he 
ordered it brought to him. As soon as he heard a small portion of it, he 
got angry and cut it into pieces and threw it in the fire (36:22, 23). What 
did Jeremiah do then? (Remember that what the king destroyed was the 
book of Jeremiah that we have in the Bible today.) “Then Jeremiah took 
another scroll and dictated again to Baruch all he had written before, only 
this time the Lord added a lot more”!! (36:32 - Living). That is why we have 
52 chapters in Jeremiah! If the king hadn’t torn up the first scroll, we 
may perhaps have had only 36 chapters in the book of Jeremiah! That is 
how God turns the tables on Satan!!
In Chapter  38,  we  read  of  Jeremiah  being  thrown  into  a  well  full  of  
quicksand,  because  he  was  preaching  that  Babylon  would  come  and  
capture Judah – and the king and his officials did not like to hear that. 
Jeremiah sank into the mud and would have died soon. But again we see 
the sovereignty of God preserving the life of His servant. An African man 
named Ebed-melech went and spoke to the king and asked for permis-
sion  to  pull  Jeremiah  out  of  the  pit  and  pulled  him  out  and  saved  his  
life (38:6–13). God has his agents in the most unlikely places whom He 
uses  to  serve  His  faithful  servants.  And  because  Ebed-melech  helped  
Jeremiah,  God  promised  him  that  when  the  people  were  captured,  he  
would  escape  (39:16–18). God  will  not  forget  even  a  cup  of  cold  water  
given to help His servants.
Chapter 39:11–14: When Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem, he heard 
about Jeremiah and gave orders to his captain to look after him, and not 
to  harm  him  in  any  way,  but  to  do  for  him  “whatever  he  wants”.  It  is  
amazing to see how God gave His servant favour even before the world’s 
most powerful ruler of that time. God is the same today and He will do the 
same for His servants today as well. So Nebuzaradan, the captain, told 
Jeremiah, “I am freeing you. If you want to come with us to Babylon, I’ll 
look after you and treat you well. But if you don’t want to come, you can go 
wherever you like” (40:4). That heathen man appreciated God’s prophet 
more than the people of Judah did. The Greeks in Jesus’ day were eager 
to see Him, while the Jews crucified Him (John 12:20, 21). It has been 
like that throughout these 20 centuries. Christians have not appreciated 
sufficiently the prophets whom God has sent into their midst.
Jeremiah could have lived a comfortable life in Babylon. But he chose 
not to go, and stayed with the despised people of Judah. Later on, when 
they were planning to go to Egypt they told Jeremiah to find out God’s 
will for them, promising to obey whatever God said. When Jeremiah told 
them that the Lord wanted them to stay in Judah and not to go to Egypt, 
they  turned  around  and  told  him  that  God  was  not  speaking  through  
him (Chapters 42, 43). There we see the stubbornness of man who wants 

The Fall of Jerusalem and Thereafter                                                                                                    393
Jeremiah
preachers  to  preach  whatever  they  like  to  hear.  The  people  disobeyed  
God and went to Egypt and took Jeremiah with them. There Jeremiah 
prophesied against the temples of Egypt and he prophesied again to the 
Jews in Egypt. After that we don’t hear about him at all (Chapters 43, 44).
Baruch  was  the  man  who  was  writing  down  these  prophecies  of  
Jeremiah. The Lord then gave Baruch a warning through Jeremiah – a 
warning that we can all well apply to ourselves: “Are you seeking great 
things for yourself? Do not seek them” (45:5). We must not seek honour 
for ourselves in our ministry. Our calling is to be despised and rejected 
as our Master was. People like Nebuchadnezzar may appreciate us, but 
most of God’s people will never appreciate His true prophets.
In Chapters 46–51, we read a number of prophecies of judgement that 
the  Lord  gave  Jeremiah  against  a  number  of  nations  that  surrounded  
Judah  –  including  Babylon  the  world’s  super-power,  that  had  been  so  
kind to Jeremiah. A true prophet speaks the truth without fear or favour. 
In Chapter 48:10 (AMP), we read, “Cursed be he who does the work of 
the Lord negligently, with slackness and deceitfully; and cursed be he who 
keeps back his sword (tongue) from executing (proclaiming) the judgment 
pronounced  by  the  Lord”.  That  is  a  warning  that  all  of  us  should  take  
heed to.
Chapter 48:11 describes a person who “has been at ease from his youth, 
who has never been poured from one vessel to another and whose (selfish) 
scent has therefore not changed.” Many young people are like that. God 
is unable to break them in their younger days and so their scent never 
changes. They remain hard and stubborn and useless to God.
Finally, in Chapter 52, we read about the fall of Jerusalem.
Thus ends this marvellous book of a prophet who faithfully preached an 
unpopular message to God’s people without ever wavering for 40 years. 
He was a failure in man’s eyes but a tremendous success in God’s eyes.
May the Lord raise up many men like Jeremiah today.



LAMENTATIONS
The Weeping Prophet
L
amentations is the book that contains the lamentations of Jeremiah. 
The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters in it, and in this book, the first 
four  chapters  are  written  like  a  poem  with  the  verses  beginning  
with  different  letters  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet.  Psalm  119  and  Proverbs 
31:10–31 are other examples of this style of writing.
This book is the funeral song for Jerusalem. Jeremiah was weeping. 
He was lamenting that the streets of Jerusalem once bustling with people 
(1:1), now sat like a widow broken with grief and alone in her mourning. 
He identified himself with his people – and that is one of the important 
things we need to see in this book.
The Sad State of God’s People
Chapter 1:9: The people of Jerusalem defiled themselves with immorality 
with no thought of the punishment that would follow, like many of God’s 
people are doing today. They sin, not realising that one day they will have 
to answer to God for every single sin they ever committed.
Chapter 1:14: Here is how Jeremiah graphically describes the way the 
Lord judged Jerusalem. “The Lord took the sins of Jerusalem, wove them 
into  a  rope,  and  hitched  that  rope  to  a  yoke  of  slavery.  He  sapped  their  
strength and gave them to their enemies” (Living). It was their own sins 
that formed the rope that tied them to their captors.
Chapter  2:7:  “The  Lord  has  rejected  His  altar.  He  despises  the  false  
“worship” of His people. He has given them to their enemies.” The Lord 
despises  the  false  worship  found  in  Christian  churches  today,  when  
there is sin in the camp. The leaders themselves are living in sin. And 
so He has allowed His people to be enslaved by Satan.

396 Through the Bible: The Weeping Prophet
Lamentations
Chapter 2:9: “The law is no more and her prophets find no vision from 
the Lord”. This also is the condition we find in Christendom today. 
Chapter 2:11, 12: Jeremiah says that he has wept until he could weep 
no more. “I have cried until the tears no longer come. My heart is broken. 
Little children and tiny babies are dying in the streets. ‘Mama, we want 
food,’  they  cry,  and  they  collapse  upon  their  mothers’  breasts”  (Living).  
God’s servants today must weep for the poor, innocent people who are 
being  exploited  by  corrupt  Christian  leaders,  and  for  the  young  people  
who are being led astray by the bad examples of their leaders. We must 
stand against the wretched state of affairs in Christendom today.
Chapter 2:14: “Your ‘prophets’ have said so many foolish things false 
to the core. They have not tried to hold you back from slavery by pointing 
out your sins. They lied and said that all was well” (Living). What an apt 
description of the state of affairs in many churches today.
Chapter 2:19: And so Jeremiah exhorts the people, “Rise in the night 
and cry to your God. Pour out your hearts like water to the Lord. Lift up 
your hands to Him. Plead for your children” – a good exhortation for us 
today as well.
Chapter  3:22,  23:  “The  Lord’s  loving-kindnesses  never  cease.  His  
mercies are new every morning. Great is His faithfulness.” The phrase 
“His  mercies  are  new  every  morning”  means  that  every  morning  God  
looks at us as though we had never sinned before – if we have repented 
of all our past sins and confessed them to Him. He does not remember 
our sins any more. That is why He can look on us with new mercies 
every day. We must forgive others in the same way as God has forgiven 
us,  and  look  on  them  with  new  mercies  every  day,  not  holding  their  
past against them.
There is a good word for all young people in Chapter 3:27–33: “Submit 
to  the  yoke  of  discipline  when  you  are  young.  Humble  yourself  under  
the  authorities  God  places  over  you.  Put  your  face  in  the  dust  and  then  
there will be hope for you. When people strike you, turn the other cheek. 
(Jeremiah said that before Jesus did) For the Lord, even though He brings 
grief will also show you compassion.”
A Call to Return to the Lord
Here is another good word for all of us in Chapter 3:40: “Let us test and 
examine our ways and let us turn again in repentance to the Lord.”
Jeremiah  describes  how  the  Lord  protected  him  from  his  enemies:  
“My  enemies  whom  I  have  never  harmed,  chased  me.  But  I  called  upon  
Your Name, O Lord, and You heard me. You came and told me not to fear. 
O     Lord,  You  are  my  Lawyer.  Plead  my  case.  Be  my  Judge  to  prove  me  
right” (3:52–59). These words are an encouragement to us too to assure 

A Call to Return to the Lord                                                                                                                    397
Lamentations
us  that  the  Lord  will  be  our  Lawyer  and  Judge  to  defend  us  from  our  
enemies.
Chapter 4:2: Children of God who were worth their weight in gold once, 
have now become like earthen pots.
Chapter 5:21: “Restore us, O Lord, and bring us back to You again. Renew 
us  as  in  the  days  of  old.”  Jeremiah  was  a  man  who  not  only  preached  
to the people but also had a deep concern for their backslidden state in 
his heart. It is easy to get up and criticise people in our preaching. But 
what made Jeremiah great was his weeping behind the scenes for them, 
his concern and his burden. He rose up at night and prayed to God for 
them. I want to say this to all of you: If you want to serve the Lord, you 
must have a secret life like that before God. You must be concerned that 
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is being dishonoured in India today. If 
you weep before the Lord and cry out to him in the night hours because 
of your concern, you will find that He stands with you when you stand to 
proclaim His word in the pulpit.



EZEKIEL
The Departure and Return  
of God’s Glory
E
zekiel was a man who was greatly influenced by Jeremiah. He was 
in Babylon for at least 25 years. God had tried for more than 40 
years, through Jeremiah, to save the people of Judah from having 
to  go  to  Babylon  as  a  punishment.  But  they  had  not  listened  to  Him.  
Finally, the Lord said, “The best thing for you now is to accept My chas-
tening. You have to be punished. Submit to the king of Babylon and go 
to Babylon joyfully.”
God  does  not  want  to  chasten  us.  Jesus  never  had  to  be  chastened.  
Paul would never have needed a thorn in the flesh unless he was in 
danger  of  spiritual  pride.  Chastening  becomes  necessary  only  when  
God  sees  that  we  are  going  astray  or  have  gone  astray.  When  that  
happens, the best thing to do is to submit to His chastening.
So  God  said  to  Judah,  “If  you  go  to  Babylon  I  will  bless  you  there.  
Accept  My  chastening  and  discipline  for  70  years.”  Some  obeyed  God  
immediately and went, like Daniel and his three friends – and they were 
the  best  of  the  captives.  Some  who  sought  their  own  in  Judah  were  
later forced to go to Babylon. But even in Babylon, God gave them two 
 prophets – Ezekiel and Daniel. This shows God’s great love for His people 
even when they are being disciplined or in a backslidden state. God does 
not forsake us then, but still sends His prophets to speak to us.
God’s Unexpected Call to Be a Prophet 
Ezekiel was the son of a priest who was training to be a priest (1:3). But 
when he was 30 years old, God suddenly called him to be a prophet (1:1). 

400 Through the Bible: The Departure and Return of God’s Glory 
Ezekiel
We may plan for a certain ministry, but God may call us to something 
totally  different.  And  then,  we  must  be  willing,  like  Ezekiel,  to  drop  
everything and to accept whatever God calls us to.
The life of a priest is actually much safer than that of a prophet’s. Priests 
were not usually killed but the prophets invariably were. A prophet also 
has  a  very  tough  time,  because  not  only  does  he  suffer  at  the  hands  
of  the  people,  but  God’s  hand  also  is  heavy  on  him  most  of  the  time. 
Ezekiel would not have undergone all that, if he had been a priest. There 
are certain ministries in God’s kingdom that involve more suffering than 
others.  The  Lord  told  Peter,  “When  you  are  old,  someone  will  take  you  
where you won’t like to go” – indicating how Peter would suffer for the 
faith.  But  Peter  immediately,  pointing  to  John,  asked  the  Lord,  “What  
about  him?  Will  he  also  suffer  like  me?”  But  the  Lord  replied,  “That  is  
none of your business. You just follow Me.” (John 21:18–23). If God calls 
you  to  a  ministry  which  involves  suffering,  don’t  look  at  anybody  else.  
Don’t worry about whether they have an easy time or not. That is none 
of your business.
Ezekiel responded immediately. Thank God he responded. If he had 
not  responded  we  might  never  have  heard  of  him.  If  Hudson  Taylor  
had not responded when God called him to go to China, if C.T. Studd 
had not responded when God called him to go to Africa, if Jim Elliot had 
not responded when God called him to go to South America, we might 
never  have  heard  of  these  men.  But  they  responded  as  soon  as  God  
called them.
The thirtieth year seems to be a very significant time in people’s lives 
– both in the Old and New Testaments. Joseph was 30 when he became 
ruler in Egypt. David was 30 when he became king. Jesus was 30 when 
He  began  His  earthly  ministry.  Most  of  the  apostles  were  around  30  
when they began their ministry. And Ezekiel too was 30 when he began 
his ministry. Even today, it is probably around that age that God wants 
to begin to lead his children into the specific ministry that He has for 
them. But prior to that date, God has to spend many years in preparing 
us for that specific ministry. If you surrender to God totally and allow 
Him  to  prepare  you  during  your  teens  and  twenties,  then  you  can  be  
ready by the time you are 30 (or 35), for that specific ministry that God 
has planned for you. But a lot of young people are impatient and unwill-
ing to wait. I am not saying that you cannot go out and serve God before 
you are 30 years old. You can start serving God even when you are 16. 
But in your early years, God has to keep you under authority in order 
to guide you and protect you. But many young people chafe under such 
submission to authority and, as a result, are never broken and prepared 
for the ministry that God has planned for them. Even Jesus needed that 
training to submit to Joseph and Mary for 30 years before He entered 
into  His  ministry.  How  much  more  we?  Ezekiel  must  have  submitted  
to Jeremiah, in his younger days. He must have listened to Jeremiah’s 

Ezekiel’s Visions                                                                                                                                         401
Ezekiel
prophecies and studied them as a youth. God Who saw the faithfulness 
of this young man, decided that Ezekiel would be a prophet and not a 
priest.
One day, God opened the heavens over Ezekiel and gave him visions 
of Himself and a message for His people. “On the fifth of the month in the 
fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile, the word of the LORD came expressly 
to Ezekiel” (1:2, 3). God wants to speak to us all the time. But because of 
the limitations of our mind and its warping (caused by sin), we can hear 
His voice clearly only occasionally. Jesus was the only Person Who heard 
His Father speaking to Him continuously and clearly. Even the apostle 
Paul says in one of his letters that he was not sure whether what he was 
writing was from the Holy Spirit or not (1 Corinthians 7:12, 25, 40).
Nine times in his book Ezekiel records the date when God said some-
thing  specifically  to  Him  (1:2,  3; 24:1; 26:1; 29:1,  17; 30:20; 31:1; 
32:1, 17). It is good for us also to record the dates when God speaks 
something clearly to us. I have a written record with dates, of a number 
of statements that the Lord spoke to me specifically in my life. I look 
through them now and then to remind myself of what the Lord told me.
“The hand of the Lord came upon him” (1:3) is an expression that occurs 
seven times in Ezekiel. It meant that Ezekiel could not do what he wanted 
to do. It was like God saying to him, “Now, you have to go where I want 
you to go.” We can all live like this all our lives, if we want to, with the 
heavens  open  over  us  all  the  time.  That  will  be  easy,  if  you  allow  the  
hand of the Lord to be upon you, if you keep your conscience clean, if 
you humble yourself and fear of the Lord! At times, we are told that when 
the hand of the Lord was upon him, Ezekiel went “in the rage of his spirit” 
(3:14). He did not feel like going, but he went because he had submitted 
his life totally to God.
A true servant of God does not live by his feelings. It’s not a question 
of whether he feels like going, when God calls him to go. Those who serve 
themselves  live  by  their  feelings.  But  those  who  serve  God  go  whether  
they  feel  like  going  or  not.  They  move  because  the  hand  of  the  Lord  is  
upon them.
Ezekiel’s Visions
Ezekiel  then  describes  the  vision  that  he  saw.  Four  living  beings  came  
out  of  the  cloud,  each  having  four  faces  –  faces  of  a  lion,  an  ox,  an  
eagle  and  a  man  (1:5,  10).  We  don’t  know  exactly  what  these  meant  
to  Ezekiel,  but  we  see  something  similar  in  the  book  of  Revelation. 
These  faces  could  refer  to  character-traits  that  should  be  found  in  all  
of  God’s  servants  –  the  lion  symbolising  authority;  the  ox  symbolising  
service; the eagle symbolising heavenly-mindedness; and the man’s face   

402 Through the Bible: The Departure and Return of God’s Glory 
Ezekiel
symbolising  compassion.  These  are  all  characteristics  that  need  to  be  
found in all of God’s servants.
Then Ezekiel saw some wheels within wheels on the earth that moved 
in the same direction as the spirit of these four living beings (1:15–20). 
Each  wheel  had  a  second  wheel  within  it  that  turned  crosswise,  like  a  
gyroscope. These wheels are a picture of the sovereign working of God in 
the  circumstances  that  we  come  across  on  earth  –  circumstances  that  
seem to go in one direction sometimes and in another direction at other 
times. These circumstances may appear to us to be haphazard and unre-
lated, but God is sovereignly working in all of them to fulfil His purposes. 
The Holy Spirit controls the circumstances of our life. The total and abso-
lute  sovereignty  of  God  over  all  circumstances  on  earth  (whether  the  
wheels are going north, south, east or west) is one of the most important 
things that we need to believe in, in these last days. Wherever you go, 
you will find the sovereign working of our God – whether in the north, 
the south, the east or the west. Notice too the obedience of these living 
beings – “they ran like bolts of lightning” (1:14).
Jesus told us to make disciples in all nations based on His absolute 
authority: “All authority in heaven and earth is given to Me. Therefore go 
and  make  disciples  of  all  nations”  (Matthew  28:18,  19).  Today  that  has  
been changed by preachers to read, “People are dying in sin. Therefore 
go into all nations.” But that is not what Jesus said and that is one of 
the  main  reasons  for  a  lot  of  shallow  evangelism.  It  is  on  the  basis  of  
Christ’s total authority that we must go. For example, if someone like me 
(who has a teaching ministry) feels that there is a great need for a teach-
ing ministry in many places and therefore decides to go here, there and 
everywhere teaching Christians, I will very soon become a nervous wreck 
like many other Christian workers. But I don’t do that. I say, “Lord, You 
have authority in all heaven and earth. You have told me to go and make 
disciples. I’ll do that – but tell me where to go.” In other words, I operate 
under His authority. That is the way to serve the Lord. Then you find that 
all your circumstances work only for your very best. But if you wander 
everywhere, doing whatever you like to do, you may find that many things 
do not work for your good. God’s perfect plan will not be fulfilled in your 
life. So what we see here is a picture of a life led by the Spirit. That is the 
truly spiritual life. It speaks of the rims of the wheels being “full of eyes”. 
This  speaks  of  “the  eyes  of  the  Lord  moving  to  and  fro  throughout  the  
whole earth supporting His wholehearted servants” (2 Chronicles 16:9).
Chapter  1:26–28: Ezekiel then saw a figure on a throne surrounded 
by  a  radiance  like  a  rainbow  shining  through  the  clouds.  The  rainbow  
symbolises  God’s  covenant.  There  are  two  things  that  we  must  always  
remember  when  we  serve  the  Lord  –  one  is  God’s  sovereignty  over  all  
circumstances and the other is God’s covenant with us through Christ. 
God  has  made  an  everlasting  covenant  with  us  through  the  blood  of  
His  Son.  He  has  promised  us,  “I  will  never  leave  you  nor  forsake  you” 

A Man Under Authority                                                                                                                           403
Ezekiel
(Hebrews 13:5). That is the basis on which we go forward to serve Him. 
We  don’t  go  on  the  basis  of  human  need,  although  we  look  at  it.  We  
don’t live in fear of human governments or their rules and regulations. 
We  move  forward  under  the  sovereignty  of  God,  believing  that  we  are  
His covenant people. It is so important in these days to remember these 
fundamental principles.
A Man Under Authority
Chapter 2: What we see here is a man who is totally under God’s author-
ity. The Lord said to him, “Stand up. I want to speak to you.” The Spirit 
came into him as God spoke and set Ezekiel on his feet. The Lord said, 
“Listen  carefully.  I  am  sending  you  to  the  nation  of  Israel.”  As  we  wait  
upon God, though we may not hear an audible voice like Ezekiel did, it 
is  possible  to  have  just  as  real  and  as  certain  a  sense  of  calling  and  a  
sense of God sending us as Ezekiel had. It may take time. When I started 
my ministry, I did not know immediately what my ministry was going to 
be. But as the years went by I began to discover what it was. Now as I 
look back, I find fulfilment. But I know so many people who have tried 
to drag me away from the ministry God had called me to. The Lord says, 
“I am sending you with a particular ministry.” It is very important that 
you learn to wait upon God and hear what God is speaking to you and 
what  He  has  called  you  for.  Sometimes  you  can  choose  God’s  second  
best. I remember a time, more than 40 years ago, when my wife and I 
were in a lot of financial difficulty, having very little money, a Christian 
organisation invited me to be its director, and offered me a good salary, 
a free car, free telephone, free house, etc. if I accepted their offer. It was 
a rich American organisation ministering the gospel in India. I said, “No. 
I can’t do that because even though I am in need, God has not called me 
to sit behind a desk and be an administrator. God has called me to go 
around preaching the Word.” I am so thankful that I did not accept their 
offer. It was a temptation – not a temptation to sin, but to choose some-
thing  God  had  not  called  me  to.  When  I  look  back  now,  I  can  see  that  
if I had accepted their offer, I may still have been engaged in Christian 
ministry, but not in the ministry that God had planned for me. So from 
these  examples  of  the  servants  of  God  in  the  Bible  that  we  have  been  
considering, I want you to realise that God has a specific task for you. It 
is wonderful to realise that truth when you are young. Wait on the Lord 
and say, “Lord, show me Your perfect plan for me.” It won’t become clear 
in one day. But over a period of years, it will become clearer and clearer. 
And as it becomes clear to you, stick to it at any cost – and you won’t 
have any regret when you stand before the Lord in the final day.
The  Lord  then  told  Ezekiel  some  things  that  are  very  important  for  
those  who  are  called  to  a  preaching  ministry  to  remember.  The  first 
thing God said was, “Don’t be afraid of them” (2:6). This word occurs very 

404 Through the Bible: The Departure and Return of God’s Glory 
Ezekiel
frequently: “Don’t be afraid even though their threats are sharp as thorns, 
barbed like briars, and even though their threats sting like scorpions. Don’t 
be dismayed by the dark scowls on their faces.” (2:6). Israel scowled at 
Ezekiel when he prophesied, and threatened to kill him. Every prophet 
has faced such opposition. But God stood by those prophets and He will 
stand by you if your calling is to speak to people like this. The confidence 
of these prophets was in the sovereignty of God.
The Lord told Ezekiel, “You must give them my messages whether they 
listen or not” (2:7). Even if they don’t listen, they will recognise one day 
that a prophet had come to them. Once the message is given, the proph-
et’s  responsibility  is  over.  But  if  he  didn’t  give  the  message,  then  their  
blood would be on his hands.
In Chapter 3, the Lord told Ezekiel to eat the scroll He gave. The message 
which we give others must first be eaten and digested by us first. God’s 
Word  was  sweet  as  honey  in  his  mouth.  In  the  book  of  Revelation  too,  
the Lord told John to first eat the scroll (Revelation 10:9). Only then were 
Ezekiel and John permitted to prophesy.
This is a fundamental principle in all ministry of the Word. The Word 
which God desires to speak to others through you He wants to speak to 
you first of all. God’s Word challenges preachers with questions such as: 
“You who preach that one should not steal, do you steal?” (Romans 2:21). 
When you speak evil about someone, you are stealing his reputation. Do 
you recognise that as stealing, or do you recognise only stealing money 
as stealing? “You who preach that others should not commit adultery, do 
you commit adultery?” Do you lust with your eyes? We must eat the scroll 
ourselves first, if God is to anoint our ministry. Most preachers today are 
preaching without first eating the scroll themselves. That is why their 
ministry is so dead and boring. If you want an effective ministry, eat the 
scroll first. The word of God is like a two-edged sword – the first edge 
must cut me, and only then can I use the other edge to cut others. If it 
doesn’t cut us first, we will be hard and unmerciful in our preaching to 
others. So eat the scroll. 
Chapter  3:14:  “The  Spirit  lifted  me  up  and  took  me  away  and  I  went  
in  bitterness  and  turmoil.  The  hand  of  the  Lord  upon  me  was  strong.” 
Sometimes when the Lord tells us to go somewhere, we may not be as 
excited in our feelings about going, as at other times. There may be feel-
ings of turmoil in our hearts. But we still obey and go. Paul speaks in 
2  Corinthians  7:5  of  “conflicts without and fears within”  him.  Paul  had  
some fears; but he still went where he had to go. He didn’t go by his feel-
ings. If we go by our feelings, we will never go where the Lord wants us 
to go. Many years ago, I was waiting at the railway station in Bangalore 
to take a train to go to a small town for a weekend of meetings. My chil-
dren were all small and some of them were sick and my wife had to look 
after them all by herself. I wondered whether I should cancel my trip and 
go home to help my wife. The Lord spoke a word to me at that time that 

A Man Under Authority                                                                                                                           405
Ezekiel
was like a fresh revelation. He gave me freedom to make my own choice 
but said, “Whatever you do, never take a decision on the basis of fear.” I 
learned a lesson that day – never to move on the basis of fear. I didn’t go 
home. I took the train and went for my ministry. The Lord took care of my 
children. I entered into a solemn covenant with the Lord long ago. I told 
Him, “Lord, You take care of my family, and I will take care of yours” – and 
He has done a far better job than I have done.
I am not asking any of you to make such a covenant or to do what I did 
that night at the railway station. There may be times when you should 
stay at home and help your wife. But, whatever decision you take, take 
it  always  in  faith,  and  never  out  of  fear.  There  may  be  times,  when  in  
faith you may have to say, “I will trust God to take care of the ministry in 
that place. Right now it is more important for me to help my sick wife at 
home.” Then go home – and God will be with you. But there may also be 
times when the devil will try to frighten you and thus prevent you from 
fulfilling a ministry God has appointed for you. So don’t ever go by feel-
ings. Remember that sometimes when the Spirit lifts us up and takes us 
away, we may have to go with turmoil in our hearts. But we still go! 
Chapter 3:23: “So I got up and I saw the glory of the Lord just as I had 
seen it first. And I fell with face down in the dust.” Here is another impor-
tant principle of ministry: Put your face in the dust always. Sometimes 
it is good to do that actually – physically. Lie down on the floor in your 
room before God and say, “Lord, this is where I rightfully belong. This is 
what I am – a nobody in your eyes.” We who stand in front of others and 
preach are in great danger because so many people admire us and exalt 
us. More than anybody else, we are the ones who need to get alone before 
the Lord frequently and to lie down flat before Him and recognise that we 
are nothing in His eyes.
God  can  take  away  our  breath  in  a  moment.  He  can  take  away  our  
anointing in a moment. I fear to lose the anointing more than anything 
else in my life. I would rather lose all my money and all my health than 
lose the anointing of God upon my life. It is easy to lose the anointing by 
being  a  little  careless  with  money  or  with  our  tongue  or  in  some  other  
small matter. When Ezekiel’s face was in the dust, the Spirit came into 
him and set him on his feet. There – in the dust before God – is where the 
Spirit will fall upon us. Let Him then lift us up and exalt us. Never exalt 
yourself.
Chapter 3:24–27: “He talked to me and said, ‘Go shut yourself in your 
house.  There  you  will  be  bound  with  ropes  so  you  cannot  go  among  the  
people. I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so you won’t 
be able to speak. Whenever I give you a message I’ll loosen your tongue 
and let you speak. And then tell them, “This is what the Lord says.” Some 
will listen and some will ignore you. It doesn’t matter.’ ” It’s wonderful to 
live like this before God! When God tells us not to go, we don’t go. When 
He tells us not to speak, we don’t speak. The Lord will tell you when to 

406 Through the Bible: The Departure and Return of God’s Glory 
Ezekiel
speak and when to keep quiet. Do you listen to the Holy Spirit, or do you 
listen to your reason? Reason may say that it is always right to speak; 
but he who listens to the Spirit knows that there is a time to speak and 
a time to be silent. Sometimes we are called to keep quiet. Jesus never 
said a word to Herod (Luke 23:9). Learn to live by the promptings of the 
Spirit. This is what we can learn from Ezekiel. He was a man who lived 
by the leading of the Holy Spirit.
Chapter 4: The Lord taught Ezekiel through a number of signs. He first 
asked him to make a clay tablet and then to lie down on one side for 390 
days and then to lie down on the other side for 40 days. Ezekiel was to 
be an object lesson to the people of Judah who were in Babylon, showing 
them  how  God  was  punishing  Jerusalem  and  the  people  of  Israel  and  
Judah. He was a living demonstration of his message.
The Lord asked him to do some strange things like cooking food with 
dung,  shaving  his  head  and  beard,  and  keeping  just  a  little  bit  of  that  
hair with him, to show that only a few people in Israel would be saved 
(4:12–15; 5:1–4). If you become a prophet, you will have to forget about 
your  good  looks!!  If  God  tells  you  to  shave  your  head,  you  will  have  to  
shave  your  head.  You  can’t  say,  “Well,  Lord,  that  won’t  make  me  look  
nice.”  He  had  to  cook  his  simple  food  on  dung.  It  would  have  been  far  
easier for Ezekiel if he had been a priest. But as a prophet, he had to be 
disciplined  in  his  eating  habits  and  disciplined  about  his  appearance.  
He could not be bothered by what people thought about him. He had to 
please only God.
So  don’t  ever  complain  about  your  appearance  or  your  food  to  God,  
if you want to be His servant. Accept whatever God gives you and obey 
whatever He tells you to do. God has sovereignly determined every little 
thing in your life. When I was 23 years old, I was preaching God’s word 
regularly. I had also started losing my hair at that time. I felt there must 
be some good reason why God allowed that. And as I thought about it, 
I found a reason. When people saw my receding hairline, they imagined 
me to be at least 30 years old – and so they were more prepared to listen 
to me, than if they had known that I was only 23! So I saw that God had 
a purpose even in something as small as that!
If  you  are  totally  sold  out  to  God  from  your  youth  and  say  to  Him,  
“Lord, I am not interested in my food or appearance or anything. I want 
to be filled with Your Holy Spirit and anointed to serve You. And I want to 
be true to that anointing until the end of my life. I don’t want to follow the 
example of other preachers. I want to look at Jesus. And I want to look 
at the example of these prophets. I want to follow you wholeheartedly” 
–  I  can  assure  you  that  you  will  have  a  very  exciting  life.  God  Himself  
will teach you His word and speak to your heart. He will give you words 
to speak to other people. But you must be totally sold out to Him. You 
must have no ambition or desire on earth – for honour, or acceptance, 
or money, or anything. Everything you have must be God’s, your body,

Ezekiel
your time, your money, your family, everything. If you are willing to be 
like that, there is no limit to what God can do through you.
Why God’s Glory Departed
Chapter  7:9:  We  see  a  title  of  the  Lord  here  that  many  people  may  not  
like to hear: ‘The Lord the Smiter,’ the One who punishes with judgement.
In Chapter 8, the Lord showed Ezekiel the idolatry that was going on 
inside  the  temple  which  was  why  He  had  forsaken  Judah.  God  gave  
Ezekiel  an  insight  into  the  secret  sins  that  were  going  on  in  the  midst  
of God’s people. God will give a true prophet words to expose the secret 
sins among His people that others do not know about. In 1 Corinthians 
14:24,  25,  we  read  of  a  church-meeting,  where  when  people  speak  
prophetically, a total stranger walks in and finds the secrets of his heart 
being  revealed  to  him.  And  he  falls  on  his  face  and  acknowledges  that  
God is in that meeting. This is how every church-meeting of ours should 
be. And all of us should covet to prophesy like that.
The  people  were  worshipping  idols  and  the  women  were  weeping  for  
the  idol  Tammuz  which  involved  engaging  in  many  filthy,  licentious 
rites  along  with  the  heathen  (8:14).  And  all  this  was  being  practiced  
in  the  temple.  Much  of  this  idolatry  was  not  evident  to  people  on  the  
outside. Many people who look holy on the outside are quite filthy on the 
inside. The Lord was saying, “This is supposed to be My temple, and see 
what  is  going  on  inside.”  They  were  facing  eastwards  and  worshipping  
the sun, just like many Christians today face east in order to say their 
prayers (8:16).
Chapter 9:3: Because of all this sin in God’s house, the glory of God 
began to slowly depart from there. When the glory of God begins to depart 
from  a  person  or  a  church,  and  the  anointing,  the  freshness  and  the  
fire have gone, there is always a reason. Many preachers who had an 
anointing 20 years ago have lost it now. The anointing on our life should 
increase as we grow older. But with most of the preachers I have met in 
India,  I  have  only  seen  it  decrease.  This  is  usually  because  they  have  
corrupted themselves through the pursuit of money, or compromised in 
some other way, or begun to speak to please the people. God may have 
called many of you to serve Him. If so, then be faithful and don’t let the 
glory depart from your ministry. 
Chapter 9:4: Here is a word that we could apply to the church today, 
in this way: “Walk through the churches and put a mark on the foreheads 
of  those  who  weep  and  sigh  because  of  the  sins  being  committed  in  the  
church.” If God were to send an angel today (as He did then) to put a mark 
on the forehead of those who are weeping because the name of Jesus is 
being dishonoured in the church, how many people would be marked? 
How concerned have you been that the name of Jesus is being dishon-
oured in India by Christians? That sacred Name is dishonoured in most 

408 Through the Bible: The Departure and Return of God’s Glory 
Ezekiel
of the churches in our land – in churches of every denomination. Are we 
concerned  about  that?  God  marks  out  people  who  are  concerned.  And  
here the Lord said, “Kill all those who don’t have My mark.” Even today, 
all those who have no concern for the Lord’s Name will end up spiritually 
dead. “Hallowed be Thy name,” is the first prayer that the Lord taught us 
to pray. If you have a concern for that Name, then God can use you to 
fulfil His purposes.
As the angel began to kill people, the seventy elders were killed first! 
The elders who were supposed to be the leaders of God’s people were the 
ones who had the least concern of all. To whom much is given, much is 
required. So when judgement begins, it will always begin with the leaders 
in the church. The glory of God was departing because the leaders had 
failed. It is the same today.
Chapter 11:1: Again the Spirit lifted Ezekiel up and took him to another 
part  of  the  Lord’s  house  and  told  him  to  prophesy.  There  he  saw  the  
glory of God finally leaving the city altogether. It is interesting to see how 
slowly  the  glory  departed.  The  anointing  of  God  departs  from  a  person  
and a church very slowly. God does not act in haste. But when someone 
deliberately  continues  in  sin,  then  God  acts.  The  glory  of  God  finally 
went to the Mount of Olives, on the east of Jerusalem (11:23). The glory 
had departed now. But one day it would come back as we see in Chapter 
43:1–4. The Mount of Olives was where Jesus ascended to heaven from. 
One day, He will come back in glory and arrive on the same mount. In 
that day, the glory of God will fill the earth as the waters cover the sea. 
While  Ezekiel  was  prophesying,  one  of  the  evil  leaders  named  Pelatiah  
who  had  been  “devising  sin  and  giving  evil  advice”  (11:2)  suddenly  fell  
down dead (11:13) – just like Ananias died in Acts 5.
Chapter  11:15–17  (Living):  “The  remnant  left  in  Jerusalem  are  saying  
about your brother exiles: ‘It is because they were so wicked that the Lord 
has deported them. Now the Lord has given us their land!’ But tell the exiles 
that the Lord God says: ‘Although I have scattered you in the countries of 
the world, yet I will be a sanctuary to you for the time that you are there, 
and I will gather you back from the nations where you are scattered and 
give you the land of Israel again.’ ” The people in Babylon were the ones 
who went there in obedience to God. The people in Jerusalem were the 
ones who had stayed back, disobeying the Lord. The Lord told Ezekiel to 
comfort the exiles with the promise of his presence and blessing. Those 
who disobey God may appear for a time to have many earthly comforts. 
But  in  the  long  run,  it  will  be  seen  that  only  those  who  obey  God  are  
truly blessed. The people in Jerusalem thought, “Because the temple is 
in Jerusalem, God is here and he cannot be with those who have gone 
to Babylon.” Today also there are many Christians who have separated 
themselves from the mainline denominations (calling them ‘Babylon’) and 
have gathered together in “separated assemblies” imagining that they are 
the true ‘Jerusalem’. They also imagine that God is with them and not

Ezekiel
with the other groups. But the tragedy is that God is with neither group, 
for there is just as much corruption in the so-called “separated assem-
blies” today, as there is in the dead denominations. Christians in both 
groups are pursuing after money, and there is just as much strife and 
church-politics in one group as in the other. God won’t be with you just 
because you came out of a dead religious system. No. He watches to see 
if you are humble and broken, whether you keep your conscience clear, 
and whether you are free from the love of money and earthly honour, etc. 
False Prophets Denounced
Chapter 13:3: Here the Lord rebukes the false prophets who deceive the 
people with “visions” that they claim to have seen. Destruction is certain 
for  such  false  prophets  and  false  prophetesses  (13:17).  Then  the  Lord  
rebukes people who have idols in their hearts who come seeking to find 
God’s  will  through  a  prophet  (14:1–3).  False  prophets  will  readily  give  
advice to such people because they get paid for it!! God Himself deceives 
such false prophets to do so: “If a prophet is deceived and gives a message 
anyway, it is because I the Lord have deceived that prophet” (14:9). Why 
does  God  allow  these  false  prophets  to  be  deceived?  2  Thessalonians  
2:10, 11 gives us the answer: Because they do not love the truth so as to 
be saved from sin. When God shows you your sin, if you are not willing 
to acknowledge it honestly and you don’t want to be saved from it, then 
God will allow you to be deceived. He will allow you to believe falsehoods, 
and thereafter you will live in a delusion for the rest of your life. This is 
what has happened to many Christians. If God asks you to apologise to 
someone  (perhaps  younger  than  you),  and  you  don’t  do  what  He  says,  
you are in great danger of being deceived. God is a God of truth and when 
people don’t love the truth, He allows them to be deceived. This is a very 
serious warning to all who do not love the truth.
Chapter 14:14: Here God says that when a country sins against Him, 
“even if Noah, Daniel and Job were there, they would only be able to save 
themselves.” It is interesting to see that God could praise a young man 
like Daniel, even when Daniel was alive – for Daniel was in Babylon at 
that time!! And he was much younger than Ezekiel. What a humble man 
Ezekiel was to appreciate a much younger man. It’s very rare to find 
servants of God today who can appreciate godliness in a younger person.
Chapter 16 is a lovely chapter that pictures God’s love for us and can 
be looked at as symbolic of our salvation. God found us when we were 
in  sin,  unwashed  and  naked.  He  washed  us,  and  clothed  us  with  the  
righteousness of Christ and then married us. But we have often not been 
faithful to Him. 
In 16:49,  50,  God  describes  the  real  sins  of  Sodom  that  led  to  the  
destruction of that city (in Genesis 19). Most of us have always associated 
Sodom with sodomy (homosexuality) and other sexual sins. But sexual 

410 Through the Bible: The Departure and Return of God’s Glory 
Ezekiel
sin was the ultimate result of a way of life. What was it that led them into 
such  depths  of  evil?  Here  we  are  told  that  Sodom’s  sins  were  actually  
pride, laziness, gluttony (love of good food), and neglecting the poor and 
needy. That was why God wiped out that city. It is interesting to note that 
God does not even mention their sexual sin.
Sexual sin in Sodom was the result of their lazy, comfortable life-style. 
What can we learn from this? That there is a close connection between 
pride and sexual sin, between laziness and sexual sin, between glut-
tony and sexual sin, and between lack of concern for other people and 
sexual sin. Consider just these four areas. Many of you who are young 
have to admit that you are finding it very difficult to overcome your 
sexual passions. That is an extremely difficult area. But why not begin 
by overcoming in these four easier areas? You may find it easier then 
to overcome in the sexual area. Begin first of all, by humbling yourself 
in all situations. Avoid all arrogance. Then begin to be hard-working 
and diligent in whatever you do. Then try fasting – avoiding food – once 
in a while. And fourthly, begin to think a little more about the needs of 
people around you and see how you can help them. Try this prescrip-
tion for one year and you may discover that overcoming your sexual 
passions becomes easier. We cannot overcome any sin without grace 
from God – but He gives His grace only to the humble; and He helps 
only those who are kind and helpful to others.
Chapter 18: There is a very important verse here that can help remove 
any  confusion  in  our  minds  concerning  “generational  curses”.  “What 
do you mean by using this proverb ‘The fathers eat the sour grapes but 
the  children’s  teeth  are  set  on  edge’  ”  (18:2).  The  people  were  saying  
that some children were suffering because of the sins of their parents. 
That is believed even today by many non-Christians and by Christians 
too  who  do  not  know  their  Bibles.  The  false  prophets  in  Israel  were  
 misinterpreting Exodus  20:5  and  bringing  people  into  bondage  and  
painting a picture of an unrighteous God Who punished children for 
the  sins  of  their  ancestors.  But  the  Lord  replied  to  that  by  saying,  
“You  are  surely  not  going  to  use  this  proverb  in  Israel  any  more.  The  
soul who sins will die” (18:3, 4). The Lord made this clear 2500 years 
ago.  Yet,  there  are  well-known  Christian  preachers  today  who  teach  
that  Christians  can  suffer  because  their  ancestors  worshipped  idols  
or engaged in witchcraft. They say that a curse that was on someone’s 
great grandfather can come down to him; and he will have to get rid of 
it by having it cast out. Such teaching is absolute nonsense!
When we give our lives totally to Christ, we are cut off from our ances-
try  (and  the  tree  of  “Adam”)  and  grafted  into  another  tree  –  “Christ”. 
Whatever curses we may have inherited from our forefathers are broken 

False Prophets Denounced                                                                                                                     411
Ezekiel
the moment we are grafted into Christ. Now there is no more curse for us, 
but only “every spiritual blessing in heavenly places in Christ” (Galatians 
3:13, 14; Ephesians 1:3). If your great grandfather worshipped idols or 
practised witchcraft, that cannot affect you in any way, once you have 
surrendered  your  life  to  Christ.  If,  however,  you  have  not  given  your-
self totally to Christ, then anything can happen. But once you are truly 
grafted into Christ, there cannot be any curse on you. Christ cannot be 
cursed and you are a part of Him. Yet there are many Christians today 
who believe this false teaching that they can be cursed. Christ became a 
curse for us on the cross, so that the blessing of God might come upon 
us. It is true that the children of ungodly parents may suffer physically 
and materially, in many ways. If a man is a drunkard, his children may 
suffer  because  there  isn’t  enough  money  at  home  for  their  needs.  But  
there  won’t  be  any  curse  on  the  children  because  of  the  sins  of  their  
father. The children will not be punished for their father’s sins. Everyone 
is punished for his own sin. This is what the Lord made clear to Ezekiel. 
So don’t allow any preacher to frighten you or to bring you into bondage 
through false teaching.
In Chapter  22:30,  the  Lord  says,  “I  searched  for  a  man  among  them  
who should build the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, 
but I found none.” Even today the Lord is seeking for men and women 
who will build the wall of separation from the world in His church and 
who will stand in the gap (a gap caused by the distance between two 
of God’s children who cannot fellowship with each other) and pray for 
peace and fellowship to be restored.
In Chapter  23,  we  read  about  the  apostasy  of  the  two  sister-nations  
Israel  and  Judah.  Both  became  “prostitutes”.  The  older  one  (Israel)  
symbolises the mainline churches. The younger one (Judah) symbolises 
the  “separated  assemblies”.  Both  have  become  spiritual  harlots.  Both  
are backslidden. Just because you have changed your pattern of church 
government, and no longer have priests and bishops, does not mean that 
you have become spiritual. The new wineskin is different from the new 
wine. We must learn lessons from the failure of Judah who always said, 
“We are better than Israel.” Ultimately they ended up in the same pit of 
captivity that their sister fell into.
Chapter 24: Here we read of part of the price that Ezekiel had to pay for 
his ministry. His wife died suddenly. The Lord had told him, “Your wife 
is going to die but you must not weep or shed any tears. Don’t accept any 
food brought to you by your consoling friends” (24:16, 17). As a prophet, 
he was under the hand of God and had to obey. There are many legiti-
mate things that others can do that prophets may not be allowed to do. 
If you are a servant of God you have to live by a totally different set of 
standards than the rest of the world. 

412 Through the Bible: The Departure and Return of God’s Glory 
Ezekiel
One interesting thing we see here is the intimate, loving relationship 
that Ezekiel had with his wife. We can see this in the way God refers to 
her  as,  “the  desire  of  your  eyes”,  “your  dearest  treasure”,  “your  lovely  
wife”, “the delight of your life”, and “the person you love most” (24:16 - in 
various translations). Ezekiel was not an ascetic, but a great lover of his 
wife,  even  though  he  was  a  prophet.  Can  you  honestly  say  about  your  
wife, “She is the desire of my eyes, my dearest treasure, the delight of my 
life and the person I love the most.” That is the way that all of us must 
look at our wives, at all times.
Judgement on the Nations
Chapter  26:2:  Here  we  read  of  the  city  of  Tyre  rejoicing  over  the  fall  of  
Jerusalem.  Tyre  had  been  jealous  of  God’s  blessing  on  Jerusalem,  but  
now  she  rejoiced  because  Jerusalem’s  destruction  would  mean  greater  
business opportunities for Tyre and thus greater wealth for her too. So 
God warns Tyre that she is going to be destroyed too. This is a warning 
to all those who rejoice over the fall of others. “Do not rejoice when your 
enemy falls” (Proverbs 24:17).
In Chapter 28:11–19, we read of “the ruler of Tyre”. Satan is the ruler 
of all the heathen kings of earth and so he was the real ruler behind the 
human  ruler  of  Tyre.  In  this  chapter,  we  see  God  speaking  at  times  to  
the human ruler of Tyre and at times to Satan who indwelt him. This is 
similar to what we do when dealing with a demon-possessed person – at 
times we speak to the person and at times to the demon that is possess-
ing him. Here we read that Satan was first in the original garden of Eden 
(verse 13). This was the Eden that existed before the destruction of the 
earth mentioned in Genesis 1:2, and is different from the re-created Eden 
that we read of in Genesis 3. As the head of the angels, He was perfect 
in beauty, blameless in every way, wiser than Daniel and anointed when 
he was created (28:3, 12, 14, 15). But he became proud of his God-given 
abilities  and  immediately  became  the  devil  (28:17).  We  saw  an  earlier  
description of his fall in Isaiah 14. Pride is still his master-weapon with 
which he destroys men and women today.
In Chapters 29 to 32, we read a number of prophecies of judgement on 
Egypt and Pharaoh.
In Chapters 33 to 39, we read messages of hope for the future concern-
ing the restoration of God’s people.
Chapter 33:1–16 speaks of a watchman’s responsibility to warn people 
about what he has heard from God and of the people’s responsibility to 
respond to God’s warnings.
Chapter  34  is  a  chapter  that  all  who  are  shepherds  and  pastors  of  
God’s people should read and meditate on, to be warned and challenged. 
God exposes here the carelessness, the greed and the self-seeking atti-
tude of Israel’s shepherds – something that is alas true of many Christian 

The New Covenant Life and the Church                                                                                               413
Ezekiel
leaders and pastors today as well. The Lord finally says, “I will feed My 
flock Myself” (34:15). He then promises that we will “be showers of bless-
ing” to others around us (34:26).
The New Covenant Life and the Church
Chapter 36:25–37 is a beautiful prophecy of new-covenant life. This is a 
description of the Christian life, as God intends it to be. He first promises 
to cleanse us thoroughly, removing all idols from our heart, and then to 
remove our hard heart and to replace it with a soft one, and then to put 
His Holy Spirit within us and then to make us walk in His ways and cause 
us to obey His commandments and thus to save us from all our unclean-
ness (36:25–29). But all this can happen only when we pray to God and 
ask Him to do it for us (36:37). If we don’t ask for this life, we won’t get it. 
And when we come into this glorious life, we “will loathe ourselves in our 
own sight” (36:31), as we think of our past life. This is one of the primary 
marks of a Spirit-filled man that he detests himself for all the sin he sees 
in his flesh and cries out saying, “O  wretched  man  that  I  am.  I  am  the  
chief of sinners” (Romans 7:24; 1 Timothy 1:15). A Spirit filled man does 
not see any sin in others before he sees the same sin within his own flesh 
and he loathes himself for it. The closer we get to God, the more aware 
we become of our own sin.
Chapter 37 is a parable of resurrection life. God took Ezekiel to a valley 
full of dry bones and told him first of all to prophesy to them. The Word of 
God went forth and the bones came together and flesh covered them. But 
they  needed  something  more  than  just  the  Word  of  God  –  they  needed  
the  Holy  Spirit’s  power  as  well,  just  as  we  saw  in  Genesis  1.  There  we  
saw  that  it  was  the  joint  operation  of  the  Word  of  God  and  the  Holy  
Spirit  that  brought  life  out  of  death.  It  is  the  same  here,  and  it  is  the  
same  even  today.  When  the  Holy  Spirit  came  upon  these  dead  bodies,  
they stood up and immediately became a powerful army of soldiers for 
the Lord. This is a picture of what God wants to do in the church today. 
Many Christians are initially exactly like those dry bones, stiff and dead, 
despite the correctness of all their doctrines. As they respond to the Word 
of God, they begin to gather together as Christians (bone comes together 
to bone), and they begin to live decent lives (There is a certain amount of 
beauty when the flesh covers the bones). But there is one more thing that 
these Christians need if they are to be a mighty army for God. They need 
to be endued with the supernatural power of God’s Holy Spirit. That is 
the message of Chapter 37.
Chapters 38 and 39 speak of Gog, the ruler of Magog – the northern 
enemies of Israel who will attack Israel in the last days just before Christ 
returns and who will be defeated at the battle of Armageddon. 
Chapters 40 to 48 are a picture of new-covenant life and of the church. 
This is pictorially described as a temple. Our body is the temple of the 

414 Through the Bible: The Departure and Return of God’s Glory 
Ezekiel
Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19) and the church is also the temple of God 
(1 Corinthians 3:16). In Chapter 43, we read of the glory of God that had 
left the temple returning to the new temple – the new covenant church 
that was established from the day of Pentecost onwards. The Lord calls 
the church “the place of My throne” (43:7). The law for this new covenant 
church is described thus: “Its entire area shall be Most Holy” (43:12). In 
the old covenant temple, only a small room at its western end was called 
“Most  Holy”  –  where  God  dwelt.  But  in  the  new  covenant  church,  the  
entire church (temple) is Most Holy. To build the church as God’s temple 
today, we must follow this one fundamental law – absolute holiness for 
every member in it. Sin must not be tolerated in any form in anyone. 
In Chapter 44:9–19, the Lord speaks of two types of ministers in His 
temple – symbolised by the sons of Zadok and the Levites. The sons of 
Zadok  symbolise  the  wholehearted  disciples  of  Christ  who  are  permit-
ted  “to  minister  to  Him”.  The  Levites  symbolise  the  compromisers  who  
are permitted only “to minister to the people”. There is a vast difference 
between  these  two  types  of  ministries.  Jesus  never  served  the  people  
primarily.  All  His  service  was  done  to  the  Father  alone,  even  when  He  
served  people  –  and  that  is  how  we  must  serve  God  too.  It  is  when  we  
begin to serve the people that temptations to compromise and to please 
people enter in.
From such a holy temple (Spirit-filled church or Spirit-filled individ-
ual) a trickle of water begins to flow out that becomes a river and finally 
becomes  many  rivers  (Chapter  47).  This  is  the  passage  which  Jesus  
quoted in John 7:37–39, where He spoke of “rivers of living water flowing 
out” from a man who is filled with the Holy Spirit. This is what began on 
the day of Pentecost and has been flowing through godly men and women 
ever since. This life begins as a little trickle before it becomes a big river 
and many rivers. 
In Chapter 47:3–6, the Lord gave Ezekiel a little taste of what it means 
to live a Spirit-filled life. He led Ezekiel step by step into this river. After 
walking in it for about 500 metres the water reached Ezekiel’s ankles. After 
another 500 metres, it came up to his knees. After another 500 metres, 
the water came up to his waist. And after yet another 500 metres, it was 
so deep that Ezekiel had to lift his feet off the ground and be carried by 
the current of the river. We can go forward in our walk with God continu-
ously as Ezekiel did; or we can stop at some point. God will never compel 
us to go further than we want to. When Elisha followed Elijah (2 Kings 2), 
he continually tested Elisha to see if he was hungry for more or satisfied 
with what he already had. Because Elisha was not satisfied until he got 
God’s best, he got a double portion of the anointing upon his life. We see 
Ezekiel also being tested here in a similar way. He also wanted to enter 
into the river more and more until he had entered into “waters to swim 
in”. You can experience a measure of the Holy Spirit’s workings in your 
life and still stop at some point that is less than God’s best.

The New Covenant Life and the Church                                                                                               415
Ezekiel
Notice this also: When the water was up to Ezekiel’s ankles, or up to 
his knees, or even up to his waist, his feet were still on the ground. But 
it  is  when  our  feet  are  taken  off  from  the  earth,  that  we  know  that  we  
are really filled with the Spirit. At that point, we are “detached from the 
earth and from earthly interests and from attachment to material things” 
and we begin to be “led by the Spirit, according to the will of God and not 
our own will”.
The last verse of the book (48:35) mentions the name of this new cove-
nant  church  as,  “The  Lord  is  there”  –  Jehovah  Shammah. This  is  the  
primary mark of a new-covenant church: The Lord is present in its midst 
at every meeting – and people meet with Him and hear Him. This is the 
church that you and I are called to build. But to build it, the Lord needs 
people like Ezekiel who will obey Him totally.



DANIEL
Restoration Begins with a Man
D
aniel is a book that has a special relevance for times of persecution. 
It shows us how a man of God should conduct himself in times of 
persecution.
We  also  see  here  the  beginning  of  the  movement  from  Babylon  to  
Jerusalem  –  symbolically,  from  corrupt,  compromising  Christendom  
to God’s new covenant church. It began with one upright, uncompro-
mising man, who was concerned about God’s purposes and who fasted 
and prayed for their fulfilment. Daniel  never  knew,  when  he  started  
out being faithful as a young man, what a tremendous ministry he was 
going to have. He just remained faithful to God in little things and big, 
and God accomplished a great ministry through him. He was probably 
around 17 years old when the book begins, and about 90 years old by 
the time the book ends. He lived through the entire 70 years of captiv-
ity, and he was faithful all the way through. That was why God could 
use him to begin this movement from Babylon to Jerusalem.
One Uncompromising Man
The building of a pure church for God in any place always begins with 
one man who has a burden of prayer, and who carries that burden before 
God frequently saying, “Lord, I want a pure church in this place for You, 
and I am willing to pay any price for it.” You must be willing to carry that 
burden before God again and again in prayer. You may have to carry it 
for a long time. I had to carry that burden for about ten years before I 
saw the beginnings of a new covenant church. God will test your faith-
fulness. Just like a mother carries a baby in her womb, we have to carry 
this burden in our hearts. That was how Daniel carried this burden in 
his heart. This resulted in others also beginning to share his burden in 

418 Through the Bible: Restoration Begins with a Man
Daniel
later  years  –  Haggai,  Zerubbabel,  Joshua,  Zechariah,  Ezra,  Nehemiah  
and others. God Himself will add others to you who share your burden, 
and  together  with  them  you  will  be  able  to  build  God’s  new  covenant  
church. Daniel was too old to go back to Jerusalem at the age of 90, to 
build the temple. But he stood behind the scenes and prayed and started 
the ball rolling.
Daniel lived in a heathen land. So he is an example especially for us in 
India, as to how we can stand for God in a non-Christian land without 
compromising our Christian principles. He could gather only three whole-
hearted people, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah (who are better known 
by  their  Babylonian  names  –  Shadrach,  Meshach  and  Abednego).  But  
those young men were a powerful witness for God right in the middle of 
Babylon, the capital city of the world’s superpower – a small church of 
four people. Those four people influenced that country more than all the 
other hundreds and thousands of Jews who were in Babylon because of 
one reason: While the others compromised, these four did not.
Don’t  think  that  you  can  influence  a  village  or  a  country  by  large 
numbers of Christians. Four people who stood for God influenced the 
most powerful country in the world and its rulers. The message that 
comes through that is, “It is not by numbers, nor by human might, but 
by His Spirit that God does His work.” God is looking for men who are 
upright and who will never compromise.
One of the keywords in the Book of Daniel is “vision”. God needs men of 
vision. That word occurs about 40 times in this book. I also want you to see 
two phrases that describe Daniel’s attitude to God and to man. The first 
phrase is “The Lord gave” (1:2) – referring to Nebuchadnezzar’s capture 
of Jerusalem. Daniel saw the Lord as the One Who gave Nebuchadnezzar 
victory  over  Jerusalem,  to  teach  the  Jews  a  lesson.  So,  Daniel’s  atti-
tude  towards  God  was  one  of  faith  in  God’s  absolute  sovereignty  over  
all matters on the earth. The second phrase is “Daniel made up his mind 
not to defile himself” (1:8). Daniel’s attitude towards man was one of “No 
compromise whatsoever”.
These are the two attitudes that we must have too, in times of perse-
cution.  Even  if  a  heathen  king  who  doesn’t  know  God  is  in  control  of  
a country, let us remember that it is the Lord who has given him that 
position.  It  is  the  Lord  Who  allows  someone  to  win  an  election  or  a  
war and to rule a country. Nebuchadnezzar did not know God, but God 
still controlled him. The rulers of our country also may not know God. 
But  if  God  has  people  like  Daniel  in  our  land,  He  can  accomplish  His  
purposes there. And when we are tempted to compromise, or invited to 
compromise or when we see other Christians around us compromising, 
that is when we must stand unflinchingly for the Lord and refuse to 
bend even slightly. We must refuse to defile our conscience with any sin. 

One Uncompromising Man                                                                                                                     419
Daniel
If we have fallen somewhere, we must confess our sin immediately, have 
it  cleansed  in  Christ’s  blood,  apologise  to  the  people  concerned  where  
necessary and set things right. But we will not compromise at any cost. 
We  will  not  seek  to  please  any  man.  We  will  not  seek  to  please  any  
Nebuchadnezzar or any of his authorities. We will submit to them if they 
rule our country, but we will not compromise our convictions even if we 
have to lose our lives. 
After Daniel made up his mind to keep himself undefiled, his first test 
came in relation to food. The first test that came to Adam and Eve was 
also in relation to food. And the first test that came to Jesus in the wilder-
ness was in relation to food too. What will your attitude be to tasty food, 
if that involves compromise of God’s principles? Esau lost his birthright 
because of food. Isaac lost his spiritual vision because of his love for the 
tasty  food  that  Esau  could  bring  him.  But  Daniel’s  attitude  was,  “God  
has said in His Word that this type of food must not be eaten and so I will 
not eat it.” Daniel had studied the Scriptures as a young man, and he 
knew that the law of Moses forbade the eating of certain meats and that 
the book of Proverbs forbade the drinking of alcoholic wine. He decided 
to obey God, whatever it may cost him.
In  the  beginning  he  had  to  stand  alone,  while  all  the  other  Jews  
compromised. But when Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah saw one young 
man taking a stand for God, they got the courage to join him (1:11). If 
Daniel had not taken a stand for the Lord, we might never have heard 
about Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
I find that there are three types of people among God’s children: First, 
the compromisers who seek what is good for them and have no prin-
ciples. There are millions of such people in Christendom today. Then 
there is a second group like Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah who don’t 
have the courage to take a stand on their own, but who are willing to 
take a stand if they see someone else who is willing to take a stand for 
the Lord. That is a much smaller number. Then there is the third group 
of people like Daniel, who will take a stand for the Lord, even if no-one 
else takes a stand. This group is very much smaller. There may be just 
one person here and another person there, in this category. This divi-
sion is somewhat like the outer court, the holy place and the most holy 
place in the tabernacle.
I believe that there are a number of people like Hananiah, Mishael and 
Azariah in India, who want to take a stand for God, for a pure testimony 
for  the  Lord  in  their  locality,  but  who  don’t  have  the  courage  to  stand  
on their own. They are looking for a Daniel to be their leader. And when 
a Daniel comes into that village or that town, then these Christians will 
come  and  join  him.  But  if  a  Daniel  never  comes  to  their  place,  these  
people will live and die without ever being a testimony for the Lord.

420 Through the Bible: Restoration Begins with a Man
Daniel
So  the  great  need  in  our  country  is  for  Daniels.  God  is  looking  for  
Daniels who will determine in their heart never to defile themselves. And 
when  these  Daniels  take  a  stand  for  the  Lord,  they  will  automatically  
draw the Hananiahs, the Mishaels and the Azariahs to them. I have seen 
this  happen  in  so  many,  many  places  in  India.  God  looks  for  a  Daniel  
first. If He cannot find a Daniel, then nothing will happen. God is looking 
for men who will not seek their own, who are not interested in anything 
for themselves and who are willing to lose their lives for Him if necessary. 
Daniel was only 17 years old. Even today, God can choose a 17-year-old 
youth and make him a prophet and empower him to take a stand for Him. 
The other three men may have been older than Daniel; but they submit-
ted to him, because they recognised him as a God-appointed leader.
Faith in God’s Power
Daniel also had faith. He told the king’s overseer, “You can test us for ten 
days. We will have only vegetables and water. And we believe that we’ll 
be  physically  better  off  than  these  other  Jews  who  are  eating  the  rich  
food.” God is looking for people who will boldly confess their faith, and 
not keep their light hidden underneath a bed. At the end of ten days, just 
as Daniel had said, they all looked healthier and stronger than the others 
(1:11–15). This self-denial in a simple matter like food prepared them for 
the greater tests of the fiery furnace and the den of lions later on.
Here  we  see  how  God  gave  them  supernatural  health  for  their  body. 
Later, we read how God gave them supernatural intelligence for their 
mind.  He  gave  these  four  young  men  a  special  aptitude  for  learning  
literature and science. God gave Daniel supernatural understanding in 
his spirit too, to understand the meaning of visions and dreams. So we 
see God enabling them supernaturally in body, soul and spirit. We also 
need to learn to trust God to give us health for our body, intelligence 
for our mind and spiritual vision and understanding of his ways by the 
Holy Spirit.
In Chapter  2,  we  read  about  a  dream  that  Nebuchadnezzar  had.  
Nebuchadnezzar  called  his  wise  men  and  told  them,  “Tell  me  what  I  
dreamt and its meaning.” Those wise men are a picture of preachers who 
have no touch with God, but who are deceivers. Such preachers cannot 
interpret God’s word or the times correctly. Those wise men said, “Only 
the gods can show you what you dreamt. No human being can do that. 
It is impossible. But if you tell us the dream, then we will interpret it for 
you.” Now, we know that if someone tells us his dream it is easy to cook 
up an interpretation and to pretend that we got it from God! That’s what 
a lot of preachers do today. But Nebuchadnezzar was a shrewd man. He 
said, “If you all are really in touch with God, you will be able to tell me 
the dream as well.”

Faith in God’s Power                                                                                                                                 421
Daniel
A  true  servant  of  God  will  experience  some  supernatural  things  in  
his  ministry.  If  you  are  truly  anointed  by  God,  you  will  have  some  
supernatural experiences. You may go to a place where you don’t know 
anyone,  and  you  preach  God’s  word  there.  And  that  word  will  be  so  
exactly  according  to  the  need  of  some  people  sitting  there  that  they  
will think that somebody had come and told you about their problems. 
It is this element of prophecy that we need to have in our ministry. We 
must seek for it if we are to have it. The Bible commands us, “Earnestly 
desire to prophesy” (1 Corinthians 14:1).
When  Daniel  heard  about  this  problem,  he  was  calm.  He  handled  
the situation with great wisdom (2:14). Here was a young man who had 
great wisdom! Do you have to make mistakes when you are young? No. 
Some  people  say  that  young  people  will  have  to  make  many  mistakes.  
Daniel  didn’t.  We  don’t  read  in  the  Scriptures  of  a  single  wrong  thing  
that Daniel did in his entire life. He was a unique man like Joseph – who 
was another young man about whom almost nothing wrong is recorded. 
Why not make these young people your examples and say, “Lord, I don’t 
have to do foolish things like other young people do. I want to follow the 
examples of these men who lived in humility and the fear of God right 
from their youth.”
But I must admit that it is very rare to find such young people. Most 
young people that I know do a lot of foolish things – mainly because they 
won’t submit to their elders. They imagine themselves to be very clever, 
and  thus  end  up  doing  a  1001  foolish  things.  That  is  the  hard  way  to  
learn. But there is a better way. If you humble yourself and live in the 
fear of God and submit to authorities God places over you, you can learn 
from your youth without doing the foolish things that others do. Daniel 
is a wonderful example of that.
How  did  Daniel  get  the  answer  to  the  dream  that  Nebuchadnezzar  
had? First of all, he had faith that God would reveal it to him. He went 
to  God.  He  called  his  friends  (2:17).  There  is  a  tremendous  value  in  
fellowship in prayer when we face a problem that is too difficult for us. 
Daniel understood the principle of fellowship in prayer. He was a new 
covenant man living in old covenant times. His attitude was, “Let me 
not pray about this all by myself. Let me get my three brothers to join 
me and let us pray together.” And they prayed together.
In 2:18,  we  read  that  they  prayed  to  the  “God  of  heaven”,  indicating  
that Daniel and his friends began their prayer by exalting and praising 
the “God of heaven” first of all. This is how Jesus also taught us to begin 
our prayers: “Our Father Who art in heaven...” (Matthew 6:9), whereby we 
exalt God first, before bringing our requests to Him. Beginning prayer 
with exalting God was Daniel’s habit, as we can see in Chapter 9:4 also. 
And this is the habit of every godly man.

422 Through the Bible: Restoration Begins with a Man
Daniel
It is a good habit to begin every time of prayer with praise. Whenever 
you can’t get through in prayer, start praising the Lord. Think of God’s 
greatness and praise Him – and you will find the atmosphere clearing up 
immediately.
And when God answered their prayer, they gave Him all the glory and 
said, “Praise the Lord for His sovereignty. He is the One who determines 
the course of all events in the world. He is the One who removes kings and 
sets others on the throne. He is the One who gives wisdom to the wise and 
knowledge  to  the  scholars.  He  is  the  One  who  reveals  deep  and  myste-
rious things. We thank and praise You, God, because You have given us 
wisdom and strength” (2:20, 23 - Living).
Once  God  had  revealed  the  dream  and  its  meaning  to  Daniel,  he  
went  and  gave  the  king  the  answer,  acknowledging,  “This  is  not  due  to  
my clever ness. It is because God revealed it to me” (2:30). Daniel was a 
humble young man who was willing to give God all the glory. God reveals 
His truths to such men.
Nebuchadnezzar saw a statue with a head of gold, chest and arms of 
silver, stomach and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of a combination 
of iron and clay (2:31–33). The head of gold symbolised the Babylonian 
empire  that  would  last  for  about  70  years.  After  that  would  come  the  
Medo-Persian empire (chest and arms of silver) which would last for about 
200 years. The belly and thighs of bronze symbolised the Grecian empire 
of Alexander the Great (and his father) which would last for about 200 
years.  The  legs  of  iron  represented  the  Roman  empire  (that  would  rule  
the world in the time of Christ) and that would last for about 600 years. 
The  feet  of  iron  and  clay  represent  countries  governed  by  dictatorship  
(iron) and democracy (clay), and represent the nations of the world in the 
last days. The ten toes of the feet speak of ten kingdoms that will come 
together at the end-time (possibly in Europe) that will be headed by the 
Antichrist, immediately before the return of Jesus to earth.
So God gave Nebuchadnezzar a vision of what was going to happen on 
earth right until the return of Christ. Then he saw a stone coming down 
and shattering all these kingdoms to bits. This was a picture of the reign 
of Christ (2:44). “The God of heaven will then set up a kingdom which will 
never be destroyed.”
An Uncompromising Remnant
So  when  Nebuchadnezzar  made  a  statue  entirely  of  gold,  what  he  was  
saying thereby was, “I am going to be there until the end. There won’t be any 
silver, bronze, or iron kingdoms after me!! His pride made him so foolish 
that  he  thought  he  would  live  until  Jesus  returned.  Nebuchadnezzar  
represents man in all his haughtiness.
Chapter  3:1:  Here  we  read  that  Nebuchadnezzar  compelled  everyone  
to  worship  his  golden  statue.  Daniel  was  obviously  not  in  town  at  this  

An Uncompromising Remnant                                                                                                               423
Daniel
time.  He  must  have  been  away  somewhere  in  relation  to  his  work.  So  
Shadrach,  Meshach  and  Abednego  were  by  themselves.  All  the  Jews  
disobeyed God’s commandment and bowed down to the idol to save their 
lives. God had allowed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to be by them-
selves at this time to test them and to strengthen them.
At times it is good for us, if a man of God is not available nearby, so 
that  we  can  learn  to  depend  on  God  Himself.  The  danger  of  having  
godly men nearby is that we tend to lean on them. The danger of always 
listening to a good Bible teacher is that we may never study the Word 
ourselves. So it is good if you don’t have a fantastic Bible teacher with 
you all the time. That will make you more dependent on the Holy Spirit 
to teach you His word and to strengthen you to live the Christian life.
So God in His sovereignty ensured that Daniel was not there at this time. 
And Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego passed the test. Nebuchadnezzar 
was furious when they refused to bow before his statue and said “If you 
don’t bow down, I will heat the furnace seven times and throw you in” 
(3:19). They still did not bow down. I can imagine that some of the other 
Jews would have come to them and said, “Just compromise a little. Just 
nod your head a little towards the statue.” But they steadfastly refused 
to do so. The other Jews may even have suggested, “Why don’t you bow 
down, and then go to God and ask Him to forgive you for doing it.”
There are Christians who do that today and think they are being clever. 
They do something wrong and then go to God and ask Him to forgive 
them. They tell lies to get admission in a college or to get a visa or a 
job. They think they are clever because they get what they want and 
then get their sin forgiven too. But if you get an admission or a visa or a 
job by telling a lie, you cannot possibly end up in the place where God 
wants you to be – for it can never be God’s will for you to get anywhere 
in His will, by telling a lie. And you will then have problems wherever 
you may be. You must refuse to compromise if you want God’s best. 
And if, as a result, you lose something, God will make that loss work 
for your good.
We need disciples of such boldness and integrity in India today. Daniel 
was like that himself, and he taught Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego 
to be like that. It was better to have 4 people like that in Babylon than 
400 compromisers who ate what the king gave them, bowed down to his 
idols, and also claimed to believe in Jehovah. The sad situation in India 
today is that we have a multitude of Christians who are such compro-
misers. God is looking for Daniels, Shadrachs, Meshachs and Abednegos 
who will stand for Him without compromise in this day of compromise.

424 Through the Bible: Restoration Begins with a Man
Daniel
We also see here the total contempt for death that these three men had. 
They told the king, “Our God is able to deliver us from your fiery furnace. 
But if He chooses not to do so, we will still not worship your image.” 
What was the result? When they were thrown into the furnace, only 
the ropes got burnt. When Satan harasses us, what can he burn up in 
us? Only the things that bind us!! He cannot burn up anything valua-
ble in us. When we are thrown into the fire, the things that bind us get 
burnt and we come out free. It is good if a fire has succeeded in freeing 
you from attachment to earthly things. We could see Shadrach, Meshach 
and Abednego here as a picture of ourselves tied to earthly things with 
ropes. Then God puts us into a fire (some difficult trial) and very soon 
our attachment to the things of earth is gone. Thank God for such fires. 
Thank God for such trials.
If I were to ask you what the greatest miracle in Chapter 3 was, you 
would probably say, “That the fire could not kill them.” But I see the 
greatest miracle here as this, that when everybody bowed down to the 
statue,  these  three  men  did  not.  I  remember  seeing  a  picture  many  
years ago, of this 90 feet high statue with thousands of people down 
on their faces worshipping it and three people standing up. And I said, 
“Lord, make me like that. When everybody around me is compromis-
ing, help me to stand out and be different, even if I have to die for it.” 
Keep that picture before you always.
Chapter  4:6,  7:  Nebuchadnezzar  again  had  a  dream  that  frightened  
him. He called the wise men again. 32 years earlier when he had his first 
dream,  the  wise  men  couldn’t  help  him.  Only  Daniel  could  help  him.  
But  he  went  back  to  the  wise  men  again.  And  of  course,  they  couldn’t  
help  him  this  time  either.  Daniel  explained  this  dream  too  and  told  
him  how  God  was  going  to  judge  him.  “The  tree  is  a  picture  of  you,”  
Daniel said, “and because of your pride God is going to cut you down.” 
But Nebuchadnezzar did not listen to Daniel. Daniel urged him to stop 
sinning,  to  do  what  was  right,  to  break  from  his  wicked  past  and  to  
be  merciful  to  the  poor,  so  that  this  dream  of  judgement  would  not  be  
fulfilled (4:27). But Nebuchadnezzar wouldn’t listen.
A  year  later  (4:29)  Nebuchadnezzar  was  walking  on  the  roof  of  his  
palace in Babylon and he began to meditate on what he had built. Here 
was Babylon built by him, by his power and for his glory (4:30). By man, 
through man and to man – that is the essence of Babylon. When a church 
is built with human wisdom, by human power, and for human glory, that 
becomes  Babylon,  even  if  its  doctrines  are  all  correct.  When  Christian  
work is done by human cleverness and ability, by the power of money, 
and  for  man’s  glory,  then  whatever  doctrines  the  leaders  may  believe,  
what they build will be Babylon. A genuine work of God is always done 
according  to  God’s  plan  that  is  discovered  through  waiting  on  God  in  

Daniel’s Continued Faithfulness                                                                                                             425
Daniel
prayer.  It  is  done  by  the  power  of  the  Holy  Spirit  –  with  supernatural  
help from God; and it is done 100% for the glory of God. Remember this 
always and it will save you from building with wood, hay and straw.
God warned Nebuchadnezzar three times (4:31). He did not listen, and 
so  he  was  punished.  He  became  mad  and  started  eating  grass  like  a  
cow  (4:32).  At  last  he  repented.  Then  God  healed  him  of  his  madness.  
Nebuchadnezzar then made one of the most complete statements about 
the sovereignty of God found anywhere in the Bible. He said, “His domin-
ion is an everlasting dominion and His kingdom endures forever. All the 
inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing and He does according 
to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth. No 
one can ward off His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’ All His 
works are true and His ways are just and He is able to humble those who 
walk in pride” (4:34–37).
This  is  what  makes  me  believe  that  Nebuchadnezzar  is  probably  in  
heaven  today.  For  if  he  lived  according  to  that  faith  that  he  expressed  
until the end of his life, he would have entered God’s kingdom. Isn’t it 
interesting  that  Solomon  who  wrote  three  books  of  Scripture  is  in  hell  
and Nebuchadnezzar could be in heaven!
Daniel’s Continued Faithfulness
Many years later, Nebuchadnezzar’s son Belshazzar had a great feast in 
Babylon. He suddenly saw someone’s hand writing words on the wall of 
the palace (5:5). There are only two instances in the Bible where we read of 
God actually writing something. The first is His writing the ten command-
ments on tablets of stone. The second is here. None of the wise men could 
interpret  what  was  written  on  the  wall.  When  the  queen-mother  heard  
of this, she reminded the king of Daniel who had interpreted dreams in 
the days of Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel was brought in and the king offered 
him purple robes and a gold chain and a place of honour in the kingdom. 
Daniel  told  the  king  to  keep  his  gifts  or  to  give  them  to  someone  else  
(5:17). Daniel’s attitude to gifts and honour from the heathen was exactly 
the  same  as  that  of  Elisha  (who  refused  Naaman’s  gifts)  and  Abraham  
(who refused the gifts offered by the king of Sodom).
A genuine man of God can be identified by his attitude to earthly gifts 
and honour. What is your attitude to gifts – especially when ungodly 
people  (like  Belshazzar)  want  to  give  you  large  gifts  because  you  did  
something for them in the Name of Jesus? Be different from the other 
preachers  of  these  days  and  say,  “No.  Thank  you.  I’ll  give  you  God’s  
Word and bless you. But I don’t want your gifts.” Many servants of the 
Lord  have  destroyed  themselves  by  receiving  gifts  from  people  from  
whom they should not have received anything. It is right to receive a 
gift from God’s people – if the gift is given voluntarily, and if those people 

426 Through the Bible: Restoration Begins with a Man
Daniel
are financially better off than you are. But it is totally wrong to receive 
money for your personal needs from anyone who is poorer than you – 
even if they are believers.
Daniel then told Belshazzar, “You know everything that has happened. 
Yet you have not humbled yourself. You have defied God by taking cups 
from His temple to drink.” (5:22, 23). Daniel was a fearless prophet and 
he warned the king of danger. And then he read the words, “Mene, mene, 
tekel, upharsin” and interpreted them (5:25).
We have already seen the first instance of speaking in a language not 
learnt  –  by  Balaam’s  donkey.  Here  is  the  first  instance  of  interpreta-
tion  of  an  unknown  language.  The  message  was,  “God  has  numbered  
your kingdom and put an end to it. You have been weighed on the scales 
and found deficient. Your kingdom has been divided and given over to the 
Medes and Persians” (5:26–28).
That  is  God’s  word  to  Babylonian  religious  systems  today  as  well.  
“God has numbered your days and they are coming to an end. God has 
weighed  you  and  found  nothing  of  eternal  weight  in  you.  You  are  full  
of worldliness, and therefore your kingdom is divided.” That very night 
Babylon was conquered by Medo-Persia (5:30).
In Chapter  6  we  come  to  the  time  when  King  Darius  was  ruling  the  
Medo-Persian empire. He too appointed Daniel to be one of his adminis-
trators (6:2). Even though Daniel was the Prime Minister in the previous 
kingdom, Darius still made him the Prime Minister in his kingdom. What 
a testimony Daniel must have had to earn the confidence of successive 
rulers in different kingdoms. Daniel was now more than 80 years old – 
but he was still the same uncompromising man that he had always been 
– and God honoured him.
There  were  evil  people  in  that  kingdom  however  who  were  jealous  of  
Daniel and who wanted to destroy him. They went to the king and got 
him to pass a law that was primarily directed against Daniel. This is so 
similar  to  what  happens  even  today.  Evil  people  seek  to  destroy  God’s  
servants and get governments to pass laws that forbid people from being 
converted to Christ. The threat in Daniel’s time was, “If you pray to any 
other  god,  you  will  be  thrown  to  the  lions.”  Today  the  threat  may  be,  
“If you convert anyone to Christianity, you will be thrown in jail”!
When  Daniel  heard  that  the  king  had  passed  this  law,  what  did  he  
do? He knelt down and prayed. He feared God more than he feared any 
king  or  government.  And  like  the  apostles  would  say  in  a  future  day,  
Daniel’s attitude too was, “We ought to obey God rather than men” (Acts 
5:29). So the very thing that the king’s edict said he was not to do, he did. 
No law was going to stop him from praying to his God. He used to pray 
always  with  his  windows  open  towards  Jerusalem.  He  could  now  have  
considered praying with his windows closed. But he was not ashamed to 
be seen praying to the only true God and so he kept the windows open.

Daniel
We too must never be ashamed to be openly known as disciples of the 
Lord Jesus Christ.
And he prayed not just once a day, but three times a day – as he had 
always done. Those jealous officials were just waiting for this moment – 
and as soon as they saw Daniel praying, they reported him to the king. 
The king liked Daniel and wanted to save him. But the officials reminded 
him that “the law of the Medes and the Persians” could not be revoked. 
So he had to throw Daniel into the den of lions. But, as we know, God 
protected Daniel from the lions.
There are people around us today too who are jealous of the blessing 
of God upon our lives and who are waiting to harm us in some way. But 
the Lord will stand by us. In Daniel’s time, the fire and the lions were 
not permitted to touch God’s servants. But under the new covenant, God 
gives His children the honour to die as martyrs for the faith and so the 
lions are permitted to eat them up and the fire is permitted to burn them. 
Millions of Christians have been martyred for their faith in these twenty 
centuries. But there is one lion that cannot hurt us – Satan. And there is 
one fire that cannot touch us – the fire of hell. Nothing of the spirit of hell 
– hatred or bitterness etc. – can ever come into our hearts. Like Jesus, we 
too will be able to say, “When the prince of this world comes, he will find 
nothing in me” (John 14:30).
Daniel’s life was a testimony to the people of Medo-Persia concerning 
the true God. God allows trials to come to us too, in order to manifest our 
testimony to others. When we endure in persecution and love our perse-
cutors, others will see Christ in us. If you are taken to court for the sake 
of the faith, determine to speak the truth and never to hate anyone. And 
if we have to lay down our lives for the gospel one day, let us lay it down 
with our heads lifted up and a spirit of praise in our hearts to the Lord 
because we know that our God is on the throne.
Prophecies About the Future
The first six chapters of Daniel are historical. The last six chapters are 
prophecies about the future. 
In Chapters  7  and  8,  Daniel  is  given  a  vision  of  future  world  king-
doms. He was about 87 years old now, and he was still having visions 
and dreams just like he had when he was a young man, because he was 
walking faithfully with God. 
In Chapter 7, we see the same five kingdoms that Nebuchadnezzar saw 
in his dream – Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome and the final world 
empire – but from a different perspective. Nebuchadnezzar saw them as 
precious metals, gold, silver, bronze and iron. Daniel saw them as wild 
beasts, which was how God saw them! The people of the world see earthly 
kingdoms as valuable, precious metals. It is an honour to be a King or 
President or Prime Minister of a country. But God sees the kingdoms of 

428 Through the Bible: Restoration Begins with a Man
Daniel
the earth in an entirely different light. He sees all of them as wild beasts, 
because the whole world is under the rule of Satan.
The  detailed  prophecies  given  in  Chapters  7  and  11  were  fulfilled 
exactly as foretold here in the coming centuries. In Chapter 7:4, we read 
a prophecy of Nebuchadnezzar’s wings being clipped. The second beast 
which  looked  like  a  bear  referred  to  Medo-Persia  (7:5).  The  third  beast  
looked  like  a  leopard  with  four  wings  and  four  heads  and  represented  
Greece under Alexander the Great (7:6). When he died, his kingdom was 
divided into four parts. Finally Daniel saw a beast with ten horns and a 
little horn that arose from among those ten. This referred to the Roman 
empire first of all (that ruled the world when Jesus came to earth). The 
horns referred to an empire that would arise in the last days ending in 
the  rule  of  the  Antichrist  (the  little  horn),  just  before  Christ  returns  to  
earth (7:7, 8). At the end of the chapter, we see God sitting on His throne 
with millions of angels worshipping Him and the dominion of the earth 
being given to His saints.
In Chapter 8, we are given a little more detail again about these kingdoms. 
The first vision is about the Grecian empire (8:5–8). The goat (the Grecian 
empire  under  Alexander)  became  very  powerful  and  conquered  nations  
with “great speed” (8:8). Greece became a world ruler unlike Babylon and 
Medo-Persia.  But  at  the  height  of  its  power,  when  Alexander  the  Great  
was just 33 years old, he died suddenly (the horn was suddenly broken 
off). When he died, his four generals divided the kingdom among them-
selves (the four horns of the goat). At the end of their rule, a fierce king, a 
master of intrigue, rose to power. This refers to the king who ruled Syria 
– a descendant of one of Alexander’s generals. His name was Antiochus 
Epiphanes. “Epiphanes” means “God made manifest” and he is a type of 
the Antichrist who will “display himself as God” (2 Thessalonians 2:4).
In Chapter  9,  we  see  Daniel  praying  for  his  people.  It  was  Daniel’s  
prayer that started the movement of God’s people from Babylon back to 
Jerusalem. Daniel was 87 years old now and he was still studying God’s 
word and fasting and praying, just like he did in his younger days (9:3). It 
is wonderful to see a man of God at the age of 87, still as much on fire as 
he was in his teenage years, studying the word as much as he did in his 
youth, fasting and praying as much as he did in his younger days, and 
still being a servant of the people as he was when he was young. What a 
wonderful example Daniel is for all of us.
Daniel  didn’t  criticise  the  other  Jews.  He  didn’t  say,  “Lord,  these  
Jews around me are all backsliders.” Instead he said, “Lord, WE have 
sinned, WE have rebelled, WE have refused to listen to Your messages. 
Lord,  You  are  right  and  OUR  faces  are  covered  with  shame”  (9:7).  We  
see there how Daniel identified himself with his backslidden fellow-
Jews. He did not say, “They”, but “We”. That is how we need to pray 
too: “Lord, WE Christians have dishonoured Your Name in this land. 

Prophecies About the Future                                                                                                                 429
Daniel
We have not been the testimony for Christ that India needed to see. We 
have failed. Lord, send us a revival. Lord, You are right, and our faces 
are covered with shame. Be merciful and forgive us. We have sinned 
against You.” He uses the words, “Thy” and “Thine” ten times.
Then God gave Daniel another vision and told him that 490 years had 
been  determined  for  His  purposes  for  Jerusalem (9:24,  25).  7  sets  of  
7 years (49 years) and 62 sets of 7 years (434 years) – making a total of 
483 years – would pass from the time the command is given to rebuild 
Jerusalem  until  the  Anointed  One  (Christ)  comes  there.  And  that  
was fulfilled exactly. In 445 B.C., the command went forth to rebuild 
Jerusalem. 483 years later in 29 A.D. Jesus came to Jerusalem and was 
crucified. So if you had understood the prophecy of Daniel, you would 
have known the exact year in which Christ would be crucified. Out of the 
490 years, a period of 7 years still remains. That 7-year-period would be 
at the end of time. The Antichrist will rule the earth during that time and 
Christians will face tremendous persecution and tribulation everywhere, 
and will be hated by everyone. Then Christ will return.
In Chapter 10, we read of Daniel praying for three weeks. During this 
time a great struggle went on in the heavenlies. Daniel fasted partially 
during  this  time.  He  abstained  from  eating  rich  meats  and  ate  simple  
food. At the end of the three weeks, an angel came to Daniel and told him 
he was “highly esteemed” by God (10:11). He also told him that he had 
been trying to come to him, but was hindered by the evil spirit that rules 
over  Persia  for  21  days.  From  the  moment  that  Daniel  began  to  pray,  
his request had been heard. But it took 21 days for the answer to come 
(10:12, 13). God doesn’t always answer our prayers immediately. But if 
we persist in prayer, the answer will definitely come.
Remember, however, that this incident of an evil spirit resisting Michael 
took place before Jesus died on the cross. At that time Satan and his 
demons  had  not  yet  been  defeated.  Today  we  don’t  need  21  days  to  
overcome a demon. Jesus never took 21 days to cast out any demon. 
Now that every demon has been defeated by our Lord, we operate from 
a  completely  different  position  than  Daniel  did.  Today,  if  we  resist  
the devil, he will flee from us immediately  (James  4:7).  His  activities  
can  be  restrained  and  he  himself  will  be  under  our  feet  very  soon  
(Romans 16:20).
In 10:21, we read, “There is no one who stands firmly with me against 
these forces...”. Many years earlier, the Lord had told Ezekiel that when 
He  looked  for  intercessors,  He  did  not  find  even  one  (Ezekiel  22:30). 
Daniel was now a lone intercessor and he teaches us how much God can 
accomplish through just one man.
In 11:2, we read a brief history of the Persian empire. Alexander the 
Great of Greece is referred to in 11:3. His kingdom would not go to his 

430 Through the Bible: Restoration Begins with a Man
Daniel
descendants  but  would  be  divided  among  his  four  generals  (11:4).  The  
king of the south mentioned here is Egypt and the king of the north is Syria 
(11:5, 6). 22 wars in the history of these two nations are prophesied in 
this chapter. 11:6 refers to the Egyptian King Ptolemy’s daughter Bernice 
being married King Antiochus II of Syria. 11:10 refers to Antiochus III. 
11:16 refers to Syria’s conquest of Palestine. In 11:18 we read of Syria’s 
defeat at the hands of Rome. 11:19 refers to Antiochus being killed. 11:21 
refers to Antiochus IV also known as Antiochus Epiphanes (the type of 
the  Antichrist).  11:31 refers to this Antiochus sacrificing a pig on the 
altar in the temple in Jerusalem.
Many things written in this chapter have a dual fulfilment. It was first 
fulfilled in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes around 170 B.C. It will be 
fulfilled again in the time of the Antichrist in the last days.
11:32 is a very significant verse that teaches that in the last days there 
will be compromisers as well as wholehearted disciples of the Lord. The 
compromisers  will,  with  “smooth  words,  turn  to  godlessness  those  who  
act wickedly toward the covenant”. But the wholehearted will “know God 
and be strong and do exploits for God.” In those days, “those who have 
insight will give understanding to many. Many teachers will be killed by 
the fire and by the sword and will suffer in other ways too. Some will fall 
victim to persecution and will be refined and cleansed and made pure” 
(11:32–35).
11:36 refers  to  the  Antichrist  again:  “The  king  will  do  as  he  pleases,  
and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak 
monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the 
indignation is finished.” 11:38 refers to the worship of power and wealth 
that will be prevalent everywhere in the last days. 11:39 refers to the 
help the Antichrist will get from demons. He will rule in Jerusalem but 
his end will come very quickly (11:45).
In Chapter  12, we read first of all about the great tribulation in the 
days of the Antichrist (12:1). Then of the two resurrections – one to ever-
lasting life and one to disgrace and shame (12:2). Those who are wise in 
this world are assured that they will shine as bright as the noonday sky 
in the final day. And those who turn many to righteousness in this world 
will shine as the stars forever (12:3). The book of Daniel will be a sealed 
book, not capable of being understood until the last days (12:4, 9).
Two significant prophecies about the last days are found here in 12:4: 
“Many  will  go  back  and  forth,  and  knowledge  will  increase.”  Travel  will  
increase considerably in the last days. From the time of Adam until the 
mid-19
th
 century man’s speed of travel was the speed of a horse. And so he 
could not travel very far. But the 20
th
 century changed all that suddenly.

Daniel
Now world-travellers number in the millions and man has travelled even 
to the moon! It is prophesied here that knowledge also will increase in the 
last days. We see that being fulfilled in our lifetime too. All the scientific 
knowledge that man accumulated over a period of 5900 years (from the 
time of Adam to 1939), increased by twenty times within 40 years (from 
1939 to 1979). And since then it has been increasing at an astounding 
pace  that  defies  calculation. A  graph  of  man’s  increase  in  knowledge  
would show a very flat gradient for 99% of his history and then a sudden 
sharp rise upwards to about hundred times the height in this last period 
of man’s history.
Daniel himself could not understand what he prophesied (12:9) but he 
was told to go his way faithfully until the end of his life and he would 
then be rewarded with the place appointed for him (12:9, 13).
Do you want to shine like a star forever in eternity? Then turn people 
to righteousness today. Spend your life turning others to a godly life. And 
in the end, you will rise again and receive the reward the Lord has kept 
for you.



HOSEA
Spiritual Adultery and  
God’s Unchanging Love
H
osea prophesied to the northern kingdom of Israel. The subject of 
his prophecy was spiritual adultery and God’s unchanging love. His 
prophecy shows that God’s attitude toward His people was that of 
a husband who kept on loving an unfaithful wife.
Israel was called the “Bride of Jehovah” in the Old Testament. The rela-
tionship between God and Israel was to be like a marriage relationship 
– just like our relationship with Christ is today. If a wife loves a man 
other than her husband, or seeks to please other men, she is unfaith-
ful and could rightfully be called “an adulteress”. It is exactly the same 
with our relationship with our Lord. If we are married to Christ and we 
love money, we are spiritual adulteresses, because money is “another 
man”. If we love the honour of this world, that too would be respond-
ing to “another man” (the world) trying to gain our attention. If we love 
sinful  pleasure,  that  too  is  a  part  of  the  world.  That  is  why  James,  
speaking  to  believers,  says,  “You  adulteresses,  don’t  you  know  that  
friendship with the world is enmity with God?” (James 4:4).
Hosea’s Training
Hosea deals with this very important subject. And God taught him this 
lesson in a very painful way. What we see in Hosea, perhaps more than 
in any other Old Testament prophet, is God trying to make His servant 
feel His heart. This is the principle of true prophetic ministry even in the 
New Testament. We have to feel towards God’s people the way God feels 
towards  them.  We  have  to  look  at  God’s  people  the  way  God  looks  at  
them. Otherwise we will be just preachers who are preaching something, 

434 Through the Bible: Spiritual Adultery and God’s Unchanging Love 
Hosea
which  may  be  true,  but  without  the  feeling  that  God  has  towards  His  
people.  So  God  has  to  take  us  through  many  painful  trials  in  order  to  
make us feel the way He feels towards people, before we can effectively 
minister to them.
For example, in Hosea’s time, Israel was like an unfaithful wife. When 
she  worshipped  idols  she  was  being  unfaithful  to  the  Lord.  That  was  
pictured  as  adultery.  Adultery  and  idolatry  were  very  closely  linked  in  
the Old Testament. Even in the New Testament, spiritual adultery is a 
form of idolatry. Idolatry means worshipping something other than the 
true God. It may be your business, your property, your money, your good 
looks.  It  may  even  be  your  ministry.  Anything  that  takes  the  place  of  
Christ as Number One in your life is an idol. And as soon as something 
has taken the place of God in your life, you have become an idolater, a 
spiritual adulteress. All the words that are spoken to adulteresses and 
idolaters will apply to you at that point.
The way God made Hosea feel His heart was by making him marry an 
unfaithful wife. That was a painful way for Hosea to learn the truth. 
Which man would be willing to marry a girl who he knows, from the 
outset, will be unfaithful to him and will commit adultery with other 
men? It was a heavy price that these prophets had to pay in order to 
be prophets. When Hosea’s wife was unfaithful to him, he was told to 
keep on loving her. At one point she even went and sold herself as a 
slave to another man. Hosea then paid money to buy her back. And 
he still kept on loving her. But even after he bought her back, she still 
kept on committing adultery. Hosea must have found it very difficult 
to bear with her. As he went through this struggle, God told him, “Now 
you can understand how I love my people. Now go and preach to them.”
As a result, even when Hosea spoke sternly to God’s people, there was 
a note of compassion in his message of holiness. What did he emphasise? 
Holiness and God’s unchanging love. These two themes were the burden 
of all the prophets: Holiness in God’s people and God’s unchanging love 
for His people even when they are in spiritual adultery and gone astray. 
God’s desire was always to bring His people back. He disciplines them; 
but  then  He  wants  to  bring  them  back  to  Him  after  the  discipline  is  
over. Jeremiah said, “After the discipline is over, God will bring you back.” 
Hosea  said  the  same  thing.  Holiness  is  what  God  demands.  When  He  
doesn’t find that in you, He will discipline you. But His love is so great 
that He will then speak tenderly to you and bring you back into fellow-
ship with Him, saying, “How can I give you up? How can I let you go? How 
can I forsake you? My heart cries out within me. How I long to help you!” 
(Hosea 11:8 - Living).
This is how true prophetic ministry should function in the church too. 
A  true  prophet  in  the  church  today  will  have  the  same  burden  that  the  

Hosea’s Training                                                                                                                                        435
Hosea
Old  Testament  prophets  had  for  holiness  among  God’s  people.  And  He  
will be moved as they were, by God’s unchanging, longsuffering, compas-
sionate love that perpetually desires to bring His backslidden people back 
to Him and to genuine holiness. There should be a prophetic ministry in 
every church, if it is to be kept alive and functioning for God as it should.
That  was  Hosea’s  basic  theme.  And  so  God  allowed  Hosea  to  suffer.  
God told Hosea, “Go and marry a prostitute. Some of her children will be 
born to you from other men.” (1:2). What a price to pay to be a prophet! 
How many would want to be prophets? God may not require you to do 
today what Hosea did. But the principle remains the same that He has 
to  take  us  through  deep  suffering  in  order  to  get  us  to  feel  His  heart.  
Read the suffering that the apostle Paul went through – many dangers, 
many  beatings,  imprisonments,  being  beaten  with  rods,  robbed,  not  
having  enough  clothes  to  keep  himself  warm,  not  enough  food  to  eat  
(2 Corinthians 11:23–28). The purpose of all that was to make Paul live 
close to God’s heart so that he could listen to God’s heartbeat and feel as 
God felt. When we go through trials, we come very close to God’s heart. 
We hear His heartbeat and we feel that, as we speak to His people.
There is a lot of difference between such a preacher and a man who 
has just acquired a lot of knowledge by reading books and by listening 
to sermons. Do you want to serve God? Do you want to preach the way 
God wants you to preach? Then ask God to help you to feel His heart-
beat. That will not come by just studying the Bible in a classroom. It 
will come by going through trials. It will not come merely by attending 
meetings  or  reading  good  Christian  books  –  even  though  all  that  is  
good. We all have a great lust for knowledge and we may think, “If only 
I can get more Bible-knowledge I can serve the Lord.” You may look at 
some servant of God today and say, “I want to serve the Lord like he 
does.” Yes, you can do that. But only if you allow God to crush you by 
taking you through deep sufferings that others may never know about. 
Every  true  servant  of  God  has  gone  through  hard  trials  that  others  
know  nothing  about,  and  most  of  the  time  he  won’t  even  tell  others  
what he has gone through.
Hosea teaches us that the only way to effectively minister is by going 
through deep suffering in one’s personal life. God does this by different 
methods for different people. He does not have a standard syllabus for all 
of God’s children. He taught Hosea through a difficult wife. But He taught 
Jeremiah without a wife, by putting him in a deep pit. And He taught Paul 
without a wife but through many imprisonments. So the procedure is not 
the same for everyone. But the principle remains the same: You have to 
suffer if you want to have a ministry from God. Paul said, “I have gone 
through many trials – and the strength I received from God in that suffering 
is what I can now pass on to other people” (2 Corinthians 1:4). Without 
such experiences, we will only pass on dead knowledge to people.

436 Through the Bible: Spiritual Adultery and God’s Unchanging Love 
Hosea
Hosea  married  Gomer,  but  some  of  her  children  were  born  through  
others. Her first son was Hosea’s. The next two were perhaps not his. The 
names  of  those  children  indicated  how  God  was  punishing  His  people.  
God says, “This is the way of Israel; When she runs after her lovers she 
won’t be able to catch up with them. She will search for them but won’t 
find them. And then she will say, ‘I might as well return to my husband 
because I was better off with him than I am now’ ”  (2:7). Hosea’s wife went 
away  from  him  in  the  same  way  that  Israel  went  away  from  God.  But  
when Israel was in trouble, she sought God again. Most people seek God 
only when they are in trouble. When they find that money doesn’t solve 
their problems and that the people of the world let them down, then they 
turn back to God and seek His help. And God helps them. So God told 
Hosea,  “Take  your  wife  back  even  when  she  returns  to  you  only  as  a  
last resort.”
The Lord said, “She does not know that it was I who gave her the grain, 
the new wine and the oil, and lavished on her silver and gold, which they 
used for Baal” (2:8). This verse can apply to us too. Do you realise that 
everything you have has come from God? Do you realise that your health 
is God’s gift? The money you have is God’s gift. The intelligence you have 
is God’s gift. But Israel used their gold and silver to make idols to Baal. 
Do you use what God has given you for this world and its pleasures?
Remember  the  parable  of  the  prodigal  son.  He  took  money  from  his  
father, and he didn’t use it for his father’s business. He spent it all on 
himself. This is the mark of God’s backslidden people. They get so many 
gifts from God, and what do they do with it? They think, “This body is 
mine. I can use it as I like. This intelligence is mine. I must use it as much 
as possible for my own profit. This money is mine. I earned it all myself. 
I  can use it as I like.” That is what it means to take the gold and silver 
that God gives us and to make an idol for Baal through them. God says, 
“They do not realise that everything they have is what I gave them.”
How is it with you? If you recognise that everything is God’s, then you 
will give it all back to Him and say, “Lord, You gave me all these gifts and 
I want to use them all for Your kingdom.”
But in spite of Israel being so unfaithful, the Lord says, “I will win her 
back. I will lead her into the desert. I will make things dry and barren in 
her life. And when everything is dry and barren she will turn to Me. Then 
I will speak tenderly to her there” (2:14).
No husband will speak so tenderly to someone who has been so totally 
unfaithful  to  him.  But  the  Lord  says,  “I  will  speak  tenderly  and  I  will  
continue  to  give  her  gifts.  I  will  return  her  vineyards  to  her.  I  will  trans-
form the valley of Achor into a gateway of hope” (2:14, 15). Achor was the 
place  where  Achan  had  been  put  to  death  for  his  sin  of  stealing  what  
was the Lord’s in Jericho (Joshua 7). It was a place of judgement for sin. 
And  now  the  Lord  says,  “I  am  going  to  make  the  place  of  judgement  a  
door of hope for you. Even though you have failed, and judgement and 

Hosea’s Training                                                                                                                                        437
Hosea
chastening have come upon you because of that, yet now because you 
have confessed your sin, I will open a door of hope for you in this very 
place  so  that  something  beautiful  will  come  forth  from  your  life  in  the  
coming days.”
That is a wonderful message for those who have backslidden and gone 
away from God, and for those who have wasted many years of their life. 
Many are discouraged because they have wasted so many years of their 
life  and  done  so  many  wrong  things.  They  wish  they  had  known  these  
truths  when  they  were  younger.  You  have  been  chastened.  You  have  
suffered. Now the Lord says to you, “Don’t get discouraged. I will make 
the valley of Achor a gateway of hope for you.”
Then the Lord goes on to say “In that coming day, you will call Me, ‘My 
Husband’  and  not  ‘My  Master’  ”  (Hosea  2:16).  In  the  old  covenant  they  
could not know the type of relationship that we can have with the Lord 
today  as  husband  and  wife.  This  relationship  is  what  the  Holy  Spirit  
brings  into  our  lives.  Just  as  Abraham’s  servant  brought  Rebecca  to  
Isaac,  the  Holy  Spirit  brings  us  to  Jesus  so  that  we  can  be  married  to  
Him. In the Old Testament they knew Him as Master. Now He says, “You 
won’t call Me, ‘Master’ any more. You will call Me, ‘Husband.’ ”
What  type  of  relationship  do  you  have  with  the  Lord?  Do  you  know  
that  today  He  does  not  want  to  be  your  Master  primarily,  but  your  
Husband?  For  many  people  their  service  for  the  Lord  is  boring  and  
heavy because it is like a servant serving his master. It is like working 
for a difficult boss just for the sake of the salary. But a wife does not 
serve  her  husband  for  a  salary.  A  boss  will  not  share  his  personal  
wealth with his employee, but a husband does. A husband even takes 
care of his wife. But the wife doesn’t serve her husband for all that. She 
serves him out of love. The Lord says, “Even if you are unfaithful, I will 
be faithful to you and make you Mine” (2:20). See the tremendous love 
of  God  here  pursuing  relentlessly  after  someone  who  has  gone  away  
from Him. That is how the Lord cares for each of us.
Hosea’s  wife  sold  herself  as  a  slave.  But  Hosea  “bought  her  back  for  
fifteen pieces of silver and five bushels of barley and a measure of wine” 
(3:2)  and  told  her,  “You  must  live  in  my  house  for  many  days  and  stop  
your prostitution.”
This is a picture of God’s love. 
Since  Israel  was  about  to  go  into  captivity  soon,  Hosea  told  his  wife  
that  during  that  time  she  would  not  have  sex  with  any  man  and  not  
even with him (3:3). This was to illustrate that even though God had not 
forsaken  Israel,  yet  He  would  keep  Israel  away  from  Him  for  a  period  
of  time.  He  was  going  to  chasten  them  by  letting  them  be  without  any  
temple priests for a period. But God would ultimately bring His people 
back to Him. This is always His desire.

438 Through the Bible: Spiritual Adultery and God’s Unchanging Love 
Hosea
From  his  experience  of  suffering,  Hosea  began  to  preach  (Chapter  4  
onwards). He used some very strong words in his message; but the back-
ground for all those strong words came from the sufferings he had been 
through. Our sufferings don’t make us soft. No. We have compassion for 
God’s people, but we will be firm with them.
Israel’s Spiritual Adultery
First  of  all  Hosea  said,  “This  is  the  case  that  the  Lord  has  against  His  
people” (4:1). And then like all the prophets, he started with the leaders. 
Many years ago I was invited as a special speaker to a large denomina-
tional convention in India. There were about 12,000 people there. When I 
got up to speak I said, “The burden the Lord has given me is not to speak 
to  all  of  you  thousands  of  people  sitting  in  front  of  me,  but  to  all  the  
pastors who are sitting behind me on the platform and in the audience.” 
And I spoke on being righteous in money matters. I had been invited to 
speak for three days, but after two days, they told me, “We don’t want you 
to speak any more.” So I sat down quietly on the third day. God always 
starts  with  the  leaders.  If  they  don’t  listen  to  what  God  has  to  say  to  
them, then it will go badly with them thereafter.
The prophets always spoke to the leaders first. It is because the leaders 
go astray that the people go astray. If the children go astray, it is because 
the parents have not brought up those children properly. If your children 
misbehave in school, don’t blame them. You didn’t teach them to behave 
properly at home. Once a mother brought a young boy to me and said, 
“Brother  Zac,  please  pray  for  my  son.  He  doesn’t  study  properly  etc.”  
I wanted to pray for the mother because I felt the problem was with her. 
So I did not pray for the son. I don’t do what people tell me to do. But 
I  told  the  mother  privately,  “You  are  not  going  to  help  your  son  if  you  
humiliate him publicly by saying such things.”
God’s people suffer even today because their leaders are ungodly and 
don’t know God. So Hosea spoke to the priests first (4:4). If you’re a 
leader, don’t point your finger at the congregation and say, “What to 
do? The people in my church are so bad.” The Lord says to you, “My 
complaint is with you leaders. You will stumble in broad daylight, and 
so will all the false prophets (4:5).
“My people are being destroyed because they don’t know Me” (4:6). Why 
are God’s people destroyed? It is not because they don’t know the Bible. 
They don’t know God. The Lord says, “The fault is yours, you priests, 
because you don’t know Me. So I refuse to recognise all of you as priests 
any more. I am removing the anointing from your life. You have forgotten 
the laws of your God and so I will forget to bless your children” (4:6).

Israel’s Spiritual Adultery                                                                                                                         439
Hosea
“The  more  preachers  there  are,  the  more  they  sin  against  Me”  (4:7). 
What a condition! “They have exchanged the glory of God for the disgrace 
of idols.” Do you see how relevant this word is for today! Many preachers 
have lost the anointing of God today because they worshipped the idol of 
money. Once upon a time they were poorer but had the anointing of God. 
Today they are richer but have lost that anointing. They have exchanged 
the glory of God for idols.
The priests were interested only in feeding themselves at the expense 
of people. God’s law had permitted the priests to eat a part of the sin and 
guilt offerings that the people brought (Leviticus 6:25, 26; 7:5–7). So the 
priests were happy when the people sinned, because the more the people 
sinned, the more meat the priests got in their curry!! “The priests get fed 
when the people sin and bring their sin offerings to them. So the priests are 
glad when the people sin!” (4:8 - NLT).
*
Hosea went on to say that the people also were like the priests and so 
both would be punished (4:9). It is because the parents love money (and 
parents  are  the  priests  in  a  family)  that  their  sons  and  daughters  also  
turn to spiritual adultery – even today (4:13). So God says, “Why should I 
punish them? For you men are doing the same thing. O foolish people! You 
will be destroyed, for you refuse to understand.” (4:14). “Their worship is 
mere pretense” (4:15).
“Hear this, you priests and all of Israel’s leaders! Listen, all you men of 
the royal family! These words of judgment are for you: You are doomed! 
For you have led the people into a snare by worshiping idols... But never 
forget – I will settle with all of you for what you have done. One thing is 
certain, when your day of punishment comes, you will become a heap of 
rubble. The leaders of Judah have become as bad as thieves. So I will 
pour my anger down on them like a waterfall.” (5:1, 2, 9, 10). Again it is 
to the leaders that God speaks of judgement first, because they were 
primarily  responsible  for  Israel’s  failures.  Even  today,  Christians  fail  
because their leaders have failed first.
Then the Lord says that He will wait until Israel faces some trouble. 
Then they will turn to Him (5:15). When Israel heard Hosea’s message, 
they said they wanted to turn back to the Lord – just like many do today 
when they hear a powerful word of judgement. They said, “Come, let us 
return to the Lord! He has torn us in pieces; now he will heal us. He has 
injured us; now he will bandage our wounds. In just a short time, he will 
restore  us  so  we  can  live  in  his  presence.  Oh,  that  we  might  know  the  
*   This verse is not very clear in many translations. That is why it is good to read 
these  Old  Testament  prophetic  books  in  The  Living  Bible  and  The  New  Living  
Translation. These versions are not translations but paraphrases and so cannot 
be used to establish doctrine, but they throw light on many verses whose real 
meaning we may not see otherwise.

Hosea
Lord! Let us press on to know him! Then he will respond to us as surely 
as  the  arrival  of  dawn  or  the  coming  of  rains  in  early  spring.”  (6:1–3).  
Many  preachers  would  have  been  excited  to  hear  such  words  and  
imagined that this was a genuine repentance that would lead to revival. 
They would have probably quickly sent a report to their sponsors saying, 
“We have had a revival here. Many thousands raised their hands saying 
they want to turn back to the Lord and signed decision cards”, etc. But 
the Lord’s response was different. He was not fooled. He knew that this 
was only a shallow, emotional turning that would vanish like the morning 
dew in no time at all (6:4). You see the dew on the grass in the morning; 
but an hour later it is gone.
In 6:5, God describes true prophetic ministry: “I sent my prophets to cut 
you to pieces. I have slaughtered you with my words, threatening you with 
death.” It’s not an easy ministry to cut people to pieces. But remember 
that Hosea himself had been cut to pieces by God’s dealings with Him in 
his married life. And it was from such a school of suffering that Hosea 
spoke. 
If Hosea had not had all that suffering in his private life, he would have 
spoken these words in a harsh way. Don’t try to imitate Hosea’s words if 
God hasn’t taken you through the deep valley of suffering. It is very excit-
ing to act like a prophet in the pulpit. You can get honour for that. But if 
you try to imitate a prophet without God leading you into the sufferings 
that the true prophets underwent, you will be a false prophet. First of all, 
ask God to take you through deep experiences whereby you get to know 
Him – experiences of trials, sufferings and pain. Then God will make you 
His mouthpiece to many people. Walk with God in secret. Humble your-
self under whatever God sends in your life.
And then God said, “I don’t want your sacrifices. I want you to be merci-
ful.” This is the verse Jesus quoted in Matthew 12:7. And because they 
were not merciful to others, God threatened them with judgement (6:11).
God  wanted  to  heal  Israel,  but  its  sins  were  far  too  great.  Samaria,  
the capital of Israel, was filled with liars, thieves and bandits (7:1). The 
leaders of Israel told lies and stole. Many Christian preachers are guilty 
of this today. They tell lies in the reports that they send to Western coun-
tries to raise money. And then when they get money they steal it and use 
it for themselves. If money is sent to India for God’s work, and a Christian 
leader  uses  it  to  live  in  grand  style  himself  or  to  buy  property  for  his  
family, what is he? A thief. 
Then  God  said,  “My  people  mingle  with  godless  foreigners”  (verse  8). 
They  pick  up  the  godless  ways  of  these  godless  people.  Many  believ-
ers today mingle with worldly people, adopt worldly standards, worldly 
methods  and  worldly  business  principles  in  Christian  work.  In  their  
preaching  they  adopt  the  methods  used  by  psychologists.  Much  of  the  
preaching from Christian pulpits today is pure psychology. It’s not God’s 
word. It is just a pep-talk to make people feel good. The Lord went on to 

The Judgement of God                                                                                                                            441
Hosea
say, “They have all become like a half-baked cake, cooked on one side, not 
cooked on the other side” (verse 8).
It is too late to repent of all these after the enemy has come (8:1–4). 
Israel had become “a vessel in which no-one delights, because they had 
despised God’s Word and His laws” (8:8, 12).
The Judgement of God
“O Israel, don’t rejoice like other people do” (9:1). The Bible is full of exhor-
tations to rejoice in the Lord. But here is a verse which tells Israel not to 
rejoice like other people do – because they had been unfaithful to God. 
They are called a harlot, because they are offering sacrifices to idols. 
When a person who worships money, man’s honour, sinful pleasure and a 
comfortable life, comes to a Sunday morning church-meeting and shouts 
the  praises  of  God,  do  you  know  what  God  says  from  heaven?  “Don’t  
rejoice. You are a harlot who worships idols”. God says some things that 
startle us. That’s why prophets who speak forth what God is saying are 
the most misunderstood men in both Old and New Testaments.
God then criticises Israel for bringing forth fruit for herself (10:1). She has 
a divided heart that seeks to love God and her own interests and speaks 
“mere  words  and  worthless  promises”  to  God  (10:4).  Much  that  we  read  
about  the  behaviour  of  Israel  in  Old  Testament  times  is  being  repeated  
among Christians today. God’s word to them is also His word to us today, 
“Sow  with  a  view  to  righteousness.  Reap  in  accordance  with  kindness;  
Break  up  your  fallow  ground,  for  it  is  time  to  seek  the  LORD  until  He  
comes to rain righteousness” (Hosea 10:12). God is inviting us to plough 
up the hard ground of our hearts and to plant good seeds of righteousness. 
As we seek the Lord, He will rain showers of righteousness on us.
The Love of God for Israel
The last four chapters of Hosea are about God’s love for Israel and the 
restoration of the nation and the ultimate triumph of love over judgement.
“When Israel was a child I loved him and out of Egypt I called My son” 
(11:1).  This  verse  although  referring  to  Israel’s  redemption  from  Egypt  
is quoted in Matthew 2:15 as applying to Jesus returning to Israel from 
Egypt. This shows how Scripture (since it is the inspired word of God) is 
capable of more than one meaning! 
God knows all about the deceit and unfaithfulness among His people 
(11:12).  Yet  His  tender  heart  yearns  for  them  saying,  “Oh,  how  can  I  
give you up, My son? How can I let you go? My heart cries out within me; 
how I long to help you! No, I will not punish you as much as my fierce 
anger tells me to. This is the last time I will destroy you. For I am God 
and not man; I am the Holy One living among you, and I did not come to 
destroy” (11:8, 9). This compassionate God is our Father.

442 Through the Bible: Spiritual Adultery and God’s Unchanging Love 
Hosea
“These people are crafty merchants selling from dishonest scales. They 
love to cheat. They cheat others and then they boast, ‘I am rich. I have got 
it all by myself. No one knows that I got it by cheating’ ”  (12:7, 8). There is a 
lot of unrighteously-earned money among Christian businessmen today, 
which they have cleverly hidden from the eyes of others. Financial success 
has given them acceptance in the eyes of immature believers and many 
of them are elders in good assemblies. Outwardly they appear righteous 
and get honour in their churches. They say, “No one knows that I got it 
by cheating because my outward testimony is spotless.” They are clever 
merchants who have deceived the people. But they can’t deceive God or 
His prophets. One day God will expose every one of them. True prophets 
also can see through such people. That is why these rich business people 
will not get close to a true prophet. Let me encourage you to be a voice for 
God against such corruption, in your generation.
“It used to be when Israel spoke, the nations shook with fear, for he was 
a mighty prince; but he worshiped Baal and sealed his doom. And now the 
people disobey more and more.” (13:1, 2). This is the history of many who 
started out as prophetic voices for God. As time went on, they compro-
mised with money and the things of this world and sealed their doom. 
Now people are no longer stirred when they speak.
“O  Death,  where  are  your  thorns?  O  Sheol,  where  is  your  sting?” 
(13:14). This is a beautiful verse about the resurrection and is quoted in 
1 Corinthians 15:55.
Hosea finally invites Israel to return to the Lord and even tells them 
what to say: “Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, for you have stum-
bled  because  of  your  iniquity.  Take  words  with  you  and  return  to  the  
LORD.  Say  to  Him,  ‘Take  away  all  iniquity  and  receive  us  graciously,  
that we may present the fruit of our lips’ ” (14:1, 2). The fruit of our lips 
is  “the sacrifice of praise”  as  we  read  in  Hebrews  13:15.  It  is  to  the  
place of perpetual praise that God wants to bring all of us finally – the 
place where we become His worshippers, and where our relationship 
with Him is more important to us than everything else.
The Lord finally promises us, “I will cure you of idolatry ... and My love 
will know no bounds, for my anger will be forever gone!” (14:4). The love 
of money is the idolatry that is so deeply entrenched within all of us that 
only the Lord can deliver us from. The love of money is like a big onion. 
You peel off one layer and there is another underneath and many more 
layers  below  that.  Only  God  can  show  us  those  layers  one  by  one  and  
free us from them little by little. I once told a carnal brother, “I think your 
problem  is  your  love  of  money.”  But  he  replied  saying,  “O  no,  Brother  
Zac. I am free from that.” I told him, “Well, you must be better than me, 
because I find that I am still battling it.” He did not see his need and so 
fell away through the love of money later. The one who thinks he stands

Hosea
is the one who falls away first. Do you think you are totally free (as Jesus 
was) from the love of money? May God have mercy on you if you think so. 
Ask God to give you light on yourself.
God  then  says, “I  will  refresh  you  like  the  dew  from  heaven.  You  will  
return  and  rest  beneath  My  shadow.  You  will  be  a  watered  garden  and  
blossom” (14:5–7). This is a promise of the outpouring of His Spirit that 
will make our lives like a watered garden.
“Whoever is wise, let him understand these things: The paths of the Lord 
are true and right, and the righteous will walk along them. But sinners 
trying them will fail” (14:9).
There are only two categories of people: Righteous men who walk along 
the paths of the Lord – and sinners who do not. Those who are wise will 
recognise this.



JOEL
The Day of the Lord
J
oel was a prophet to Judah, the southern kingdom. His prophecy is 
a short one and his subject is the day of the Lord. The Lord sent him 
to Judah at a time when a swarm of locusts had caused a serious 
devastation of the crops.
Sometimes,  in  natural  calamities  we  have  to  see  the  hand  of  God  –  
and we need a prophet at such times to tell us why God allowed this to 
happen.
In 2 Samuel 21:1, we read that there was a famine in the time of David 
for  three  continuous  years.  This  was  abnormal.  And  so  David  sought  
the Lord to know the reason for it. The Lord showed him that there was 
a long-standing sin that had not been set right. When that sin was set 
right, the famine ceased immediately.
Sometimes sickness is caused by sin, as in the case of the man who 
was lame for 38 years (John 5:14). 1 Corinthians 11:30 tells us that some 
believers  in  Corinth  were  sick  and  some  had  even  died  because  they  
were living in sin and taking part in the Lord’s table. James 5:16 says, 
“Confess your sins and pray for one another that you may be healed.”
So whenever there is a calamity or a sickness, it is good for us to ask 
ourselves what the Lord is trying to say to us through it. Even if we 
have  an  accident,  it  is  good  to  hear  what  the  Lord  is  saying  to  us.  
Instead of explaining away all these things as natural phenomena or 
accidental,  why  not  stop  and  ask,  “Lord,  is  there  something  You  are  
trying to tell me through this?” Such a prayer may protect you from 
more serious dangers that lie ahead.
I  remember  the  few  times  when  I  fell,  while  riding  my  two-wheeler  
scooter.  By  the  grace  of  God  I  have  never  been  seriously  hurt  or  hurt  
anyone else in the 45 years that I rode it. But I have had little scrapes. 

446 Through the Bible: The Day of the Lord
Joel
And I have stopped and asked the Lord each time what He was trying to 
tell me. Very often the answer is, “You are driving too fast. Drive slowly.” 
I  have  been  thankful  for  such  warnings,  for  they  have  saved  me  from  
more  serious  accidents  that  could  have  happened  to  me,  if  I  had  not  
slowed down. 
The Present Judgement
So  when  a  plague  of  locusts  came  to  Judah,  the  Lord  sent  Joel  to  tell  
them what it signified. Notice once again that Joel speaks to the leaders 
primarily: “Hear this, O elders, and listen, all inhabitants of the land. Has 
anything like this happened in your days or in your fathers’ days?” (1:2).  
In all their life, they had never experienced any such thing. This was God 
trying to say something to them.
When you listen – and discover that God was chastening you for your 
sins – you can repent of those sins and set those matters right. Then you 
can tell your children about it in later years (1:3), so that they can learn 
and be saved from making the mistakes you made. And in that way God’s 
ways can be made known from one generation to the next – so that all 
can learn to fear God.
But if people are drunk with self-confidence, they will say, “We haven’t 
done anything wrong.” And so Joel asks the drunkards to wake up and 
weep (1:5). See why there is no fruit in your ministry. Ask yourself why 
the grapes have all been ruined and the new wine gone (1:7). Is it God’s 
will that we should be unfruitful? No. Jesus taught very clearly that we 
“should bring forth fruit that remains” (John 15:16). It is God’s will that 
we  should  be  fruitful  –  fruitful  in  our  character,  producing  the  fruit  
of the Spirit, and fruitful in our ministry too, whatever our particular 
calling is. 
But  here  Joel  says,  “The  locusts  have  destroyed  your  fruit  and  you  
don’t seem to be bothered by it at all” (1:4 - ff).
Joy itself had withered away from the lives of God’s people (1:12). When 
you  lose  your  joy,  you  can  be  sure  that  you  are  a  backslider.  A  true  
disciple  of  Jesus  is  always  full  of  joy.  He  may  have  many  trials  and  
sorrows; but he has joy in them all. Murmuring and complaining are 
signs of backsliding.
When did the children of Israel murmur? When they were in the wilder-
ness. And God destroyed them for murmuring. 1 Corinthians 10:10, 11 
tells us that we are now being warned not to murmur like them. If you 
complain  because  the  food  was  not  cooked  right,  you  are  still  in  the  
wilderness.  Please  remember  that.  When  joy  has  dried  up,  you  are  a  

Repentance Precedes the Outpouring of the Spirit                                                                            447
Joel
backslider. What should you do then? Go to God and fast and pray and 
weep – especially the leaders and the preachers (1:12–14). Call the people 
together. Tell them to fast and pray because there is no fruit in the church 
– no growth in character and no fruit in the ministry.
Repentance Precedes the Outpouring of the Spirit
Blow the trumpet in Zion (the church) and sound the alarm, because this 
is a serious matter that must be settled before the day of the Lord arrives 
(2:1). The day of the Lord will be a day of darkness and gloom for all who 
have not confessed their sins and settled matters with God now. The day 
of  chastening  was  only  a  warning  to  be  ready  for  a  greater  judgement  
that was coming. We need not fear to turn to God, for He is gracious and 
merciful  (2:13). He is filled with kindness and He is not at all eager to 
punish us. He wants to send us a blessing. So let us seek Him (2:14, 15). 
We are encouraged here to call all of God’s people to fast and pray as 
a church – the elders, the children, the bridegroom and the bride, every-
one. And let them all pray saying, “Lord, spare Your people. Don’t let us 
become an object of mockery among the heathen” (2:16, 17).
Do  you  know  that  Christians  are  an  object  of  mockery  among  the  
heathen in most countries of the world? There was a meeting recently in 
a city in India where a Christian preacher claimed to be able to heal the 
sick. They had advertised the meetings saying, “The blind are seeing, the 
lame are walking and the deaf are hearing...”, etc. Some anti-Christian 
people brought a doctor and some sick people (with problems much less 
than blindness) to the meeting, and asked the preacher to heal them. Of 
course  he  couldn’t  heal  any  of  them.  Then  they  rebuked  the  Christian  
preacher  and  his  team  and  told  them  not  to  deceive  people  with  false  
claims, when they did not have the power to heal anyone. I agree 100% 
with what those people said. We must not deceive people by making false 
claims. That is why the Name of Jesus is being mocked today.
Let us not claim to have gifts which we don’t have. If you have the gift 
of healing, go ahead and exercise it – and people will be genuinely healed 
as Jesus healed people. But don’t go around claiming that you have a gift 
when you don’t have one. Jesus didn’t go around advertising His healing 
gift.  He  did  not  have  to  advertise,  because  He  actually  healed  the  sick  
and soon everybody knew about it, without any advertisement. 
“Then the LORD will be zealous for His land and will have pity on His 
people” (2:18). When we sincerely repent and confess our sins, the Lord 
will  be  indignant  for  the  honour  of  His  name  and  will  answer  us.  And  
how will He answer us? He will pour out His Spirit upon us. “I will pour 
out My Spirit on all the people, and your sons and daughters will proph-
esy and your old men will dream dreams” (2:28). This was the verse that 
Peter quoted as being fulfilled on the day of Pentecost. 120 of them fasted 
and prayed in the upper room for ten days, repenting, seeking God and 

448 Through the Bible: The Day of the Lord
Joel
saying,  ‘Lord,  don’t  let  Your  people  be  the  object  of  mockery  here  in  
Jerusalem’. And the Spirit was poured out on them, and they went forth, 
and the Lord’s Name was glorified where it had once been dishonoured. 
So let me encourage you to blow a trumpet and call a fast and get people 
to seek God – people who are concerned that the Name of Jesus is being 
dishonoured in the land today. What a word of prophecy Joel has for us 
today! Seek God now. Very soon the day of the Lord will come.
When the day of the Lord finally comes, there will be many wonders in 
the sky and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke. Before 
that day, anyone who calls on the name of the Lord Jesus will be saved 
(2:30–32).
The Coming Day of the Lord
Chapter  3  describes  the  day  of  judgement  and  the  millennial  reign  of  
Christ. Before that day arrives, there is something that we need to think 
about.  Multitudes  are  waiting  in  the  valley  of  decision  (3:14).  Millions  
of  people  are  waiting  in  the  valley  of  decision,  not  knowing  which  way  
to turn. This is the time we are living in. The day of the Lord will soon 
come to this valley of decision, when his voice will roar from Zion. But 
for His people, the Lord will be a refuge and a strong fortress at that time 
(3:16). Today we have to warn these millions to be ready to face the day 
of judgement. The Lord will then establish His kingdom of peace on earth 
(3:17, 18).
“Egypt  will  become  a  wasteland  and  Edom  will  become  a  desolate  
wilderness” (3:19). We have three enemies – the world, the flesh and the 
devil. All three are pictured here – Egypt (the world), its ruler Pharaoh 
(the devil) and Edom (the flesh). Edom refers to the descendents of Esau. 
The conflict between Esau and Jacob is a picture of the conflict between 
the flesh and the Spirit. God will deal a death-blow to these three enemies 
in that day – because they attacked God’s people for so many years.  
“But Jerusalem will be inhabited ... the Lord dwells in Zion” (3:20, 21).
The  Lord  will  make  His  home  with  His  people  in  the  church  perma-
nently. That is the ultimate goal of all prophecy: God dwelling in the 
midst of His people.
Today, you and I must call God’s people to repentance, to turning from 
their idols and to seeking God in fasting and prayer. The burden of all the 
prophets was holiness: Give up your idols and put God first in your life. 
True holiness is to have no idols at all in our life. Holiness is to have God 
filling our whole heart. Our calling is to proclaim that today so that the 
church can be a place where God dwells with delight.

AMOS
Privilege Brings Dangers and 
Responsibility
A
mos is the first of the prophetic books containing a prophecy to 
Israel, the northern kingdom. He had been preceded in Israel by 
a  couple  of  miracle-working  prophets  –  Elijah  and  Elisha.  But  
Elijah and Elisha did not leave any written prophecy behind them. Amos 
was the first person to put down his prophecies in writing. 
Amos  started  prophesying  about  40  years  after  Elisha.  If  Gehazi  
(Elisha’s servant) had not chased after Naaman’s money and thus ruined 
himself, it is possible that he may have got a double portion of Elisha’s 
anointing  and  become  the  next  prophet  in  Israel.  In  that  case,  Gehazi  
may  have  written  this  prophecy  instead  of  Amos.  But  Gehazi  missed  
that privilege. The Lord warns us to be watchful so that no one takes our 
crown (Revelation 3:11). There is a crown that God has kept for you if you 
will be faithful in the ministry God planned for you. But you can lose that 
crown  if  you  are  unfaithful.  And  then  the  ministry  you  were  supposed  
to fulfil will be done by somebody else and he will get your crown. So 
perhaps Amos got Gehazi’s crown!
Amos had no desire to be a prophet. He was a simple shepherd – just 
like many of the first apostles were simple fishermen. Elisha had been a 
farmer. Amos was a man who looked after cattle, sheep and figs. When 
questioned about his credentials he said, “I am not a professional prophet. 
I  certainly  never  got  any  training  to  be  a  prophet.  I  am  just  a  shepherd.  
I  take care of fig trees. But the Lord called me away from my flock and told 
me, ‘Go and prophesy to My people in Israel’ ”  (Amos 7:14–15).
Why did God pick Amos to be the first person to write down a prophetic 
message? God must have watched him (like He watches all of us) to see 
if Amos feared God and was faithful in his work. Amos was not a scholar 
or a priest, but he was very faithful in his work. He was God-fearing, was 

450 Through the Bible: Privilege Brings Dangers and Responsibility
Amos
kind to poor people and lived in a good way. And one day, God called him 
and told him, “You are going to be My servant.”
God  watches  us  every  day  to  see  if  we  are  faithful  in  our  daily  life,  
whether we choose the way of humility always, whether we take time to 
wait on Him and listen to Him, to study the Scriptures, etc. Maybe Amos 
had been faithful for 25 years, I don’t know. I know that Jesus was faith-
ful for 30 years in Nazareth before He was called to preach. When you 
continue being faithful in little things for many long years, you can begin 
to wonder whether God has forgotten all about you. He has not. All of a 
sudden, one day, God will say to you, “You are My servant from today.” 
God calls those who are faithful in their secular work. He did that in the 
Old Testament. Jesus also called as apostles men who had been faithful 
in their secular work.
Two expressions that never occur in the book of Amos are ‘the God of 
Israel’ and ‘the Holy One of Israel.’ This was because Amos saw God as 
the God of all nations, and not just the God of Israel. He quotes the Lord’s 
words, “Do you Israelites think that you are more important to Me than the 
Ethiopians?  I  brought  you  out  of  Egypt.  That’s  right.  But  haven’t  I  done  
as much for other nations? I brought the Philistines from Crete. I led the 
Arameans, that is the Syrians, out of Kir. And I brought you out of Egypt. 
What is the difference between you and them?” (9:7).
Amos  was  a  prophet  with  a  “new  covenant”  vision  that  embraced  all  
people of all nations. He believed that God would gather the Gentiles also 
along with the Jews and make them all into one body. Amos rose above 
the petty narrow-mindedness of the Israelites. He had a large heart for 
people all over the world. He was not exclusive like the other Israelites 
who  felt,  “We  are  the  only  people  whom  God  has  accepted.”  There  are  
many Christian groups today too that imagine that God has chosen only 
them to be His people on earth!! In fact, that attitude is one of the identi-
fying marks of a cult. There were people like that in Israel in those days 
too. But not Amos - he had a large heart.
A true servant of God will have a large heart that accepts God’s people 
in every group and denomination. Babylon is not a system that is found 
in any one denomination. It is the world system that can be found right 
inside your heart. People can sit in the best church in the world and be 
a  part  of  Babylon  –  because  Babylon  can  be  in  their  spirit.  They  may  
imagine that because they have come out of a denominational system, 
they are free from Babylon. But that is not true.
For  example,  if  you  love  money,  whichever  church  in  the  world  you  
may belong to, you are a part of Babylon. If you live according to the lusts 
of the flesh, whichever church in the world you are in, you are an adulter-
ess. You can glory in your pure doctrines saying, “We don’t worship Mary 
or practice infant baptism...” Good. But if you worship money and prac-
tise your lusts, you may actually be worse than those others. Theirs is a 

  451
Amos
head-problem (doctrinal), whereas yours is a more serious heart-problem 
(related to life).
There is a lot of exclusivism in Christendom today that imagines that 
God cares only for one’s own little group!! The body of Christ is larger than 
any one denomination. God’s people are not found in any one denomi-
nation today. God has His people in every denomination. There are born 
again  people  in  many  churches  with  different  doctrines.  I  don’t  agree  
with the doctrines of many churches; but I cannot deny the fact that God 
has some of His children there. In the same way, there are unconverted 
people who sit as registered members in evangelical churches and who 
are  breaking  bread  in  “separated”  assemblies  –  especially  those  of  the  
second and third generations in those churches. 
We must see something of Amos’ vision in these days. God punishes 
people  of  all  nations  and  of  all  denominations.  And  He  gathers  people  
also from all nations and all denominations.
Almost  all  of  Amos’  illustrations  come  from  his  shepherd  life.  Even  
though God gave him the message to speak, yet God used Amos’ human 
personality  and  intelligence  to  convey  that  message.  Amos  talks  about  
a bullock cart full of sheaves of corn, about a shepherd trying to rescue 
bits of a lamb from a lion’s mouth, about ploughing the fields, and about 
caterpillars and locusts. He also talks about the stars, showing that as 
a shepherd in the fields at night, he was a keen observer of God’s vast 
creation.
God gave Amos a message pronouncing judgement on the rich people 
in Israel and their wives who lived in great luxury and ignored the poor. 
So Amos was obviously not a popular preacher!!
Amos was living at a time when Jeroboam was king over Israel (790 to 
750 B.C.). “Jeroboam reigned forty-one years and did evil in the sight of 
the LORD” (2 Kings14:23, 24). This was a relatively peaceful time in Israel. 
Since there was no expense on war, the Israelites expanded their busi-
nesses and became very, very rich. Amos mentions the palatial summer 
houses and winter mansions of the wealthy (3:15). The rich had a house 
in the mountains (for use during the summer) and another in the plains 
(for  use  during  the  winter).  The  leaders  of  Israel  lived  in  luxury,  lying  
on beds of ivory, lazily listening to music, getting drunk, gorging them-
selves  on  tender  meats  and  living  in  gross  immorality  (6:4; 4:1; 2:7). 
On top of all this, they also exploited the poor through exorbitant rents 
and through bribing judges in the courts (5:10, 12). The poor were also 
being sold as slaves (2:6). The rich businessmen eagerly waited for the 
Sabbath  day  to  be  over  each  week,  so  that  they  could  go  out  and  do  
business once again (8:5). All they thought about was money. And their 
wives  were  pampered  drunkards  (4:1).  Nobody  cared  that  the  country  
was being destroyed (6:6). And those who were not rich or influential lost 
out in this system. This is the type of atmosphere in which Communism 

452 Through the Bible: Privilege Brings Dangers and Responsibility
Amos
breeds today. Communism flourishes wherever fantastically rich people 
exploit the poor.
The  amazing  thing  is  that  along  with  all  this  self-indulgence,  they  
also had a lot of religion. They offered sacrifices and thanksgiving offer-
ings regularly and brought their tithes every three days. They had their 
solemn  assemblies,  their  special  meetings  and  their  religious  festivals  
with hymns of praise. They had wonderful times of praise and worship. 
But the Lord rejected all of this as a lot of empty noise (5:21–23).
All this is very similar to what we see in Christendom today. Many rich 
preachers live in grand houses today that have been built with offerings 
taken from poor believers. Rich people are given positions of honour in 
churches merely because of their wealth. Such rich preachers and rich 
people do not like to hear the truth. So Amos had a very difficult ministry.
The Israelites had professional preachers those days too. One of them 
was  Amaziah  who  confronted  Amos  (7:10–16).  Amaziah  was  a  priest  
who was paid a good salary by the rich board-members of the temple 
because he preached sermons that kept them happy. And here came 
this  shepherd-prophet, Amos, an untrained man, who began to thunder 
away  at  all  those  rich  people.  Those  rich  people  became  furious  and  
said,  “Get  this  Amos  out  of  here.  He  is  preaching  false  doctrine  and  
heresies! Throw him out.” Amaziah promptly ordered Amos to get out 
of Israel to please those rich people. And Amaziah suffered the judge-
ment of God in his own family as a result (7:12, 17).
So we see that prophets like Amos have a message that is very relevant 
for our time.
In Chapters  1  and  2  Amos  proclaimed  judgement  on  a  number  of  
nations. In Chapters 3 to 6 he told Israel why they were being judged. And 
finally in Chapters 7 to 9, like many of the other prophets, he prophesied 
the restoration of Israel after the judgement.
Judgement
First,  Amos  pronounced  judgement  on  Damascus,  Gaza,  Tyre,  Edom,  
Ammon  and  Moab  (1:3,  4,  6,  7,  9,  11,  13; 2:1).  I  can  imagine  how  the  
Israelites must have been delighted listening to Amos thundering away 
against  those  nations.  They  would  have  said,  “Amen.  Praise  the  Lord.”  
But after that he said, “Woe unto Judah. Woe unto Israel.” And then the 
“Amens” became silent – because now he was preaching to them.
We all like to hear preachers who tell us what is wrong with the world 
and with other churches! That was how Amos started. He got them all to 
say “Amen” and then homed in on them. He was a wise preacher. He told 
them that they (Judah and Israel) were no different (2:4, 6).
Amos  often  used  the  expression,  “For  three  transgressions  and  for  
four...” (eight times in Chapters 1 and 2). What the Lord meant by that 

Judgement                                                                                                                                                 453
Amos
was, “I have let you off a number of times. But I am not going to let you 
off any more. I have forgiven you many times. But you have been taking 
advantage of My goodness. Now I have to punish you.” This is a word that 
we all need to hear. Do you take advantage of God’s goodness?
Amos’ preaching condemned the people of various nations mainly for 
the cruel way they had treated others. Damascus had taken advantage of 
poor people and “threshed them like grain” (1:3). People had been treated 
like things (grain). It is a common sin among many Christians that they 
love their material possessions much more than they love people. Tyre 
had  broken  their  covenant  of  brotherhood  with  Israel  and  sold  whole  
Israeli  villages  as  slaves  to  Edom  (1:9).  Edom  had  chased  down  their  
Israeli  cousins  with  swords  (1:11). This  is  another  common  sin  among  
Christians  that  they  forget  that  others  in  Christ’s  Body  are  their  own  
brothers and sisters, and betray them to others. Ammon had ripped open 
the pregnant women of Gilead (1:13). Christians today rip people up with 
their tongues. Moab was so angry with the dead king of Edom for some-
thing that had happened when he was alive, that they dug up his bones 
and burned them to ashes (2:1). Christians too often retain anger against 
others for things that happened many years earlier.
Many  of  man’s  actions  are  motivated  by  anger.  Angry  people  tend  to  
be hard on others. We need to take heed to the warning here: “For three 
transgressions and for four...”.  God  has  overlooked  our  anger  many  a  
time and let us go. But now, He says, He will be hard on us if we continue 
to be hard on others.
When  we  studied  Genesis,  we  saw  that  God  never  cursed  Adam  –  
because when Adam sinned, he hurt only himself. But God cursed Cain, 
because Cain hurt another human being. Some sins affect only us. But 
some  sins  affect  others  too.  If  you  drink  alcohol  or  smoke  cigarettes  
or  take  harmful  drugs,  you  basically  hurt  only  yourself  by  such  sins.  
Such sins are not as serious as the sins that hurt others. If you commit 
adultery, you violate a woman’s body and hurt her. This is very serious. 
Equally, if you gossip or speak evil of others, you hurt their reputation. 
This is also very serious. Any sin that hurts another person in any way 
is  very  serious  in  God’s  eyes.  So  gossiping  (that  hurts  others)  is  worse  
than  taking  harmful  drugs  (that  hurts  only  yourself).  But  it  is  almost  
impossible to find a church that teaches that a gossiper is worse than a 
drug-addict!! Unfortunately we don’t have prophets to tell us the truth 
about God’s Word.
See how hard God was on these people! When it came to Judah and 
Israel, see what He said to them: “You have rejected the laws of the Lord. 
You  have  disobeyed  God’s  word”  (2:4).  Those  other  people  didn’t  have  
God’s  laws.  They  treated  others  badly  in  ignorance  of  God’s  laws.  But  
Israel  and  Judah  did  the  same  thing  knowing  God’s  laws.  “Therefore  I  
will send fire on Judah.” The people of Israel had sinned again and again 
(2:6). They had sold poor people for a pair of sandals, trampled helpless 

454 Through the Bible: Privilege Brings Dangers and Responsibility
Amos
people in the dust, denied justice to those who were oppressed, lived in 
adultery  at  their  religious  festivals,  lounged  around  in  clothing  stolen  
from their debtors, and offered wine in the house of God that had been 
purchased with stolen money (2:7, 8). That was like cheating others and 
giving that money for God’s work. Jesus told us to first give to Caesar 
what was Caesar’s and then to give to God what belonged to God. That is 
the order. So he warned all these people and condemned them for their 
attitude.
“I chose some of your sons to be prophets and Nazarites” (2:11). Nazarites 
were those who were set apart to be exclusively God’s – like Samson. “But 
you caused the Nazarites to sin by making them drink wine.” “There were 
a few wholehearted young believers in your church, but you corrupted 
them by your self-seeking, your worldliness and your immoral behaviour. 
Thus those young people backslid.” I believe this has happened in India. 
God calls some young man here or there to be a prophet or a Nazarite, 
separated  to  God,  but  he  gets  corrupted  by  looking  at  the  example  of  
older preachers who are going in the wrong direction. The Lord says to 
those older preachers, “You have destroyed these budding prophets. You 
have destroyed these Nazarites.”
My  word  to  all  of  you  young  people  is  this:  Don’t  look  at  the  bad  
examples among those who are older than you. Follow the examples of 
Christlike leaders and ignore the rest, even if their doctrines are correct. 
Don’t imagine that just because a man’s doctrines are right he is a godly 
man. It’s Christlike character that makes a man a godly man.
Why Israel was Being Judged
In Chapters 3 to 6 Amos told Israel why they were being judged. He asked 
them, “Can two walk together, except they be agreed?” (3:3). How could 
the Lord walk with them, if they were not in total fellowship with Him? 
As long as there were sins in Israel that they had not repented of and set 
right, the Lord would not walk with them. We must agree with the Lord’s 
view of sin in order to fellowship with Him. Amos went on to say, “When 
a lion roars it is because he has found a victim. And if the Lord is roaring 
now in judgment, it is because there is sin in Israel. When disaster comes 
to a city, it is because the Lord sent it – as a judgment” (3:4–6).
A  few  years  after  Amos  preached,  Assyria  came  and  brought  that  
predicted disaster on Israel. The Lord told them in advance that that was 
His punishment to teach them a lesson. But before punishing them, He 
would warn them through His prophets, giving them an opportunity to 
repent (3:7). Today, the Lord warns His people in the churches repeat-
edly through His prophets saying, “Turn from sin. If you don’t, then I will 
chasten you.” The chastening may not come immediately; but it will defi-
nitely come. The judgement on Israel came about 100 years after Amos 
prophesied; but it did come. When Noah proclaimed judgement on the 

Why Israel was Being Judged                                                                                                                  455
Amos
world, it came only 120 years later. Everyone WILL reap what they sow. 
There  will  be  no  escaping  that.  But  God  will  warn  people  through  His  
prophets before He judges.
When  the  lion  roars,  people  should  fear.  When  the  sovereign  Lord  
speaks,  His  servants  must  prophesy  (3:8).  What  the  Lord  was  saying  
was, “If a lion stood in front of you and roared, you would tremble. But 
here I am speaking to you, and you don’t tremble. I am speaking to you 
about the impurity in your thoughts and your eyes, your unrighteous-
ness in money matters, your worship of things other than Me. Yet you 
do not tremble. You are more afraid of a lion that I created than of Me its 
Creator.” People may have said, “Well, that is just Amos and he is just an 
untrained shepherd.” He may have been an untrained shepherd but he 
was a prophet of God!
God’s  people  had  sinned  so  much  that  they  had  actually  “forgotten 
what was right” and what was wrong (3:10).
In Chapter 4, Amos called the women of Israel, “fat cows.” They were 
fat through lots of eating and drinking. Yet they were constantly asking 
their  husbands  for  “yet  another  drink”  (4:1).  Amos  warned  them  that  
someone  would  “put  a  hook  in  their  noses  (these  cows),  and  drag  them  
away” (4:2). The Lord was sharp in His rebukes and His prophet Amos 
did not tone down the Lord’s words to make them more palatable. True 
prophets are usually sharp in their rebukes. Jesus Himself was like that, 
because that is often the only way to alert people to the seriousness of 
the dangers they face. 
The Lord went on to tell them, “You can keep on offering all the sacri-
fices you want, but I don’t care for any of them. I tried to warn you 
through  one  calamity  after  another  that  I  was  not  happy  with  you.  
I brought hunger to one city and famine to another. But you would not 
listen to Me. I sent a dry spell into the fields where you needed rain 
desperately and your crops were ruined. Rain fell on one field but not 
on another. People staggered from town to town for a drink of water but 
there wasn’t enough water. But you would not return to Me. I struck 
your farms and vineyards with blight and sent sicknesses and plagues 
into your midst and even destroyed some of your cities. But in spite 
of all these warnings, you still did not return to Me” (4:4, 6–11). There 
was now only one solution left: “Prepare to meet your God” (4:12).
Today, the Lord’s word to you may perhaps be very similar: “You are 
living in sin and loving this world, yet claiming to be My child and thus 
bringing dishonour to My Name. I have tried My best through the failures 
and chastening I have sent into your life to tell you that I am not happy 
with you. Yet you don’t seem to wake up. Then, prepare to meet your God 
as your Judge.”
“Don’t  go  to  worship  in  Bethel,  Gilgal  or  Beersheba”  (5:5).  These  were  
places where God had worked in the past. There was a history attached 

456 Through the Bible: Privilege Brings Dangers and Responsibility
Amos
to  these  places.  In  Bethel  and  in  Beersheba,  God  had  met  with  Jacob,  
the father of the Israeli nation. Gilgal was the place where their history 
in Canaan had begun, when Joshua circumcised all the people after they 
came through the river Jordan. God was saying, “Don’t live in the past.” 
Don’t say, “The man who founded our church, many years ago was a godly 
man.”  Some  of  these  godly  men  who  founded  churches  200–300  years  
ago, would not join the churches they founded, if they were to return to 
earth today – because their churches have backslidden so badly. Don’t 
look back at the past. See where God is working today.
“O  evil  men,  you  make  justice  a  bitter  pill  for  the  poor.  Righteousness  
and fair play are meaningless fictions to you! How you hate honest 
judges! How you despise people who tell the truth! You trample the poor 
and steal their smallest crumb by all your taxes, fines, and interest; 
therefore, you will never live in the beautiful stone houses you are build-
ing. For many and great are your sins. I know them all so well. You are 
the  enemies  of  everything  good;  you  take  bribes;  you  refuse  justice  to  
the poor. I hate your show and pretense – your hypocrisy of ‘honoring’ 
me with your religious feasts and solemn assemblies. I will not accept 
your burnt offerings and thank offerings. I will not look at your offerings 
of peace. Away with your hymns of praise – they are mere noise to my 
ears. I will not listen to your music, no matter how lovely it is. I want to 
see a mighty flood of justice – a torrent of doing good” (5:7–12, 21–24 - 
TLB). When a believer rents out his house to a poor man, did you know 
that  God  is  interested  in  the  amount  of  rent  he  charges?  God  hates  
those who exploit the poor.
“How terrible it will be for all of you who lounge in luxury and think that 
you are secure” (6:1). In 6:4–6, the Lord is quite sarcastic and tells them 
that they imagine they are as good musicians as David was. But David 
had  a  good  heart,  whereas  these  Israelites  only  had  good  music.  They  
were  happy  that  everything  was  going  well  in  their  homes  –  they  had  
comfortable houses, good music and good food. But how many of them 
were concerned about “Joseph’s affliction” – the sad state of the nation? 
Hardly anyone. In our time, the Lord’s question is “How many of you are 
concerned about the sad state of the church?”
The Lord said, “I despise the pride and the false glory of Israel. I hate 
their beautiful homes” (6:8). Does God hate beautiful homes? No. But He 
does resist people who are proud of their beautiful homes, and especially 
when they are not concerned that the Body of Christ should be pure and 
holy.
Visions of Judgement and Promises of Restoration
In Chapters  7  to  9,  Amos  was  first  shown five visions  of  Israel  being  
judged and then given five promises of Israel’s restoration.

Visions of Judgement and Promises of Restoration                                                                            457
Amos
In 7:1–6, Amos saw visions of a locust-swarm and a great fire coming 
to judge Israel. He immediately interceded for Israel saying, “O sovereign 
Lord, please don’t do this. There will be no hope for Israel if you judge them 
like  that”  God  listened  to  Amos  and  gave  up  His  plans  to  judge  Israel  
–  twice.  This  shows  us  the  tremendous  power  there  is  in  intercession  
(7:6). But prayer according to God’s will requires that we stand with God 
where He stands – and see the seriousness of sin. In Ezekiel’s time later, 
God did not find any intercessor (Ezekiel 22:30). But at this time, He did 
find one – Amos who pleaded with God, just as Moses had pleaded many 
centuries earlier when God had wanted to destroy Israel in the wilder-
ness. These prophets were compassionate men and therefore they were 
great intercessors. It was because of these prophets that Israel was often 
saved from destruction. But Israel did not value them.
The Lord then gave Amos a vision of a plumb-line and told him, “I am 
about to put a plumb line in the midst of My people Israel – to see if they 
are  straightforward,  honest  and  upright  –  I  will  spare  them  no  longer” 
(7:8). God always tests us by His plumb-line to see if we are honest about 
our sins.
We  then  see  a  confrontation  between  Amaziah,  the  priest  of  Bethel,  
(symbolising a Babylonian “Christian” leader) and Amos (symbolising one 
who builds Jerusalem, the true church). Amaziah went to the king and 
told him a lie about Amos saying, “Amos is hatching a plot against you.” 
False prophets are quick to spread lies about the true prophets of God 
saying, “They are preaching false doctrines. If you listen to them, it will 
lead to confusion in your church,” etc. in order to turn people away from 
the truth that can set them free. That happened in Amos’ time, and it has 
happened  time  and  again  during  the  last  2000  years  in  Christendom.  
Amaziah told Amos, “You came from Judah to Israel to preach here. Go 
back to Judah and earn money through your preaching there (“eat bread 
and prophesy there” – 7:12 - KJV). We have more than enough preachers 
here and we don’t want to listen to any of your prophecies here.”
But Amos replied, “Listen, Amaziah, I am not a professional prophet 
like you. I didn’t go to any Bible-school to be trained. I am a shepherd and 
a farmer. I was looking after my flock and my fig trees when God came to 
me one day and told me to go to Israel and prophesy. That’s why I came 
here. I didn’t come here to earn my living or to make money as a prophet. 
And now, Amaziah, since you oppose me, the Lord will judge you. Your 
wife will become a prostitute in this city, your sons and daught ers will be 
killed, and you yourself will die in a foreign land.” (7:14–17).
It is a dangerous thing to fight against the true prophets of God.
Then the Lord gave Amos a vision of ripe fruit symbolising that Israel 
was ripe for punishment (8:2). Why was Israel being punished? The Lord 
says,  “Listen,  you  merchants  who  rob  the  poor,  trampling  on  the  needy;  
you who long for the Sabbath to end and the religious holidays to be over 
so you can get out and start cheating again – using your weighted scales 

458 Through the Bible: Privilege Brings Dangers and Responsibility
Amos
and under-sized measures; you who make slaves of the poor, buying them 
for  their  debt  of  a  piece  of  silver  or  a  pair  of  shoes,  or  selling  them  your  
mouldy  wheat:  The  Lord,  the  Pride  of  Israel,  has  sworn:  ‘I  won’t  forget  
your deeds! The land will tremble as it awaits its doom, and everyone will 
mourn.’ ” (8:4–7).
In 8:11, 12, we read these prophetic words about the last days: “There 
will be a famine in the last days – not a famine of bread but a famine of 
the word of the Lord – and people will wander here and there looking for a 
word from the Lord.” We are seeing that famine today. ‘The Word of God’ 
refers to the Bible – and there is no shortage of that. The Bible Society 
distributes millions of Bibles every year and the Bible is still the world’s 
best-selling book. But here it is speaking about ‘the word of the Lord’ – 
and that refers to the prophetic word that comes from God according to 
the need of the hour through the mouth of a prophet. The “word of the 
Lord” will be rare in the last days. People will wander everywhere to hear 
a true prophet – but they will not be easy to find. So, when you do get an 
opportunity to hear a prophetic word from the Lord, pay attention and 
listen to it carefully – and take it seriously.
When God judges Israel, those who genuinely fear Him will be saved: 
“I have commanded that Israel be sifted by the other nations as grain is 
sifted in a sieve, yet not one true kernel will be lost. But all these sinners 
who  say,  ‘God  will  not  touch  us,’  will  die  by  the  sword.”  Satan  has  a  
sieve with which he seeks to sift God’s children (See Luke 22:31). But 
our Lord prays for us and our faith will not fail.
The Lord then says, “At that time I will rebuild the City of David, which 
is now lying in ruins, and return it to its former glory” (9:11). This verse is 
quoted by James (in Acts 15:16, 17), as referring to the building of the 
church.  The  church  is  in  a  ruined  state  in  many  places.  But  the  Lord  
says, “I will rebuild it.”
And  then  the  time  will  come  when  “the  plowman  will  overtake  the  
reaper” (9:13). What that means is: We have sowed much evil in the past, 
and  although  we  have  been  forgiven,  yet  to  some  extent  we  still  reap  
what we have sown. But the time will soon come when the new things 
that you are sowing in your life (after becoming a wholehearted disciple) 
will  wipe  out  the  things  you  have  been  reaping  (because  of  your  past).  
For  example:  The  dirty  thoughts  and  dreams  that  have  been  plaguing  
your mind because you read and saw so much pornography in the past, 
will  gradually  be  replaced  by  thoughts  and  dreams  of  spiritual  things,  
because you are now filling your mind with the word of God. And your 
life will be fruitful for God.
What a glorious promise that is! Hallelujah!

OBADIAH
Pride and Its Results
T
he  book  of  Obadiah  is  a  very  small  book,  with  just  one  chapter.  
Why did Obadiah write such a small book? The primary reason of 
course, is that God gave him very little to write. But the interesting 
fact is that Obadiah was sensitive enough to stop writing when the Spirit 
had stopped speaking – unlike some preachers who preach long, boring 
sermons imagining that they are “led by the Spirit”!!
Humanly speaking, there could have been another reason too. Obadiah 
was prophesying at the same time as Jeremiah. And he may have felt that 
he should prophesy very little in the presence of the godly Jeremiah who 
had been prophesying for 30 years already. I see a spirit of humility there 
in that attitude of Obadiah’s. This is only a surmise, but that is certainly 
how it should be in a church meeting, or in a time of fellowship among 
believers, today. Less mature brothers must give time to godly brothers 
to speak at length, and speak very little themselves. But unfortunately 
humble brothers, like Obadiah, are rare to find in our day.
The Judgement of Edom 
Obadiah spoke about God’s judgement on Edom. Edom is a type of our 
flesh. So this prophecy symbolises the destruction of the flesh. It speaks 
here about the pride of Edom. “You are proud because you live in those 
high, inaccessible cliffs. ‘Who can ever reach us way up here!’ you boast. 
Don’t fool yourselves! Though you soar as high as eagles, and build your 
nest among the stars, I will bring you plummeting down, says the Lord.” 
(verses 3, 4).
The flesh always seeks to exalt itself. But God is determined to destroy 
that pride completely. If thieves came at night and robbed you they would 
not take everything. But here, “every nook and cranny will be searched 
and  robbed,  and  every  treasure  found  and  taken”  (verse  6  -  TLB).  

460 Through the Bible: Pride and Its Results
Obadiah
The  application  of  this  for  us  is  that  every  little  corner  that  is  called  
“flesh” in us, every lust of the flesh, will be totally destroyed and over-
come by the power of the Spirit.
Edom was being punished because of the violence that they did to their 
close relatives Israel, because in the time of Israel’s greatest need, when 
they were being taken captive, they “deserted Israel in their time of need 
and stood aloof, refusing to lift a finger to help him when invaders carried 
off their wealth” (verses 10, 11). They had acted as if they too were Israel’s 
enemies. Edom did nothing to help Israel.
There are sins of commission as well as sins of omission. Often when 
we think of sin, we think only of the sins that have been committed. 
Notice in the story of the Good Samaritan that the priest and Levite did 
not commit any sin. They did not beat up the wounded man. Their sin 
was that they did not lift a finger to help him (Luke 10:29–37). Do we 
realise that not helping a needy person is a sin? That is a sin of omis-
sion.  Edom  did  NOT  do  what  they  should  have  done  –  and  the  Lord  
took it seriously.
Edom’s second sin was that they gloated over Israel’s capture (verse 12). 
When  something  bad  happens  to  somebody  you  don’t  like,  do  you  feel  
happy? That is sin. We are not to rejoice over someone else’s misfortune.
But that was not all. Edom attacked those helpless Israelites and cut 
them  down  at  the  crossroads  (verse  14).  They  cooperated  with  Israel’s  
enemies.
The Restoration of Israel
Finally  the  Lord  spoke  about  the  restoration  of  Israel.  Almost  all  the  
prophets  spoke  about  restoration.  “Jerusalem  will  become  a  refuge  for  
those  who  escape”  one  day  (verse  17).  It  will  be  a  holy  place.  And  the  
people of Israel will come back to reclaim their inheritance. At that time 
Israel will become a flaming fire for the Lord, and Edom a field of dry 
stubble (verse 18). “Deliverers will come to Jerusalem and rule all Edom 
(the flesh). And the Lord shall be King!” (verse 21).
Today, God has called us to be those deliverers, proclaiming to God’s 
backslidden people, “Behold your King!” and inviting them to come back 
to Him.
What was the cause of Edom’s fall? “The pride of your heart has deceived 
you”  (verse  3).  When  we  are  proud,  we  open  ourselves  to  spiritual  
deception  –  because  pride  is  the  very  nature  of  Satan,  the  deceiver.  
The moment you become proud of something – good looks, intelligence, 
spirituality,  Bible  knowledge,  anything  –  immediately  the  devil  holds  
your hand and says, “You and I are in fellowship now.” Jesus Christ, 

The Restoration of Israel                                                                                                                         461
Obadiah
on the other hand, was the humblest Man that walked on earth; and 
the moment you humble yourself, you come into fellowship with Him.
Pride is more dangerous than adultery because adultery is an outward 
sin – and sins that are outward and obvious are not as serious as sins 
that are hidden. Obadiah warns those who are complacent in their pride 
that  they  are  deceived.  Let  us  learn  from  his  brief  exhortation  to  be  
concerned about those who are in captivity to their flesh, around us, and 
to proclaim to them that Jesus can deliver them completely.
If  we  do  that,  then  Obadiah  would  not  have  written  his  one  page  in  
vain.



JONAH
God’s Love for All Nations
T
here  are  16  prophetic  books  in  the  Old  Testament  (Isaiah  to  
Malachi). Out of those 16 prophets, Jonah was the only one who 
did not prophesy anything either to Israel or to Judah. He proph-
esied only to Nineveh. The book of Jonah is not really a prophecy, but a 
book of history.
Jonah  may  have  written  it  himself  in  the  third  person.  It  is  a  story  
that illustrates God’s tremendous love for all people. Jonah is the great 
missionary book of the Old Testament. It shows the narrow-heartedness 
of the Jewish people and the large-heartedness of God – and His concern 
and love for even the most wicked nation on earth – which at that time 
was Assyria, whose capital was Nineveh.
When  God  needed  a  messenger  to  go  to  Nineveh,  He  picked  Jonah.  
That was a tremendous honour – for Jonah would be the first prophet 
of God to the outside world – to the non-Jewish nations. But he almost 
missed that privilege by his disobedience.
We  see  here  again  how  God  is  dependent  on  a  human  channel  to  
convey  His  message.  And  if  the  messenger  is  not  willing  to  cooperate,  
God is limited. God has to wait until the vessel is ready – as in the case 
of Moses. When Israel was ready to be delivered from Egypt, Moses was 
not ready. And so Israel had to wait for their deliverance until God had 
finished preparing Moses.
We see something similar here. God wanted to give Nineveh a message. 
But he had to prepare His servant first to take that message. Jonah was 
prejudiced against the Assyrians and was unwilling to go to them, just as 
Peter later was unwilling to go to the Gentiles – to the house of Cornelius. 
Prejudice is a very strong thing. All of us have certain prejudices. And if 
God is not able to break down those prejudices, our service for the Lord 
will be limited. God may still use us, but He will be limited in how much 
He can use us, because His heart is much larger than ours.

464 Through the Bible: God’s Love for All Nations
Jonah
Nineveh  was  about  600  kilometres  east  of  Israel.  That  was  a  long  
distance for Jonah to travel. But that was not the primary reason why 
he did not want to go there. Everyone in the world hated the Assyrians, 
because they were so cruel. And Jonah did not want the wicked Assyrians 
to repent of their sins, because He knew that if they repented, God would 
spare them – and then they would come and destroy Israel.
Jonah’s First Commission
There are two sections in this book. The first two chapters deal with 
Jonah’s first commission and the next two chapters deal with his second 
commission.
The Lord told Jonah, “Go to Nineveh and cry against the city, because 
their wickedness has come up before Me” (1:1, 2). But Jonah, instead of 
going east, went west. He went to Joppa, found a ship, paid the fare, and 
went down to Tarshish, fleeing from the presence of the Lord (1:3).
Because Jonah had money to travel, he missed the will of God. How 
blessed it would have been for him if he did not have any money to buy 
a ticket to Tarshish. When God tells us to go somewhere and we want to 
go somewhere else, it will be good if we don’t have the money to travel to 
the place of our choice.
Many  Christian  workers  feel  that  if  they  have  the  money  to  travel  
somewhere, that indicates that it is God’s will. If that argument were a 
valid one, then Jonah was in the will of God when he left for Tarshish!! 
Just because you have the money to buy something or to go somewhere, 
does not mean that that is God’s will for you. God may not want you to 
buy that thing and He may want you to go to some other place. Money is 
a great deceiver. Never allow the availability of money to be the deciding 
factor in deciding where to go or what to buy.
When Jonah went away from the will of God, the Lord hurled a great 
wind on the sea and a great storm, and the ship was about to break up. 
The sailors were afraid and each cried out to his god but the storm did 
not subside. While the others were praying to their idols, the only one on 
that ship who knew the true God was sleeping. They woke him up and 
asked him to pray too. Then they cast lots to find out whose fault it was 
that their prayers were not being answered. God sovereignly controlled 
that lot so that it fell on Jonah. The others in the ship were far greater 
sinners than Jonah; yet the storm came because of Jonah! Disobedience 
in a child of God is more serious in God’s eyes than multitudes of sins 
in an unbeliever. “Of all the peoples of the earth, I have chosen you alone. 
That is why I must punish you the more for all your sins” (Amos 3:2).
Jonah then admitted his sin. He told them that he was running away 
from God. They tried their best to row to the shore but couldn’t succeed, 
since the sea was very stormy. Then Jonah said, “Please pick me up and 
throw me outside into the sea and it will stop, because I know this storm 

Jonah’s First Commission                                                                                                                        465
Jonah
has come upon you because of me” (verse 12). Then those seamen were 
afraid  that  God  would  punish  them  if  they  threw  Jonah  into  the  sea.  
Those heathen men seem to have more of the fear of God here than God’s 
prophet. Finally, since there was no other way, they picked up Jonah and 
threw him into the sea – and immediately the storm subsided. And “the 
men feared the Lord” (verse 16).
Meanwhile, the Lord had appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah, and 
Jonah was in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights. 
God’s word is inspired and I believe it just as it is written. Jesus Himself 
endorsed this true story when He said, “As Jonah was in the belly of the 
great fish, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth” (Matthew 
12:40). Paradise was located in the heart of the earth before the resur-
rection  and  ascension  of  Jesus  –  and  Jesus  was  there,  in  paradise,  in  
the heart of the earth, for three days and three nights – from Thursday 
evening (yes, He WAS crucified on a Thursday) until Sunday morning 
when He was raised from the dead.
After three days, Jonah prayed. Notice the word “THEN” in 2:1. That 
word makes it clear that Jonah did not pray during the first three days 
and nights. So what was he doing during those three days and nights? 
He  was  most  probably  trying  to  crawl  out  of  the  stomach  of  the  great  
fish. He must have tried again and again and always slipped back into 
the fish’s slimy belly. After three days of futile effort, he finally decided 
to pray.
That is how it is with us too, when we find ourselves trapped in a diffi-
cult situation. The first thing we usually do is to try and get out of it 
by some human effort. When all our efforts fail, then we pray! And so 
Jonah  prayed  after  3  days.  Still  nothing  happened.  He  says,  “I  was  
locked out of life and imprisoned in the land of death. When I had lost 
all hope, I turned my thoughts once more to the Lord. And my earnest 
prayer  went  to  you  in  your  holy  Temple”  (2:6,  7).  Nothing  happened  
even after his prayer. Finally, he stopped praying and started praising 
the Lord. He said, “I will sacrifice to You with the voice of thanksgiving. 
Salvation is from the Lord (Deliverance can come only from You)” (2:9). 
In other words, he was saying, “Lord, I am going to praise You with all 
of my heart. You can deliver me if and when You like.”
As soon as he started praising God, the Lord commanded the fish to 
vomit Jonah out on to the land. Notice the word “THEN” again in 2:10. That 
makes it clear that it was only when he started praising the Lord, that the 
Lord commanded the fish to vomit him out. There is a principle here. We 
saw this principle when we were studying Psalm 50:23: “Whoever offers 
a sacrifice of thanksgiving (the same phrase Jonah uses here) makes a 
way thereby for Me to show him My deliverance.” In other words, the Lord 
says, “If you start praising Me instead of just complaining, you will make 

466 Through the Bible: God’s Love for All Nations
Jonah
a  way  for  Me  to  deliver  you.”  We  have  seen  how  Jehoshaphat  followed  
that  principle  too.  Surrounded  by  great  armies  he  began  to  praise  the  
Lord and thus God delivered him from his enemies (2 Chronicles 20:22).
Prayer  by  itself  is  not  necessarily  an  expression  of  faith,  but  sincere  
praise to God is always the expression of faith (See Psalm 106:12). You 
may pray without faith. But if you praise God, when the situation is not 
yet resolved, then you are expressing your faith. When you say, “I praise 
You,  Lord,  for  I  know  that  deliverance  comes  only  from  You”,  you  have  
expressed Your faith in God and made a way for Him to deliver you.
Jonah’s Second Commission
Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time. Praise the Lord 
that when we fail once, the Lord gives us a second chance. That is one 
of  the  great  messages  that  comes  to  us  from  the  book  of  Jonah.  Have  
you failed the Lord? God is waiting to give you another chance. Have you 
failed Him a second time? He will give you a third chance. He is not only 
the  God  of  the  second  chance  –  for  most  of  us  have  blown  our  second  
chance long, long ago. He is the God of another chance, no matter how 
many  times  you  have  failed!  The  Lord  can  restore  you  even  now  and  
enable you to fulfil a ministry for Him, if you repent wholeheartedly.
Jonah had learned his lesson now. He had been chastened and now 
he went to Nineveh gladly. It took him three days to walk through that 
huge city, proclaiming in every street that Nineveh would be overthrown 
in 40 days. Amazingly, the people of Nineveh repented immediately. This 
was the greatest and quickest revival that ever took place in the history of 
the world – and it took place in a heathen nation. Such a revival has never 
been seen anywhere. Jonah’s sermon consisted of only one sentence. But 
it brought conviction to thousands – and they ALL repented.
What  do  we  see  here?  When  God  has  successfully  dealt  with  His  
servant and done a work in him, even one sentence from his mouth has 
such tremendous power. If God has not succeeded in dealing with your 
stubbornness,  your  disobedience,  your  rebellion  and  your  pride,  then  
even  long  sermons  you  preach  won’t  accomplish  anything.  But  if  God  
has succeeded in breaking you, then even one sentence will be powerful. 
From the king down to the beggar there was much weeping and repent-
ing. They put on sackcloth and called upon God to forgive them. They knew 
they would be judged. And when God saw that, He did not punish them.
One of the things that encourages me here is that even when a wicked 
city like Nineveh repented, God was merciful. God knew that some years 
later, the city would be so evil that He would have to destroy it. But God 
treats everyone as they are right now – and not as they were in the past or 
as they will be in the future. His Name is “I AM”, not “I was” nor “I will be”.
God  is  more  compassionate  than  we  are.  There  is  not  a  single  case  
in  Scripture  where  a  person  repented  and  turned  to  God,  where  God  

Jonah’s Second Commission                                                                                                                   467
Jonah
did not  forgive.  Even  if  Judas  Iscariot  had  gone  to  the  Lord  and  asked  
for forgiveness, he would have been forgiven. But he went to the priests 
instead  –  like  many  do  today!  You  can’t  get  forgiveness  by  confessing  
your sins to any priest. Judas Iscariot tried it and was not forgiven. And 
you won’t be forgiven that way either.
When God had mercy on Nineveh, one would have thought that Jonah 
would have been excited. But he wasn’t. Imagine an evangelist who sees 
an entire city of over 120,000 people (4:11) weeping and repenting – the 
greatest revival in history – and not being excited! Jonah became angry 
instead. First of all, because his prophecy was not fulfilled. Secondly, 
because  as  a  patriotic  Israeli,  he  hated  the  people  of  Nineveh  and  had  
hoped that they would not repent and that God would destroy them.
Are we like Jonah? Is there anyone on earth whom you do NOT want 
God to bless? Have we forgotten how merciful God has been to us and 
how He has blessed us even when we deserved only Hell. But Jonah 
was now concerned about his own honour and reputation as a prophet.
To teach Jonah a lesson, the Lord allowed a plant to grow up over his 
head.  Jonah  was  very  happy  for  the  plant.  But  the  next  day,  because  
God  made  a  worm  eat  up  the  plant,  it  withered  up.  Jonah  was  very  
angry again because the sun was beating down on him and he said, “It 
is better for me to die than live” (4:8). Then God said to Jonah, “You had 
compassion on a plant which came up overnight and perished overnight. 
Should  I  not  have  compassion  on  Nineveh,  the  great  city  in  which  there  
are more than 120,000 persons who do not know the difference between 
their right and left hand, as well as many animals?” (4:11). God expressed 
His concern for more than 120,000 innocent babies in Nineveh besides 
many animals. It is amazing to see God’s concern here for the animals 
in  Nineveh!  “A  good  man  is  concerned  for  the  welfare  of  his  animals” 
(Proverbs 12:10 - TLB).
In this verse (Jonah 4:11) – more than in any other verse in the Old 
Testament – we see God’s tremendous compassion for lost souls. God so 
loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that no one should 
perish.  Jonah  somehow  did  not  get  into  fellowship  with  God  in  this  
matter. There are many preachers today too who preach and see reviv-
als (like Jonah did), but who like Jonah, are not in fellowship with the 
compassionate heart of God. Such preachers do not fulfil their ministry 
as God wants them to. You may preach and get people saved; and yet at 
the end of it all, like Jonah, you may have no fellowship with God at all. 
The proper basis for an evangelistic ministry is fellowship with the heart 
of God. God has such a great compassion for those who don’t have light.
The Bible says God wants all men to repent, to be saved and to come to 
the knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4). He longs for that. The more 

468 Through the Bible: God’s Love for All Nations
Jonah
we come into fellowship with God’s heart, the more we will share His 
burden. If God has called you to be an evangelist, He will give you a 
compassion for lost souls. If God calls you to be a teacher, He will give 
you  a  compassion  for  believers  who  are  blinded  and  deceived,  who  
are not entering into a life of victory. Fellowship with the heart of God 
in sharing His compassion is essential if we are to fulfil our ministry 
effectively.

MICAH
Corrupt Leaders and  
God’s Authority
M
icah  lived  at  the  same  time  as  Isaiah.  He  prophesied  to  both  
Israel and Judah. He preached primarily to the religious leaders 
in Israel and Judah who had misused their privileges in serving 
God  and  exploited  the  poor  people  in  their  congregations  exactly  like  
many  Christian  leaders  exploit  poor  people  today.  It  is  amazing  to  see  
how many Old Testament prophets had a concern for these poor people 
in Israel and Judah who were being deceived and led astray by covetous, 
selfish, proud leaders.
God’s Judgement on Samaria and Judah
In the first three chapters we read of God’s judgement on Samaria (capital 
of Israel) and Judah. 
Micah called the people to listen to him because the Lord was coming 
down to accuse them (1:2).
In Chapter 2 we see the sins that the leaders were guilty of. Wherever 
God’s Word speaks to leaders, it is good for all of us who are elders and 
preachers of God’s Word to examine ourselves and judge ourselves. 
“How terrible it will be for you who lie awake at night thinking up evil 
plans. You rise at dawn and hurry up to carry out those schemes that 
you  have  the  power  to  accomplish.  When  you  want  a  certain  piece  of  
land, you find a way to seize it. When you find somebody’s house, you 
find a way to get it – by fraud. No one’s family or inheritance is safe with 
people like you around” (2:1, 2).

470 Through the Bible: Corrupt Leaders and God’s Authority 
Micah
Here were religious leaders who were using their power to exploit the 
poor and rob them of their money! We could apply this today to preachers 
who urge poor people and widows to pay their tithes, and then use these 
gifts to live in luxury themselves.
It is true that the Lord has permitted those who preach the gospel to get 
their living from the gospel (1 Corinthians 9:14). But it is totally wrong for 
a preacher to get his living from people who earn less than him. How can 
a preacher receive money from someone who is poorer than him and use 
it to live at a higher standard than that poor person? Jesus would never 
have  done  that.  Yet,  that  is  exactly  what  many  Christian  pastors  and  
preachers  are  doing  today.  They  receive  money  from  people  who  live  in  
small houses and use that money to build grand houses for themselves. 
They  take  tithes  from  people  who  earn  so  little  and  live  at  a  standard  
many  times  higher  than  those  who  gave  them  the  money.  This  is  why  
God’s grace departs from them, even if they are still gifted to preach.
A  Christian  worker  must  never  receive  money  for  his  personal  
needs,  from  anyone  who  earns  less  than  him.  Poor  people  have  a  
right to give money for the Lord’s work. But if they give you money, you 
must put it into the offering box for the Lord’s work and never use it for 
your personal needs. If you honour God in this way, He will bless you and 
provide all your need. But most preachers are not serious about small 
things like this.
Jesus  received  money  from  some  who  supported  His  ministry  (Luke 
8:1–3). But He never used that money to live in grand style. There was 
plenty  of  money  in  Judas  Iscariot’s  bag  and  Jesus  could  have  used  it  
as He liked. But He would not use a poor man’s money to live in a hotel 
(inn) that that poor person himself could not afford. So He slept under 
the trees in the Mount of Olives at times (John 7:53 to 8:2). There is some-
thing we can learn from His example.
If you are faithful in the use of God’s money, you will retain the anoint-
ing of God upon you till the end of your life. But if you, as a preacher, 
are  unfaithful  with  God’s  money,  you  will  fall  from  grace  like  many  
other preachers have fallen, all over the world. The Lord says, “I will 
reward your evil with evil. You won’t be able to escape” (2:3). He who 
has ears to hear, let him hear.
But the people said, “Don’t say such things. Such disasters will never 
come  our  way”  (2:6).  But  Micah  replied,  “Will  the  Lord  have  patience  
with your behaviour? You steal the shirts right off the backs of those who 
trusted  you.  You  evict  women  from  their  homes  and  strip  their  children  
of their God-given rights. You have filled the land with sin and ruined it 
completely. If a prophet full of lies were to say to you, ‘I’ll preach to you 
about the joys of wine and drink’, that’s just the kind of prophet you would 
like!” (2:7–11).

God’s Judgement on Samaria and Judah                                                                                              471
Micah
Throughout history it has been true that the people of God have always 
preferred  false  prophets  who  tickle  their  ears  and  say  things  to  make  
them  happy.  Most  of  God’s  people  have  never  cared  to  listen  to  God’s  
true  prophets  who  tell  them  the  truth.  So  if  you  are  a  servant  of  God  
who wants to preach God’s word faithfully, remember one thing: You will 
never be popular. You won’t be able to make money. You will be despised 
and rejected like these Old Testament prophets were. 
In spite of all this, the Lord still told Israel, “I will gather a few of you 
who  are  left  and  I  will  bring  you  together”  (2:12).  Most  of  the  prophets  
prophesied  that  there  would  be  a  remnant  of  people  whom  God  would  
bring back to Jerusalem from Babylon.
This is true even today. Even though most of Christendom is in a back-
slidden condition, there is a remnant of God-fearing people on earth who 
are witnesses to the truth. If you are a God-fearing person, you should 
look for that remnant wherever you go. Look for those who are sincerely 
seeking after God and who are leaving Babylonian systems. They won’t 
be  found  in  any  one  denomination.  In  one  town  they  may  be  found  in  
one church. And in another town, they may not be found in the branch 
of that first church. There is no “remnant denomination” anywhere in the 
world today – only local “remnant churches”. So in every place, you must 
ask, “Lord, where are Your people gathering in this place?” And He will 
lead you to them.
“Listen,  you  leaders  of  Israel  –  you  are  supposed  to  know  right  from  
wrong. Yet you are the very ones who hate good and love evil; you skin 
my people and strip them to the bone. You devour them, flog them, break 
their bones, and chop them up like meat for the cooking pot – and then 
you  plead  with  the  Lord  for  his  help  in  times  of  trouble!  Do  you  really  
expect him to listen? He will look the other way! You false prophets! You 
who lead his people astray! You who cry “Peace” to those who give you 
food and threaten those who will not pay! This is God’s message to you: 
‘The night will close about you and cut off all your visions; darkness will 
cover you with never a word from God. The sun will go down upon you, 
and your day will end. Then at last you will cover your faces in shame 
and admit that your messages were not from God.’ ” (3:1–7 - TLB).
History repeats itself. 2600 years ago, preachers loved those who gave 
them large gifts, and prophesied comforting messages to them. The same 
thing is happening today!! But if someone was poor and could not invite 
these  preachers  for  a  good  meal,  they  threatened  them.  Such  are  not  
servants of God but false prophets.
They prophesied falsely, claiming to have seen visions from God, just 
like many deceivers do today. But God’s message to them was: “The night 
will close about you and cut off all your visions; darkness will cover you 
with never a word from God. The sun will go down upon you, and your day

Micah
will end. Then at last you will cover your faces in shame and admit that 
your messages were not from God” (3:6, 7).
Micah was filled with the Spirit and fearless in rebuking such false 
prophets:  “I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the Lord, fearlessly 
announcing God’s punishment on Israel for her sins.” (3:8).
That  may  sound  like  boasting,  but  it  was  not.  Micah  was  drawing  a  
contrast  between  him  and  the  other  preachers  of  his  time.  Centuries  
later, the apostle Paul also drew such a contrast between him and others. 
Paul  said,  “I  preached  God’s  Good  News  to  you  without  charging  you  
anything. Why? I do it to cut out the ground from under the feet of those 
who boast that they are doing God’s work in just the same way we are. 
God never sent those men at all; they are “phonies” who have fooled you 
into thinking they are Christ’s apostles.” (2 Corinthians 11:7–13). Paul did 
not serve God for money like the false apostles of his time and like most 
preachers today.
Micah  had  a  lot  to  say  to  those  who  preached  for  money.  “Listen  to  
me, you leaders of Israel who hate justice and love unfairness, and fill 
Jerusalem  with  murder  and  sin  of  every  kind  –  you  leaders  who  take  
bribes; you priests and prophets who won’t preach and prophesy until 
you’re paid. (And yet you fawn upon the Lord and say, “All is well – the 
Lord is here among us. No harm can come to us.”) It is because of you 
that Jerusalem will be plowed like a field and become a heap of rubble” 
(3:9–12).
The Old Testament prophets spoke a lot about the corruption among 
the preachers in those days, because that was what was destroying God’s 
people. It is the same today. The priests and prophets preached only if 
they were paid. Yet all of them claimed to be depending on the Lord. This 
is the type of deception being practised today as well.
A servant of the Lord is entitled to receive voluntary gifts given to him. 
But there is a vast difference between that and being paid a salary for 
“serving God”! What is the difference between a salary and a gift? You can 
expect a salary but you can’t expect a gift. A true servant of the Lord will 
continue to serve Him, whether he gets money or not, whether he gets 
food or not. He is thankful for gifts, but he is not dependent on them. He 
does not serve the Lord for money. If you follow this principle, God will 
provide all your needs, in one way or the other, and you will be protected 
from the snares that many preachers have fallen into.
The Coming of the Kingdom and the King
In the first seven verses of Chapter 4, Micah speaks of the millennial reign 
of Christ. For the first time, Micah prophesies here about the future. 
But  before  that  happens,  Micah  prophesies  the  Babylonian  captivity  
of  God’s  people:  “O  people  of  Zion,  you  must  leave  this  city  and  live  in  

God’s Controversy With His People                                                                                                       473
Micah
the fields; you will be sent far away into exile in Babylon. But there I will 
rescue you and free you from the grip of your enemies” (4:10).
Micah  prophesied  this  100  years  before  it  actually  happened  –  that  
Babylon  which  was  then  a  small,  unknown  country  would  become  a  
super-power and take Judah captive.
Chapter 5:1, is a dual prophecy – first about Zedekiah, the last king of 
Judah, who would be taken captive into Babylon: “With a rod they will 
smite the judge (Ruler) of Israel on the cheek.” Secondly, about the true 
King of Israel – Jesus – Who would be smitten on His cheek. This Ruler 
would  be  born  in  Bethlehem:  “Bethlehem,  you  are  but  a  small  Judean  
village, yet you will be the birthplace of my King who is alive from everlast-
ing ages past!” (5:2). After Zedekiah was taken captive to Babylon, there 
were no kings in Judah for more than 500 years. The next king was One 
Who was born in Bethlehem. This verse in Micah was what the priests 
quoted to Herod when the wise men asked him, “Where is He that is born 
King of the Jews?” (Matthew 2:2).
Then Micah speaks about the remnant. The prophets always return to 
the subject of the remnant, after prophesying judgement. “The remnant of 
Jacob will be among many peoples like dew from the Lord, like showers....
They will be among the nations, like a lion among the beasts of the forest....
Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries and all your enemies 
will be cut off.” (5:7-9). That’s how the remnant-church should be today – 
refreshing others as dew and showers do, dignified in conduct as a lion, 
and overcoming Satan and fleshly lusts (the real enemies).
God’s Controversy With His People
In Chapter 6, we read about God’s controversy with His people. This is 
like a court scene where God says as it were to Israel, “Stand up and state 
your  case  against  Me.  Let  the  mountains  and  hills  be  witnesses  to  your  
complaints. And I will also state My case against you. What have I done to 
you that you turn away from Me? I brought you out of Egypt and redeemed 
you from your slavery. I sent Moses, Aaron and Miriam to lead you. When 
Balaam tried to curse, I blessed you instead? What have you got against 
Me then, that you turn away from Me?” (6:1–5).
And then Micah asks the people what their response should be to God. 
Do they imagine that God is looking for more offerings from them? No. 
He doesn’t want their tithes or offerings. Even the offering of a firstborn 
child (the most precious earthly offering possible) would not be able to 
atone for even one of their sins.
And then we read one of the most beautiful verses in the book of Micah 
which  tells  us  what  God  has  required  from  man  at  all  times  –  a  verse  
that we should all keep in mind at all times: “What does the LORD require 
of you but to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your 
God?” (6:8).

474 Through the Bible: Corrupt Leaders and God’s Authority 
Micah
If you are really grateful to the Lord for all that He has done for you, 
then  what  He  wants  from  you  is  not  your  money  or  your  service,  but  
these three things, first of all:
1. Do justice. Be free from all partiality and do what is right in every situ-
ation, and never do any wrong to others. 
2. Love mercy. Rejoice in forgiving others their wrongs and in doing good 
to  them.  Treat  everyone  mercifully.  Don’t  be  hard  on  anyone  who  
makes a mistake. You have made mistakes too and God has forgiven 
you. So forgive everyone and do all the good you can, to all the people 
you can, at all the times you can. Make allowance for the fact that they 
may not have all the light you have in many areas and so be willing to 
accept their doing things differently from you, without judging them. 
Those who judge others will be dealt with unmercifully by God in the 
final day (James 2:13).
3. Walk humbly with God. This is the secret of it all. A humble attitude 
will bring the grace of God upon you and will enable you to live the 
kind of life that God requires. Otherwise you will find it impossible. To 
walk humbly with God is to recognise that without Christ you can do 
nothing. It means seeing yourself as a nobody in your own eyes – even 
though you are a very valuable somebody in God’s eyes.
There are two types of religions in the world – one that majors on reli-
gious rituals (6:6, 7) and another that majors on loving God and loving 
one’s neighbour (6:8) – for that is what the three things mentioned above 
really  boil  down  to.  All  false  religions  and  most  Christians  prefer  the  
former. True disciples choose the latter. 
External rituals can often become a substitute for walking humbly with 
God and walking in love and mercy with our neighbours. If the leaders 
of Israel had concentrated on these three matters and taught others 
to do the same, Israel would never have gone as captives to Babylon.
Micah  then  prophesies  against  the  businessmen  who  were  cheating  
poor people: “Is there to be no end of your getting rich by cheating? Your 
homes  are  full  of  ungodly  treasures  and  lying  scales.  You  have  become  
wealthy through extortion and violence; you are so used to lying that your 
tongues can’t tell the truth! Therefore you will eat but never have enough. 
And though you try and try to save your money, it will come to nothing at 
the  end,  and  what  little  you  succeed  in  storing  up  I’ll  give  to  those  who  
conquer you” (6:10–14).
If you are rich, God wants to know how you made your money. Did you 
cheat anyone to get it? Did you cheat the government of taxes that were 
due to it? Did you do anything unrighteous to earn it? God keeps a close 
watch on how His people earn their money. Dishonestly earned wealth 
will only bring the judgement of God on us.

God’s Controversy With His People                                                                                                       475
Micah
God says, “It is as hard to find an honest man as grapes and figs when 
harvest days are over. The godly person has perished from the land, and 
there is no upright person. They even turn against their own brothers. As 
for  evil,  both  hands  do  it  well:  The  judge  demands  bribes  and  the  rich 
man pays him and tells him whom to ruin. Thus justice is twisted between 
the two, as they both weave together” (7:1–3). God then warns them that 
the time of their punishment has drawn near (7:4).
We live in a similar situation today. Godly men are rare to find every-
where. There is a lot of injustice and bribery in society and poor people 
are  being  exploited.  God  is  watching  all  this.  He  waited  a  long  time  in  
Israel before He judged them. Those who are doing all this today will not 
escape. One day God will make people account for every single bribe they 
took to pervert justice and for every wrong they ever did to harm others 
– especially the helpless poor. No-one will escape. Everyone will have to 
give an account of himself to God.
Micah’s words in 7:6 was quoted and expanded by Jesus as follows: 
“Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to 
bring  peace,  but  a  sword.  For  I  came  to  set  a  man  against  his  father,  
and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her 
 mother-in-law; and a man’s enemies will be the members of his house-
hold. He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; 
and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me” 
(Matthew 10:34–37).
When you read Micah 7:6, it doesn’t look as if it refers to discipleship at 
all. But Jesus’ use of it teaches us that the words of these prophets had 
more than one meaning. Many prophecies have a double fulfilment. And 
here is just one of those examples.
Micah  then  spoke  some  wonderful  words  which  we  can  use  in  our  
spiritual battles with Satan: 
“As for me, I look to the Lord for his help; I wait for God to save me; He 
will hear me. Do not rejoice against me, O my enemy, for though I fall, 
I   will  rise  again!  When  I  sit  in  darkness,  the  Lord  himself  will  be  my  
Light.  I  will  be  patient  while  the  Lord  punishes  me,  for  I  have  sinned  
against Him; then He will defend me from my enemies and punish them 
for all the evil they have done to me. God will bring me out of my dark-
ness into the light, and I will see His goodness. Then my enemy will see 
that God is for me and be ashamed for taunting, ‘Where is that God of 
yours?’ Now with my own eyes I see him trampled down like mud in the 
street” (7:7–10).
Those are words that we can speak to the devil when we have fallen 
into sin, or failed the Lord in some way, or when we are being chastened 

476 Through the Bible: Corrupt Leaders and God’s Authority 
Micah
by  the  Lord.  Don’t  ever  let  Satan  discourage  you  by  saying,  “You  have  
fallen. There is no hope for you now.” Memorise this portion of Scripture 
and quote it to Satan whenever needed.
Micah concludes his prophecy praising God for His wonderful mercy: 
“Where is there a god who can compare with You – wiping the slate clean 
of  our  guilt,  turning  a  blind  eye  and  a  deaf  ear  to  the  past  sins  of  your  
purged and precious people? You don’t nurse Your anger and don’t stay 
angry  long,  for  mercy  is  Your  specialty.  That’s  what  You  love  most;  and  
compassion  is  on  its  way  to  us.  You’ll  stamp  out  our  wrongdoing.  You’ll  
sink  our  sins  to  the  bottom  of  the  ocean.  You’ll  stay  true  to  your  word” 
(7:18–20 - Paraphrase).
That is another passage of Scripture that encourages all who feel they 
have failed the Lord. 
The prophets always had a word of encouragement and hope for God’s 
people after preaching judgement and punishment for sin. And that is an 
example for all of us who preach God’s Word. How should we conclude 
our  messages,  when  we  have  to  preach  a  strong  word  of  judgement  or  
rebuke? Always with a word of encouragement, that God is on the side 
of His people. 
Remember that God is always on your side against the devil. He will 
never be on the devil’s side against you no matter how much you have 
sinned. He waits for you to repent. But He will always stand by you. 
The moment He sees you turn towards Him, He runs to assist you.
You  who  preach  the  word  of  God  are  like  surgeons  in  an  operating  
theatre seeking to remove a cancer from a patient. You cut the person 
open  and  expose  the  cancer.  What  should  you  do  then?  Remove  the  
cancer, stitch him up, give him a painkiller, and send him home happy 
and rejoicing! But a lot of preachers just cut the person open and expose 
the cancer and then send the person home with his stomach cut open – 
discouraged and without hope! 
Don’t ever do that. Complete the job. Even if people have been convicted 
and have wept for their sins, let them go home rejoicing with hope in their 
hearts!  Let  your  preaching  be  always  like  that  of  these  Old  Testament  
prophets ending with a word of hope. 
God is always on your side against the devil.

NAHUM 
God’s Anger and Vengeance
M
ost Christians never read these “minor” prophets because they feel 
they will not get anything out of them. But all Scripture is inspired 
by  God.  Every  part  of  Scripture  is  not  of  equal  value.  The  New  
Testament is certainly far more important than the Old Testament – but 
there is something of value in every Old Testament book. These proph-
ets repeated certain things for the sake of emphasis. When a subject is 
repeated in Scripture, we can know from that, that God considers that 
subject important. God may speak on ten different subjects, but repeat 
two or three of those – because those two or three are of special impor-
tance. Most preachers, however, are reluctant to repeat their messages 
lest  they  lose  their  reputation  for  preaching  a  new  message  each  time.  
That  is  why  most  of  today’s  preachers  can  never  be  prophets!  The  Old  
Testament  prophets,  however,  did  not  seek  their  own  reputation.  They  
spoke  whatever  God  told  them  to  say.  God  knows  exactly  what  people  
need, and if the people needed to hear something for the twentieth time, 
the prophet would repeat it for the twentieth time.
Nahum lived 100 years after Jonah. He was speaking at a time when 
Assyria was the most powerful nation on earth. For a prophet to say then 
that  God  was  going  to  destroy  the  most  powerful  nation  on  the  earth  
was  as  ridiculous  as  someone  proclaiming  today  that  the  USA  would  
be  destroyed  and  reduced  to  nothing!  Nobody  would  believe  that.  And  
nobody  believed  Nahum  then.  But  as  we  look  back  over  history  today,  
we see that what the prophets predicted happened exactly. Every word of 
theirs was fulfilled exactly concerning the great world empires of Assyria, 
Egypt,  Babylon  and  Tyre.  The  empires  of  Assyria  and  Babylon  disap-
peared. God said that Tyre would be reduced to rubble – and it was. But 
He never said that about Egypt. So Egypt exists even today. When God 
says something through His prophets, it happens exactly like that.

478 Through the Bible: God’s Anger and Vengeance
Nahum
These  things  that  we  read  in  the  Old  Testament  assure  us  that  the  
warnings  given  in  the  New  Testament  will  also  be  fulfilled  exactly  as 
written. God has warned us that everyone will have to give an account 
of their lives to Him one day (Romans 14:12). And in that day, everyone 
will  reap  exactly  what  they  sowed  (Galatians  6:7).  Jesus  said,  “Every 
careless  word  that  people  speak,  they  shall  give  an  account  for  it  in  the  
day of judgement” (Matthew 12:36). However, 99% of the believers whom 
I know, do not believe these warnings in Scripture, because I find that 
they are all very careless with their lives and their words. It is because 
judgement does not come immediately, that many are careless about the 
way  they  live  and  speak.  You  may  be  watching  pornography  in  secret,  
speaking rude words, telling lies and backbiting against others and then 
saying to yourself, “Nothing has happened to me”, and therefore continue 
in sin. That was exactly what Assyria also said: “Yes. Nahum is saying all 
this about us. But nothing is happening to us.” But judgement did come 
a little later. The Lord’s warnings about judgement will also be fulfilled 
exactly as He said – one day.
The other thing we see here is this: When God sent Jonah to Nineveh 
earlier,  we  could  ask  why  God  sent  Jonah  to  Nineveh  when  He  knew  
that this nation was going to become evil and be destroyed after another 
hundred years. God dealt with Nineveh in Jonah’s day as it was then. In 
Jonah’s time, God saw many people in that city who had a desire to repent. 
That was why God sent Jonah there. Even today, God does not send His 
servants anywhere, unless He has a purpose for the people there. If you 
go on your own somewhere, then you had better plan your own message. 
But if you waited on the Lord, and God led you somewhere, then even 
if it is a difficult place like Nineveh, you can be absolutely certain that 
there was a purpose with which God sent you there. Jonah was sent with 
a purpose. There were many people in Nineveh who repented and who 
turned from sin in that generation.
But God did not send Nahum to Nineveh, because He saw that the new 
generation there had no interest in repentance. What we can learn from 
the  example  of  Jonah  and  Nahum  is  this,  that  if  you  listen  to  God,  you  
won’t waste your time going to places where God does not want you to go. 
You will then go only where something useful can be accomplished for God. 
That’s why these prophets lived before God’s face and waited for Him to tell 
them what to do. They didn’t rush around like many Christian workers do 
today, preaching here and there. They took time to wait on God.
God’s Determination to Destroy Nineveh
The message of Nahum was a message of God’s anger. In Chapter 1, 
verses  2  and  6,  we  see  seven  words  –  jealous, avenging, wrathful, 
vengeance, indignation, anger, burning, rage.  These  words  express  
God’s  intense  anger  and  blazing  fury  not  just  against  sin,  but  also  

God’s Determination to Destroy Nineveh                                                                                            479

against the people who continue in sin. “The Lord is slow to get angry, 
but  when  He  does  get  angry,  you  can’t  stop  Him”  (1:3).  God  is  long-
suffering and very patient. But finally He will judge. And His anger and 
judgement  are  mainly  directed  against  those  who  exploit  others.  He  
will bring justice to all who have been cheated on earth.
There was a difference between Adam’s sin and Cain’s sin. Adam hurt 
himself, but did not hurt anybody else. So he was not cursed. Only the 
ground  was  cursed  (Genesis  3:17).  But  Cain’s  sin  hurt  another  person  
–  Abel.  So  he  himself  was  cursed  by  God  (Genesis  4:11).  When  you  do  
something that hurts another person in some way it is a serious sin. It 
can  bring  God’s  curse  on  you  like  it  did  on  Cain,  if  you  do  not  repent  
and  confess  your  sin.  For  example,  you  may  have  backbitten  against  
someone and thus spoilt his reputation; or you may have become friendly 
with a girl and stirred up her emotions and then given her up (you may 
not have touched her body, but you have still hurt her). God is jealous, 
wrathful, angry and indignant, and His blazing fury will take vengeance 
and revenge, on everyone who does such things. This judgement may not 
have come in you as yet, because He is still waiting for you to repent. But 
God takes note of the smallest things that we do against others, and He 
will punish us for it all one day. Many preachers have lost the anoint-
ing  of  God  upon  their  lives  because  they  spoke  careless  words  against  
others, without knowing the truth – criticising and spreading unverified 
stories.  Then  God  removes  His  anointing  from  such  preachers.  And  if  
they continue to be careless in their speech, God will one day take away 
their salvation too.
Why  was  God  so  angry  with  Assyria?  It  was  not  because  they  were  
smoking and drinking, or taking harmful drugs. We think taking drugs 
is horrible. It is. But in God’s eyes, it is not as horrible as backbiting 
– because when you take drugs you hurt only yourself, but when you 
backbite, you hurt others.
I want to do what those Old Testament prophets did: Give you a proper 
understanding of what God considers as serious sins. God’s blazing fury 
against Assyria was because they hurt other people. In the same way, one 
day God will judge every single human being that ever lived, if he hurt 
anyone in any way by his words or his actions. People find it difficult 
to believe that. But that is just like people finding it difficult to believe 
in a real place called “Hell”. There are many who imagine that God will 
finally save everybody and that even those who go to hell will finally go to 
heaven!!! Some even go to the extreme of believing that Satan himself will 
get converted one day! But I believe God’s word. If you cannot believe in a 
God full of anger, then you do not believe in a God full of love either. Love 
demands anger and punishment – and I’ll explain why.

480 Through the Bible: God’s Anger and Vengeance
Nahum
Suppose you have two children whom you love equally, and one day 
you see the older boy hitting his younger brother with a stone and making 
him  bleed.  That  poor  younger  boy  is  unable  to  defend  himself  against  
someone stronger than him. What will you do as a father? Will you just 
stand and watch that? You love both your boys. And because you love, 
you  will  be  angry.  If  you  don’t  love  your  child,  you  will  ignore  what  is  
being  done  and  won’t  be  angry.  But  love  will  bring  anger  against  evil,  
for  love  demands  justice.  You  will  punish  the  older  boy  for  hurting  his  
weaker brother. That is exactly what God did with Assyria too. And that 
is what He will one day do to all people who hurt others in any way. We 
will see this clearly in the day of judgement.
So I hope our study of Nahum will make us extremely careful in future 
to avoid words and actions that might hurt others in any way. Do you 
want to be a servant of God? Then be careful with your words – espe-
cially words that you speak about those whom you don’t like, or with 
whom you don’t agree.
In 1:7–10, we see God’s attitude towards His friends and His enemies. 
First  we  see  His  attitude  towards  those  who  respond  to  His  word  in  
repentance.  He  is  good  to  them.  When  trouble  comes  He  is  a  strong  
refuge. If you humble yourselves and respond to these strong warnings 
of the prophets God will be very good to you, and when trouble comes 
He  will  be  like  a  refuge  to  you,  protecting  you  like  that  father  protects  
his little boy from being bullied by others. The Lord knows everyone who 
trusts in Him. He doesn’t forget even one person. You may be weak, poor 
and hopeless, but God knows you personally, if you are one of those who 
trust in Him.
Then in the next few verses we see God’s attitude towards His enemies. 
“He sweeps away His enemies like in an overflowing flood” (1:8). When a 
flood comes, it just wipes out everybody in a moment. That’s how judge-
ment is going to come upon God’s enemies. “He pursues His foes into the 
darkness of the night.” The prophet uses these expressions to show how 
God pursues those who don’t take His word seriously, in order to destroy 
them. “Why are you scheming against the Lord? He will destroy you with 
one blow. He doesn’t need to strike you a second time. When God strikes 
His  enemies  they  will  stagger  like  drunkards  and  be  burnt  up  like  dry  
straw in a field. Who is this king of yours who dares to plot evil against the 
Lord?” (1:9, 10).
What were Assyria’s sins that God was so angry with them? First of all 
their pride towards God, and secondly their cruelty towards others. They 
took advantage of others and exploited them. These are the two things 
that the prophets always emphasised – the people’s attitude towards God, 
and their attitude towards other human beings. It is because most believ-
ers don’t read these prophetic books sufficiently that they too remain

proud  towards  God  and  hard  towards  others.  Many  believers  say  that  
these Old Testament prophetic books are boring. That’s exactly what the 
devil wants you to say, so that you understand nothing of God’s anger 
against pride and hardness of heart.
I want to encourage you to read these prophets, even if you find some 
of it laborious reading. You can get inside the heart of God as you read 
these  words  and  understand  how  God  feels  towards  such  issues.  By  
constant repetition, the message will hit home and finally be written in 
your heart – that God hates sin. Then you will fear and tremble to commit 
any of those sins.
There is a difference between God’s chastening and His anger. Notice 
here – He says to Israel, “O my people, I have punished you enough! Now 
I will break your chains and release you from the yoke of slavery” (1; 12, 
13). But to the Assyrian king, He says, “I will bury you” (1:14).
He  told  the  Assyrians.  “You  are  going  to  be  judged”  (1:14).  Then  the  
Lord  told  Israel,  “Behold,  on  the  mountains  the  feet  of  him  who  brings  
good news, who announces peace.... Never again will the wicked one pass 
through  you;  he  has  been  cut  off  completely”  (1:15).  This  is  a  picture  of  
proclaiming the good news that the devil has been destroyed. This verse 
is similar to Isaiah 52:7 where we read, “How lovely on the mountains are 
the feet of him who brings good news, who announces peace and salvation 
and says to Zion, ‘Your God reigns!’ ” There the emphasis was on the reign 
of God. Here in Nahum it is on the defeat of God’s enemy.
Assyria is a picture of Satan and his kingdom, and the good news we 
have  to  go  proclaiming  to  people  is,  “Don’t  be  afraid,  O  people.  Satan  
has been defeated. His kingdom has been destroyed.” Most people who 
proclaim the gospel only proclaim that people’s sins have been forgiven. 
That’s good. But that’s only a part of the gospel. There are many reasons 
why Jesus died. He died so that we might be forgiven of all our sins. He 
died so that our old man would be crucified so that we might not serve 
sin any longer. He died so that the curse of the law might never be upon 
us.  He  also  died  so  that  Satan  might  be  defeated.  Here  in  Nahum  the  
message  is:  “Your  enemy  has  been  defeated  and  will  never  have  power  
over you again.” Do you preach this good news that Satan and sin can 
never have power over God’s people?
A  few  years  after  Nahum  prophesied,  there  was  no  hope  left  for  the  
people of Assyria (whose capital was Nineveh). This generation was differ-
ent  from  the  one  in  Jonah’s  time.  Here  God  gave  them  no  opportunity  
for repentance, because they had resisted His calls again and again. God 
had waited long enough and the door was now shut. The Assyrians had 
kept on sinning, and they had finally crossed the red line that God draws 
in  front  of  nations  and  people.  The  Bible  says  that  there  is  a  sin  unto  
death and that there is no use praying for people who have crossed that 
red line (1 John 5:16). A person can keep on sinning and keep on reject-
ing God’s calls and harden his heart. Then one day he crosses the red 

482 Through the Bible: God’s Anger and Vengeance
Nahum
line and then he will have no more desire to repent of his sins. Then there 
is no hope for him (See Proverbs 29:1). At that point He sins against the 
Holy Spirit and there is no more forgiveness possible after that. It is very 
dangerous, especially for a believer, to keep on sinning and to keep on 
rejecting God’s pleadings.
Assyria had destroyed the land of Israel and hurt the people there in so 
many ways (2:2). But the Lord would restore Israel’s honour and power 
again. Nahum describes how Assyria would be destroyed and plundered 
of all its treasures (2:9). That prophecy was fulfilled when Babylon came 
some  years  later  and  destroyed  Assyria  and  took  away  their  wealth.  
Nineveh, full of fight and boldness, was once like a mighty lion (2:11, 12). 
They crushed their enemies to feed their cubs. They filled their cities and 
homes with captives and plunder. That was how they exploited others. 
They made themselves rich at the expense of poor people. Today, preach-
ers  make  themselves  rich  at  the  expense  of  poor  people.  Do  you  think  
God’s judgement of these preachers will be any different from His judge-
ment  of  Nineveh?  If  people  want  to  make  money,  they  should  go  into  
business, not into Christian work. That’s not the place to make money. 
Actually, the judgement of those who make themselves rich at the expense 
of poor believers will be worse than the judgement of Nineveh, because 
these preachers have more light than Nineveh had.
“You filled your homes with plunder”  (2:12).  Preacher,  is  your  home  
filled with what you have taken from poor people? If so, the Lord says to 
you “I am your enemy, and you will never again be able to plunder these 
poor people again, because I will judge you” (2:13).
The Reason for Nineveh’s Destruction
God  takes  revenge  on  behalf  of  those  who  cannot  avenge  themselves.  
His judgement came on Nineveh, because she “enticed the nations with 
her  beauty  and  taught  them  to  worship  her  false  gods”  (3:4).  Nineveh  
attracted  the  nations  and  then  destroyed  them.  There  was  something  
very powerful about her earthly attractiveness, as in the attractions in 
Western  lands  today.  The  warning  here  is:  “Beware  of  being  attracted  
to  anything  earthly  if  it  is  not  also  godly,  because  when  God  destroys  
that, you will be destroyed too.” There are lots of things on earth that are 
attractive and the devil will try to tempt you with them. He even tried to 
tempt Jesus with them saying, “I will give you all the glory of this world, 
if You will bow down and worship me.” The attractive things of earth are 
still being offered to all those who will bow down to Satan in some area. 
I have seen many believers do this and suffer the consequences. So take 
heed to this warning.
The  Lord  asks  Nineveh,  “Are  you  better  than  (the  city  of)  No-amon,  
which  was  situated  by  the  waters  of  the  Nile,  with  water  surrounding  
her? Ethiopia was her might, and Egypt too; Put and Lubim were among 

The Reason for Nineveh’s Destruction                                                                                                  483
Nahum
her  helpers.  Yet  she  went  into  captivity”  (3:8–10).  No-amon  was  one  of  
those difficult cities in Egypt that Assyria could not conquer because it 
was  surrounded  by  water  on  every  side,  and  protected  by  their  allies.  
But finally Assyria conquered No-amon too. And now the Lord says to 
Assyria, “The same thing will now happen to you.” 
God  may  at  times  give  us  a  ministry  that  was  originally  given  to  
someone else but taken away from him because of his backsliding – just 
like  David  replaced  King  Saul.  Beware  of  thinking  then  in  pride,  “I  am  
better than him. God has given his ministry to me.” What happened to 
that other person can happen to you too. Paul, the great apostle, said, 
“I  am afraid that after preaching to others, I myself might be disqualified.” 
(1 Corinthians 9:27). Because Paul lived in that fear in humility, he was 
never disqualified.  The  Lord  told  Nineveh  that  she  would  be  punished  
and her troops would become as weak as women. There was no healing 
now for their wound. And people everywhere will agree with God’s judge-
ment on her (3:11–19).
One day all men will stand before God for the final judgement. Why 
would  God  pull  people  out  of  hell,  put  them  back  into  their  bodies,  
and make them stand before Him for a final judgement (Revelation 
20:11, 12)? There is a reason. The whole world must know why these 
people are being sent to hell. In that day, the whole world will agree 
with  God’s  judgement.  No-one  will  ever  have  any  more  doubt  as  to  
whether someone who went to hell deserved to go there. Today many 
people say that so-and-so is a good man and cannot possibly go to hell. 
But on that day when God reveals everyone’s secret life and thoughts, 
every doubt will be removed and the whole world will agree with God’s 
judgement.  Nahum  reminds  us  of  that,  through  his  prophecy  about  
the judgement on Nineveh!



HABAKKUK
The Conflict and Triumph of Faith
I
f Nahum spoke about God’s anger and vengeance, Habakkuk spoke 
about the conflict of faith and the triumph of faith. This is the story 
of a man who had questions but who made the journey from doubt 
to certainty. He starts with doubt, “O Lord, how long must I call for help 
before you will listen? I shout to you in vain; there is no answer. I cry, but 
no one comes to save” (1:2). But he ends with certainty: “I will rejoice in 
the  Lord.  The  Lord  God  is  my  strength;  He  will  bring  me  safely  over  the  
mountains” (3:18, 19).
Habakkuk had two questions that he asked God. And God gave him 
the answers. Even a man of God can have doubts and questions. There is 
nothing wrong with asking God questions. If little children, as they grow 
up,  do  not  ask  their  parents  any  questions,  that  is  a  bad  sign.  A  good  
father will always encourage his children to ask questions. No father is 
ever upset if his little child asks him questions. God is not upset either if 
you ask Him questions. When you have a question don’t go to people of 
your own level of maturity. They will only confuse you – and your ques-
tions  may  confuse  them  too.  They  may  not  have  had  any  doubts  until  
you asked them those questions. And now you have put some doubt into 
their minds! Go to God instead. 
The First Question
The first question Habakkuk had was a question that all of us have: 
Why  do  wicked  people  prosper?  This  was  the  question  that  Asaph  had  
(Psalm  73). Jeremiah lived at the same time as Habakkuk and he also 
had the same question. The Lord replied to Jeremiah saying, “If you can’t 
run with men how will you run with horses?” (Jeremiah 12:5), meaning, 
“If you can’t solve such a simple problem, how will you deal with major 
problems  in  life?”  Asaph  went  into  the  presence  of  God  and  got  an  

486 Through the Bible: The Conflict and Triumph of Faith
Habakkuk
answer (Psalm 73:17). Jeremiah also went into God’s presence and got an 
answer. Habakkuk likewise went into God’s presence and got an answer. 
When  you  have  a  question,  you  can  certainly  ask  a  godly  brother.  But  
Habakkuk went to God, because there weren’t any godly brothers living 
near him at that time. Jeremiah was prophesying at the same time; but 
he was perhaps not living near Habakkuk.
Habakkuk’s cry was, “How long, O Lord, must I call for help? You don’t 
seem  to  listen!  I  am  Your  servant.  Look  at  what  these  ungodly  people  
are doing to me. And You are not doing anything to save me.” (1:2). Have 
you  ever  felt  like  that?  For  2000  years  many  godly  Christians  have  
felt like that. “Lord, why do these godless people prosper? Why do You 
allow them to harass Your people? Wherever I look there is misery and 
destruction and violence, and I am surrounded with people who love to 
argue and fight” (1:3). Habakkuk looked at Judah and said, “The law 
has become paralyzed and useless, and there is no justice given in the 
courts. The wicked far outnumber the righteous, and justice is perverted 
with bribes and trickery” (1:4).
This was written 2600 years ago, but it is so relevant today! If you are 
a Christian witnessing for the Lord, you may find in many parts of the 
world, that this passage is true – that the law has become paralyzed and 
that you get no justice in the courts of your land. 
God’s Answer
The Lord didn’t answer Habakkuk’s question directly. Very often Jesus 
did not answer questions directly either. This is because God’s wisdom is 
far superior to ours. God’s reply to Habakkuk was, “Look at the nations 
and be amazed, for I am going to do something in your day which you won’t 
even believe if someone told you about it, because it has never happened 
like that before for Judah” (1:5).
Israel had gone into captivity, but Judah had never experienced that. 
It was eight centuries earlier that they had all been slaves in Egypt. But 
that  was  now  a  distant  memory.  Now  the  Lord  was  going  to  do  some-
thing with them that they wouldn’t believe. It was not a mighty miracle 
of deliverance that He was going to perform. Some people misquote this 
verse as though it were a promise of some great miracle that God would 
do. But what the Lord was actually saying was that He was going to raise 
up an evil nation to enslave His people. It would be difficult for them to 
believe that their God would ever do such a thing. But God was saying, 
“I am raising up Babylon to be the new super-power in the world. They 
will not rise up by accident. I am in control of the world and I am raising 
them up.”

The First Question                                                                                                                                    487
Habakkuk
Whenever  we  have  had  national  elections  in  India,  we  have  always  
had times of prayer. We felt we were too small in number as believers to 
influence the election-results by voting. But we knew we could influence 
the results by praying, because God controls all people. God is the One 
Who raises up one and puts down another. So we would pray, “Lord, we 
don’t know what is good for India, and for the believers in our land and 
for the spread of the gospel. We want You to put into power those whom 
You  have  sovereignly  permitted,  for  the  fulfilment  of  Your  purposes.” 
Sometimes what we think is good for us may not be the best for us. How 
many  of  us  would  have  selected  the  Babylonians  to  rule  over  Judah?  
Nobody.  That’s  why  God  had  to  say,  “I  am  going  to  do  something  that  
you won’t believe. Your ways are not My ways.” When we don’t under-
stand God’s ways, we cannot believe that God would make a nation like 
Babylon a super-power.
The idea that many Christians have of God is that of a “Grandfather” 
who sits in heaven always giving us gifts that will make us happy. That 
is a totally wrong concept of God. Most Christians don’t have a proper 
understanding of God’s holiness. That is why they cannot believe that 
God would use non-Christians to discipline His children. For example, 
if in a country where elections are to be held, the Christians are fight-
ing with each other, and criticising each other, with each denomination 
imagining that they alone are God’s chosen people, what sort of politi-
cal party would God allow to win the elections? The Christians may all 
pray, “Lord, give us a government that gives us freedom to preach the 
gospel and allows us to receive money from America freely.” But God 
may see that American money is hindering the testimony of His child-
ren in that land and may allow a party to win the elections that stops 
all foreign money and persecutes Christians. Then the Christians who 
were criticising each other will stop doing that. They will become a little 
more united with each other. And the Christians who are dependent on 
foreign money will realise that there is enough money in their country 
itself to do the Lord’s work. As a result, all the Christians will become 
stronger Christians and the church will be more united. God’s way is 
always the best.
So here the Lord says, “I am raising the Babylonians up.” It was God 
Who  raised  them  up.  The  Lord  told  Pharaoh,  the  greatest  ruler  of  his  
time,  “I  have  raised  you  up  to  demonstrate  My  power  in  you”  (Romans 
9:17). When Pharaoh rebelled against God, God crushed him and thus 
manifested His mighty power. At the same time God raised up Moses in 
the same generation to manifest His power in Him in quite another way. 
If you cooperate with God, He will use you to manifest His power through 
you like with Moses. If you don’t cooperate with God, He will still use you 
as a warning to all generations as to what happens to a man who defies 

488 Through the Bible: The Conflict and Triumph of Faith
Habakkuk
God. So it is best to humble ourselves before God, so that He can make 
us a good example rather than a bad one. Even if you are a believer but 
proud, God will resist you and make you a warning to other believers. 
The Babylonians were “a cruel and violent nation, notorious for cruelty 
and more fierce than wolves” (verses 6–9). They advanced like the wind 
scorning the defences of many nations. Yet they were deeply guilty before 
God, because “they had made their strength their god” (verse 11).
Was  this  the  answer  to  Habakkuk’s  question  as  to  why  the  wicked  
prospered?
Habakkuk said to the Lord, “You haven’t answered my question. You 
have just said that the wicked are going to prosper.” But God did answer 
his question. He said, “I am fully in control, and I am accomplishing My 
purpose through Babylon, even if you can’t see it fully.” 
Today, 2600 years later, we can look back and see that Babylon was 
raised up by God and then destroyed by God. And we can say, “Lord, it 
is wonderful what You did.” 
Notice the result of Judah being taken to Babylon for 70 years. From 
the time of the judges (1300 B.C.) to the time of the Babylonian captiv-
ity  (600  B.C.),  Israel  worshipped  idols  frequently.  Even  during  David’s  
time  many  were  worshipping  the  bronze  serpent  (2  Kings  18:4).  Idol  
worship was going on continuously in Israel for almost 700 years. Then 
God sent them to Babylon for 70 years. When the Jews returned, they 
never again worshipped idols (for the last 2500 years). God solved that 
problem  permanently  through  the  captivity.  Isn’t  that  amazing?  The  
Jews may have committed many other sins, but they never went back to 
idolatry again.
God can sometimes teach one final lesson like that to a person and 
change him forever. He broke Jacob with a once-and-for-all breaking at 
Peniel – and Jacob was a different man ever after. Sometimes God has 
to  use  strong-arm  methods  to  teach  us  a  permanent  lesson.  We  may  
not  always  understand  why  God  allows  certain  things  in  our  lives.  It  
is  enough  to  know  that  God  is  in  control  of  all  the  circumstances  of  
our lives. The people whom God uses to accomplish His purposes may 
however be evil people like the Babylonians.
God has used people who hate Christians to fulfil His purposes – in 
ancient Rome and in modern Communist countries. In our lifetime, we 
have  seen  how  Christians  have  been  persecuted  in  many  Com  munist  
lands.  How  many  Christians  would  ever  pray  that  such  Com  mu-
nist    governments  should  remain  in  power?  Yet  God  allowed  those   
Com munists to come to power for a time and then put them down. But 
what happened during the time they were in power? Some of the finest 
Christians  in  the  world  came  forth  from  those  countries  –  far  better  
Christians   than   the   money-loving,   comfort-loving   Christians   living   
in  countries  without  persecution.  Through  the  fires  of  persecution, 
Christians got purified. That was why God permitted the Communists to 

The Second Question                                                                                                                               489
Habakkuk
come to power for a while. We don’t always know what to pray for. But 
our Heavenly Father knows what is good for His children at all times and 
in every land – and He is “the Blessed Controller of all things” that happen 
on this earth (1 Timothy 6:15 - J.B. Phillips). Hallelujah!!
The Second Question
Then  Habakkuk  questions  the  Lord  like  a  lawyer  in  court:  “O  Lord  my  
God, Who are eternal, is Your plan to wipe us out? Surely not! O God, You 
have decreed the rise of these Chaldeans (Babylon) to chasten and correct 
us  for  our  awful  sins.  We  are  wicked,  but  they  far  more!  Will  You,  Who  
cannot  allow  sin  in  any  form,  stand  idly  by  while  they  swallow  us  up?  
Should You be silent while the wicked destroy those who are better than 
they? Are we but fish, to be caught and killed? Are we but creeping things 
that have no leader to defend them from their foes? Must we be strung up 
on their hooks and dragged out in their nets, while they rejoice? Then they 
will worship their nets! ‘These are the gods who make us rich,’ they’ll say. 
Will you let them get away with this forever?” (1:12–17).
He tells the Lord that the Babylonians will worship their own abilities, 
if they succeed in capturing Judah.
God’s Answer
He decided to climb into his watchtower and wait and see what the Lord 
would reply to his complaint (2:1). The Lord’s reply was: “Write My answer 
in large clear letters on a tablet, so that everyone can see it and tell every-
body else: The things I plan will not happen right away. Slowly, steadily, 
surely the time approaches when the vision will be fulfilled. And if it seems 
slow,  be  patient,  wait  patiently.  It  will  surely  take  place.  It  will  not  be  
delayed. I will judge them finally, and I will make My people prosper. But 
it won’t happen overnight” (2:2, 3).
The Lord urged Habakkuk to be patient. God was not in a hurry to judge 
evil. We want God to work on our behalf immediately. Prayer for us is like 
pressing a button and we want an instant miracle – just like we make 
instant coffee!! We seek for instant salvation, instant baptism in the Holy 
Spirit, instant miracles. But God says we have to be patient. Character 
cannot be formed in an instant. It takes a long period of time, suffering, 
and  trials  for  character  to  be  formed. “Tribulation  works  patience  and  
patience produces character” (Romans 5:3, 4).
So the first thing God told Habakkuk was to be patient.
The second thing He told him was to live by faith (2:4). Patience and 
faith go together (Hebrews 6:12, 15). These are the two qualities we need 
in times of trial.
This verse (“The righteous shall live by faith.”) is quoted thrice in the 
New  Testament  –  in  Romans  1:17; Galatians  3:11;  and  Hebrews  10:38  

490 Through the Bible: The Conflict and Triumph of Faith
Habakkuk
–  and  was  the  great  watchword  of  the  Reformation,  as  the  reformers  
proclaimed, “Justification by faith”.
In the context here however, the verse is referring to the Babylonians 
coming to Judah. What Judah needed in this situation was faith in God. 
God  was  saying,  “Look  at  those  proud  Babylonians.  They  trust  in  them-
selves. They are crooked. But the righteous one will live by faith.”
What  is  the  faith  that  we  all  need  to  have?  Just  this:  Knowing  that  
God  controls  everything  and  everyone  on  earth,  and  that  He  loves  us  
immensely and will deal with our enemies at the right time. 
“Look at the proud! They trust in themselves, and their lives are crooked; 
but the righteous will live by their faith” (2:4). According to this verse, 
there are only two categories of people in the world – the proud who are 
crooked and the righteous who live by faith. 
So the opposite of faith is not just unbelief, but pride as well. A man of 
faith will always be humble. Genuine Biblical faith and genuine humility 
always go together. So the best way to find out if today’s preachers who 
talk  so  much  about  “faith”  have  genuine  Biblical  faith  is  by  checking  
whether they are clothed with humility! If not, then their so-called “faith” 
is not the Biblical type.
We also see in this verse that a proud person is crooked. Crookedness 
always goes with pride. Whenever you see a proud person, you can be 
certain that there is some hidden crookedness in his life. An upright man 
will always be humble. God resists the proud but gives grace only to the 
humble (James 4:6).
The  next  thing  we  see  here  is  the  treacherous  nature  of  wealth  (2:5). 
Wealth  of  any  sort  –  whether  it  be  wealth  of  money  or  intelligence  or  
anything earthly – is treacherous in that it can make its owner proud. 
One  other  characteristic  of  such  people  is  that  they  are  never  content.  
“They are never satisfied. They are greedy – always wanting more” (2:5). 
One day justice will catch up with such people (2:6).
Chapter 2:6–19 is a description of how a self-centred life finally destroys 
itself. A proud person is centred in himself. He does not live by faith, but 
has total confidence in himself. The Lord says, “How  terrible  it  will  be  
for  you  who  get  rich  by  unjust  means!  You  believe  your  wealth  will  buy  
security, putting your families beyond the reach of danger” (2:9). A person 
whose security is in his wealth will ultimately destroy himself. But in the 
midst of such arrogant people the man of faith believes that, “the whole 
earth will (one day) be filled with the glory of the Lord as the waters fill the 
sea” (2:14). He looks forward to that day and has patience to wait for it.
When Habakkuk saw the Lord, his heart was full of praise: “The Lord 
is in His holy temple, let all the earth be silent” (2:20). The conflict of his 
faith  ended  in  the  triumph  of  faith.  He  says,  “Lord,  I  am  silent  before  
Your majesty. I have no more questions.” When Job saw the glory of God 

Habakkuk’s Praise                                                                                                                                     491
Habakkuk
he  also  said,  “Now  I  see  You.  I  put  my  hand  over  my  mouth”  (Job  42:5; 
40:4, 5). Job had no more questions once he saw the Lord. God will not 
answer all your 10,000 questions because if He did, you will then have 
10,000  more  questions!  The  answer  (as  in  Job’s  case  and  Habakkuk’s  
case) is to see the Lord Himself. The Lord is in His holy temple. Have you 
seen Him? Then your flesh will be silent before Him and you will have no 
more questions!
Habakkuk’s Praise
When Habakkuk saw God, he saw the reward of living a life of faith. A life 
that  is  God-centred  is  a  triumphant  one.  Habakkuk  who  had  thought  
that  God  was  doing  nothing  to  punish  evil  people  now  prays  that  God  
will be merciful in the midst of His anger (3:2). He who had imagined that 
God had forsaken His people now sings a song of praise. He says, “I am 
filled with amazement at the things you have done. When I see God the 
Holy One, His brilliant splendour fills the heavens. The earth is full of His 
praise. What a wonderful God He is. He rejoices in His awesome power. 
When He looks, the nations tremble. You went out to rescue your chosen 
people, to save your anointed ones. You crushed the head of the house 
of the wicked” (3:2–13).
Habakkuk now saw God first and not the Babylonians. The pure in 
heart will see God everywhere and all the time (Matthew 5:8). The trouble 
till now was that Habakkuk saw only the wicked Babylonians prosper-
ing. Now He saw that God was in control of everything. 
The “head of the house of the wicked” could be applied to Satan, who 
was crushed by Jesus on the cross.
All of Habakkuk’s questions were answered when he saw God in His 
glory and in His greatness. He trembled inwardly when he saw God and 
said, “I will wait quietly for the coming day when disaster will strike the 
people who invade us” (2:16). When you have a doubt, talk to God about 
it and not to man. God’s final word to Habakkuk and to us is “Wait!” 
When Habakkuk waited and listened to God, his complaint was turned 
into a song. The same will be true of us. The hardest work of all is to wait.
Habakkuk’s  wonderful  song  of  praise  is  one  of  the  most  beautiful  
songs of faith in the entire Old Testament. He sings here like a new-cov-
enant saint: “Even though the fig trees have no blossoms, and there are 
no grapes on the vine; even though the olive crop fails, and the fields lie 
empty and barren; even though the flocks die in the fields, and the cattle 
barns are empty – yet I will rejoice in the LORD! I will be joyful in the God 
of my salvation” (3:17, 18).
Like Job, his business may be ruined and he may have lost everything. 
But he will still rejoice because his joy is found in the Lord and not in 
anything on earth. Even if everything around us fails, we will still rejoice 
in the God of our salvation.

492 Through the Bible: The Conflict and Triumph of Faith
Habakkuk
A  song  of  praise  is  the  outward  expression  of  the  inner  triumph  of  
faith. “They believed His words – and sang His praise” (Psalm 106:12).
Habakkuk goes on to say, “The Sovereign Lord is my strength! He will 
make me as surefooted as a deer and bring me safely over the mountains” 
(3:19). This prophet who had so many doubts and fears at the beginning 
now says that the Lord will take him safely over every mountain of doubt 
and make him as sure-footed on those mountains as the deer that don’t 
lose their footing on the rocky crags. 
Habakkuk  adds  an  interesting  little  note  at  the  end:  “(For  the  choir  
director:  This  prayer  must  be  accompanied  by  stringed  instruments)” 
(3:19). What he is saying is that even though everything is lost, don’t sing 
this song as a mournful dirge! It must be set to joyful music – and make 
sure that many musical instruments are used as well!
We  must  learn  to  praise  the  Lord  with  all  of  our  hearts.  Never  sing  
hymns  in  a  drab,  monotonous  way.  The  Lord  is  on  the  throne  and  
Jesus is Victor, no matter what happens in this universe. Let us there-
fore use our voices and all the musical instruments God has given us, 
to praise Him and exalt His Name. Amen.

ZEPHANIAH
The Severity and Goodness of God
Z
ephaniah  prophesied  soon  after  Nahum,  before  the  Babylonians  
became the great world power and just before Jeremiah’s time. It is 
possible that Jeremiah was there towards the end of Zephaniah’s 
time of prophecy. Zephaniah also spoke about the destruction of Assyria 
and  the  rise  of  Babylon.  But  His  main  theme  was  the  severity  and  the  
goodness  of  God. Romans  11:22  tells  us  to  look  carefully  at  the  good-
ness and the severity of God. We can see that verse emphasised in the 
whole book of Zephaniah. First of all, he declares the severity of God in 
His strictness against sin. Then he declares the goodness of God to the 
remnant of His people.
As we study these “minor” prophets we notice certain themes recur-
ring  in  many  of  them  –  the  anger  of  God  against  sin,  the  certainty  of  
judgement,  the  evils  of  pride  and  of  exploitation  of  the  poor,  the  love  
of  money  and  the  immorality  found  among  the  leaders,  God  using  the  
heathen  to  chasten  His  people,  the  need  for  faith  and  patience  if  God  
does  not  answer  immediately,  not  being  deceived  by  external  manifes-
tations of revival, and promises to the remnant. All the prophets spoke 
about a remnant among God’s people. They spoke about how, in a time 
of spiritual decline among God’s people, there would be a few who would 
remain faithful to God.
The  things  written  in  the  Old  Testament  have  been  written  for  our  
instruction  (1  Corinthians  10:11).  There  is  a  decline  among  Christians  
today just like there was a decline in Israel in the past. The two kingdoms – 
Israel and Judah – are a picture of the two groups in Christendom. Israel, 
with 10 tribes, symbolises the larger group of mainline denominations. 
And Judah with 2 tribes, symbolises the smaller non-conformist assem-
blies. But both these groups are in decline today. In the Old Testament, 
Judah did not learn from Israel’s mistakes. And the non-conformist groups 
today  have  not  learnt  from  the  mistakes  the  mainline  denominations  

494 Through the Bible: The Severity and Goodness of God
Zephaniah
have  made  –  and  they  have  made  the  same  mistakes  themselves.  But  
ultimately, from both groups, God has chosen a remnant today.
There is spiritual decline today – both among the ritualistic groups and 
among the independent groups. But in the midst of all this, God has a 
few who have a heart for Him. They are not all found in one denomina-
tion. They are found in all the denominations – men and women who love 
God and are seeking to honour Him in all things. They are genuinely filled 
with  the  Holy  Spirit  and  do  not  get  involved  in  controversies.  They  are  
very careful in the use of their tongues and are very faithful with money. 
God is gathering such people together in these days as His remnant.
The  theme  of  the  prophets  was  always  restoration.  The  remnant  
prepared the way for the coming of the Lord Jesus. When the Lord was 
born, there was a small remnant – Simeon and Anna in the temple, John 
the Baptist, the shepherds, and a few wise men from the east. Today also 
there  is  a  remnant  in  Christendom  who  are  preparing  the  way  for  the  
coming of the Lord.
Zephaniah first speaks about the coming day of judgement. He speaks 
more about “the day of the Lord” than any other prophet. There was a revival 
in  Judah  in  King  Josiah’s  time,  about  4  years  before  Nebuchadnezzar  
came and took them away as captives. But it was a superficial revival. 
The prophets like Zephaniah and Jeremiah saw through that and were 
not deceived. But most people in Israel were deceived. Many Christians 
today are also being deceived by so-called “revivals”, and are unable to 
see through their hollowness and superficiality.
Much  of  what  is  called  “revival”  today  in  Christendom  is  merely  
emotional excitement and psychological gimmicks imposed on a gulli-
ble public by clever, money-loving preachers. There is no revival there 
to  holiness,  or  to  humility,  or  to  freedom  from  the  love  of  money,  or  
to poverty of spirit etc. Any revival that does not lead God’s people to 
obey the teachings in the sermon on the mount (Matthew 5 to 7), is a 
counterfeit. Don’t be deceived by what is called “revival” today. Most of 
it is not revival at all.
Prophets like Jeremiah and Zephaniah could see through such superfi-
cial “revivals” in their day immediately. Read their prophecies and see how 
they exposed the superficiality of the “revivals” in their time. The people of 
Judah, however, felt that these prophets were “being negative”. But those 
prophets  were  not  being  negative.  They  were  only  speaking  the  truth. 
Four  years  later,  when  Nebuchadnezzar  came  and  took  Judah  captive,  
the  people  realised  that  Jeremiah  and  Zephaniah  were  right.  The  true  
prophets of God can see through the hollowness and emptiness of what 
everybody else called “revival”. One day, God will make it evident to all that 
His servants who exposed these superficial “revivals”  were  right.  Those  
who are criticised as “heretics” are often the true prophets of the Lord.

Judgement in the Day of the Lord                                                                                                         495
Zephaniah
Judgement in the Day of the Lord
Zephaniah  prophesied  judgement  on  the  earth,  on  Judah  and  on  the  
nations  around  Judah  –  Gaza,  Moab,  Ammon,  Ethiopia  and  Assyria  
(Chapters 1 and 2).
There is a double fulfilment of these Old Testament prophecies. The 
initial reference was to the coming of the Assyrians, the Babylonians and 
Nebuchadnezzar against Israel and Judah. The future reference is to the 
coming of the Antichrist against the church. There was a remnant then 
and there is a remnant now. The day of the Lord spoken of then was the 
day of God’s judgement through the Babylonians. For us, the day of the 
Lord is the second coming of Christ.
The Lord said, “Not only the other nations, but I will crush Judah and 
Jerusalem too with My fist and destroy every last trace of their Baal 
worship, because they go up to the roof and bow down to the sun, moon 
and stars. They claim to follow the Lord, but worship Molech” (1:4, 5). 
The Canaanites had succeeded in dragging Israel down to their level. 
Israel  went  to  Canaan  to  manifest  the  true  God  to  them,  but  they  
dragged Israel down to their level.
If you stand on a table and try to pull a person who is standing on the 
ground to the table-top, while he tries to pull you down, it will be easier 
for him to pull you down. This was what happened to Judah. The Lord 
warned Judah not to have any dealings with the Canaanites; but they did 
not listen. What was the result? Judah could not make the Canaanites 
worship Jehovah. But the Canaanites pulled Judah down to their level – 
and Judah started worshipping Baal, the sun, the moon and the stars.
This  is  what  happens  when  a  Christian  church  tries  to  “Indianise” 
their  worship.  They  end  up  very  often  with  idolatrous  non-Christian  
practices. I saw a book written by a “Christian” priest that had a picture 
on its cover of Jesus sitting under a seven-hooded snake – the snake was 
supposed to symbolise the seven fold Holy Spirit!! That is the result of 
“Indianisation”. In other churches, it may be worldliness that is dragging 
Christians down.
The same thing happens when a believer marries an unbeliever. The 
unbeliever drags the believer down to his/her level. Asking for a dowry 
at the time of marriage is another heathen custom that most Christians 
practice. God  hates  the  dowry  system  because  it  treats  women  as  
commodities to be sold. The prophets stood against such things and the 
religious leaders of Israel hated them for it. It is the same today. And so 
there is hardly a church in India today that takes a bold stand against 
dowry. Christians have been dragged down to the level of the world! They 
take the name of Jesus, but live like the rest of the world around them! 
“On  that  day  I  will  punish  the  leaders  and  all  those  following  pagan  
customs and those who fill their homes with loot.”  (1:8,  9).  The  leaders  

496 Through the Bible: The Severity and Goodness of God
Zephaniah
were the ones who followed the pagan customs and loved money and filled 
their houses with it. The Old Testament prophets always spoke against 
the leaders of God’s people and their love of money – because they were 
the  ones  who  were  primarily  at  fault.  And  so,  those  leaders  called  the  
prophets “heretics” and persecuted them. If God sends a prophet to the 
church today, he too will speak against the pastors and the bishops and 
their compromises and their love of money. And the pastors will call such 
a prophet a “heretic”, close their pulpits to him and persecute him. Every 
single prophet in the Old Testament was persecuted. Not one escaped. 
Stephen  asked  the  Jewish  leaders,  “Name  one  prophet  your  ancestors  
didn’t persecute!” (Acts 7:52). They could not name one. Why were all the 
prophets persecuted? Because they exposed the sins of the leaders.
When Jesus preached, do we see Him preaching against drunkards and 
adulteresses and murderers or even against the cheating tax collectors 
of His day? No. He never said a word against them. He said, “I came to 
seek and to save those sinners.” But He lashed out mercilessly at the reli-
gious leaders who held their Bibles, preached in the meeting-halls, loved 
money,  and  lived  hypocritical  lives.  So  they  killed  Him.  Do  you  follow  
this real Jesus and the true prophets or do you follow the false prophets 
and “another Jesus” who are friendly with worldly Christian leaders, and 
feast with them? Judgement is coming upon the leaders first.
The  Lord  said,  “I  will  search  with  lanterns  in  Jerusalem’s  darkest  
corners to find and punish those who are content in their sins, indifferent 
to the Lord, thinking He will do nothing” (1:12). In the church today also 
there are leaders living in luxury, who have become rich through their 
preaching  and  are  indifferent  to  the  Lord’s  commands.  They  love  their  
titles and positions as “Director”, “Chief Pastor”, “Bishop” etc. The Lord 
is going to expose all of them.
Whenever a church declines spiritually, it always moves towards a life 
of  luxury,  ease,  comfort,  indifference  to  people’s  needs  and  prayerless-
ness. Many young people started serving the Lord with zeal, sacrifice, 
prayer  and  serious  study  of  God’s  Word.  But  30  years  later,  they  have  
cooled off, “choked by the deceitfulness of riches”. If you are not faithful 
to fight against the desires of the flesh and to stand against the corrup-
tion  in  Christendom,  you  will  become  like  the  corrupt  leaders  around  
you. You will be a professional preacher dishing out sermons on Sunday 
mornings, accumulating more and more money, living in luxury and with 
no  anointing  upon  you  –  even  though  you  may  have  started  out  with  
great sincerity. This happened in the time of Zephaniah and it is happen-
ing today.
The Lord describes those who sin like “blind men searching for a path” 
(1:17). And when the leaders themselves are blind, all their followers can 
only expect to fall into a ditch.

Judgement in the Day of the Lord                                                                                                         497
Zephaniah
Then  Zephaniah  says,  “Beg  the  Lord  to  save  you.  All  of  you  who  are  
humble,  seek  for  more  humility”  (2:3).  What  a  word  –  “Seek  for  more 
humility”. Zephaniah understood that God blesses the humble. On one 
side was the pride of Babylon and on the other the humility of the remnant 
in Jerusalem.
As we have seen, from the time of Cain and Abel, there have been two 
streams  in  humanity  –  Babylon  and  Jerusalem.  Babylon  is  a  corrupt,  
religious  system.  Jerusalem  is  the  true  church  of  God.  This  church  is  
characterised not by miracles, signs and wonders, but by humility. They 
are never tired of seeking for more and more humility. 
What then is the danger that faces those who belong to the remnant? 
It is the danger of comparing themselves with other churches and glory-
ing in being superior. That is exactly how the devil wants you to think, 
because  he  knows  that  the  moment  you  start  thinking  like  that,  God  
will become your enemy, and then you will also become like those whom 
you despise. You see how quickly the remnant can themselves become a 
part of Babylon. So pursue humility. Keep your face in the dust always. 
Never compare yourselves with the other people. Compare yourself only 
with Jesus. That is my advice to all who belong to the remnant of God’s 
people today.
Zephaniah  prophesied  that  the  Philistine  cities  would  be  rooted  out  
and made desolate, but a few survivors (again, a remnant) would be cared 
for (2:4, 7). This remnant would be taunted and made fun of by others 
(2:8).  If  you  stand  up  for  the  Lord,  like  Daniel  and  his  three  friends,  
and like the remnant spoken of by the prophets, you can be sure that 
many compromising Christians will taunt you. They will tell you, “What 
a fantastic ministry you could have had, if you had not joined this little 
group  of  fanatics.”  Many  Christians  told  me  that  when  I  gave  up  my  
wider ministry and started meeting with just a few people as a church 
in our home (in 1975). I am thankful that I didn’t listen to any of them. 
I  said to the Lord, “Lord, I don’t care whether I am with only two or three. 
I want to be where You are and I want to proclaim the whole truth of Your 
Word. I don’t care for the opinions of backslidden Christianity and their 
leaders.” If you take a stand like that, you will face a lot of opposition. 
But you will finish your course with joy, if you endure until the end. Keep 
your eyes on the Lord. The Lord says, “Don’t worry about your critics. I’ll 
deal with them in My own time.” Today, my critics are silent. They marvel 
at  what  God  has  done  in  our  midst.  If  however  you  can’t  stand  being  
taunted, you will give up the battle and join the compromisers.
Then Zephaniah spoke about the destruction of Assyria (2:13). Assyria 
had started declining after Nahum had prophesied, but she had not been 
destroyed fully. This prophecy was literally fulfilled: “The Lord will destroy 
Assyria  and  make  its  great  capital,  Nineveh,  parched  like  a  desert.  All  
sorts of wild animals will settle there. Owls of many kinds will live among 
the ruins of its palaces, hooting from the gaping windows” (2:13, 14).

498 Through the Bible: The Severity and Goodness of God
Zephaniah
Then Zephaniah exposes the sin of Judah’s leaders once again, “Their 
leaders  are  like  roaring  lions  hunting  for  everything  they  can  get.  Their  
judges are like ravenous wolves. Their prophets are liars seeking their own 
gain. Their priests disobey God’s laws.” (3:3, 4). Every true prophet always 
spoke against the leaders, princes, judges, prophets and priests. That is 
one way by which we can recognise a true prophet even today.
Even  today,  corrupt  pastors  and  preachers  are  always  seeking  “for 
everything they can get.” Jesus on the other hand taught that it was 
more blessed to give than to receive. The Apostle Paul told the elders of 
the Ephesian church, “For three years, I have demonstrated to you the 
truth of what Jesus taught that it is more blessed to give than to receive” 
(Acts 20:31–35).
Do you think today’s Christian leaders and pastors are demonstrating 
the truth of that verse? No. They are all eager to get. They are like the 
ravenous  wolves  that  Zephaniah  spoke  of,  who  want  to  eat  the  sheep.  
How then can they be representatives of the real Jesus who taught that 
it was more blessed to give than to receive?
What do all these leaders seek? Their own profit – money, money and 
more money from their flock. People ask me, “Brother Zac, why do you 
speak so much against the leaders’ love of money?” I say, “Because the 
Bible speaks so much about it. Because the prophets spoke about it. 
Because Jesus spoke about it. That’s why I also speak about this.”
The Lord has permitted those who preach the gospel to live from the 
gospel – but not that they should become wealthy through preaching the 
gospel! When they expect God’s people to give them gifts and love money, 
and long to become rich, then they have become evil. The Lord watches 
everyone.  One  day  He  will  come  down  in  judgement  on  every  corrupt  
leader. He says to His people, “Be patient; the time is coming soon when 
I will pour out my fiercest anger and fury on them” (3:8).
Salvation in the Day of the Lord
Notice some characteristics of this remnant.
“I  will  purify  the  lips  of  the  people”  (3:9).  The  speech  of  the  remnant  
will be pure. Isaiah was convicted of his speech when he saw the glory 
of  the  Lord.  I  speak  often  about  our  speech  and  about  our  attitude  to  
money  –  because  the  prophets  spoke  much  about  these  two  subjects.  
If   we are careful with our mouth and our money, we can become the Lord’s 
spokesmen.
“All  of  them  will  call  on  the  name  of  the  Lord  and  serve  Him  shoulder  
to shoulder” (3:9). The remnant will be united as one body and serve the 
Lord bearing His burdens – shoulder to shoulder.

Salvation in the Day of the Lord                                                                                                             499
Zephaniah
“I will remove all the proud and arrogant people from among you. There 
will be no pride on my holy mountain. Those who are left will be the lowly 
and  the  humble”  (3:11,  12).  The  remnant  will  comprise  only  of  humble  
people, because the Lord would have removed all the proud ones. That 
is  another  question  people  ask  me,  “Brother  Zac  why  do  you  speak  so  
much about humility?” Because that is what the Bible speaks of, from 
cover to cover.
“Those who are left will trust in the name of the Lord” (3:12). The remnant 
will be a people of faith.
“The people will do no wrong to each other, never telling lies or deceiving 
one  another.  They  will  live  peaceful  lives”  (3:13).  The  remnant  will  be  a  
peaceful people who never tell lies or deceive anyone or harm anyone.
“Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout aloud! Be glad and rejoice with all your 
heart! For the LORD Himself will live among you! (3:14, 15). The remnant 
will be a happy people who have found their perfect security in the Lord’s 
love for them.
“The LORD your God is in your midst, A victorious warrior. He will exult 
over you with joy. He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy” (3:17). God 
rejoices over this remnant. He does not find joy over people who live in 
sin. Can a father rejoice in a child who has cancer, leprosy and tuber-
culosis? No. Neither can God find joy in people who live in sin and who 
don’t want to be healed. But God does find joy in this holy remnant. With 
great gladness He shouts over them and sings a song over them. This is 
the one place in Scripture where it says that God sings over His people. 
There are many places where we are exhorted to sing a song of praise to 
God. But here it is God Who is singing a song over us. What a challenge 
it is to be the type of person whom God can rejoice over.
“He is silently planning for you in love” (3:17 – Paraphrase). The Lord 
plans for us in love and He has pleasant surprises planned for us in 
the days to come, because He is our loving Father.
“I  will  save  the  weak  and  helpless  ones.  I  will  give  glory  and  renown  
to those who were mocked and shamed. I will give you a name of distinc-
tion. They will praise you as I restore your fortunes before their very eyes” 
(3:19, 20). The remnant consists of a people who are weak and helpless 
in themselves. The Lord Himself deals with their enemies and gives His 
people glory and distinction in the final day.
The book of Zephaniah ends on that triumphant note.



HAGGAI
Encouragement to do  
the Lord’s Work
H
aggai wrote very little - just two chapters. But he had a tremendous 
burden  that  the  temple  should  be  built.  For  more  than  15  years  
after the Jews returned from Babylon to Jerusalem, the temple of 
the Lord had not been rebuilt, because the Jews were afraid of opposi-
tion from the people who lived around them. So God sent two prophets to 
them – Haggai (an older man) and Zechariah (a young man) – to encour-
age the Jews to start rebuilding the temple. 
There are four messages in the book of Haggai - one in the first chapter 
and three in the second chapter. 
First Message – Complete the Temple (1:1–15)
The first message was a call to rebuild the temple.
We see here the self-centredness of God’s people. They kept on saying, 
“The time has not yet come to rebuild the Lord’s house” (1:2). The Persian 
king  had  only  ordered  that  the  city  of  Jerusalem  was  not  to  be  rebuilt  
(Ezra 4:21). He never forbade the building of the temple. But the Jews in 
Jerusalem used his words to justify their selfishness and laziness and 
said, “The circumstances are not right as yet to build the temple. So we 
must wait.”
The Lord rebuked them saying, “You feel the time is right to build your 
own luxurious houses, while My house remains in ruins” (1:4). Solomon 
too was selfish. He spent 13 years building his own palace, but he did 
spend at least 7 years in building the temple – and he built the temple 
first. But these Jews built only their own grand houses and were not 
concerned about the Lord’s house at all.

502 Through the Bible: Encouragement to do the Lord’s Work 
Haggai
There  are  millions  of  Christians  like  that  today  who  seek  their  own  
interests  and  their  family’s  interests  first  –  and  not  the  Lord’s.  They 
would be gravely concerned if their own property was encroached upon 
by a neighbour, but they are not one bit concerned when the Lord’s prop-
erty is encroached upon by Satan.
Jesus told us that if we sought the kingdom of God and His righteous-
ness first, everything necessary for our life on earth would be added to 
us. We won’t have to go seeking for them. If we take care of God’s family, 
He will take care of ours. We must be living demonstrations to an unbe-
lieving world that because we honoured God, He has honoured us; that 
because we took care of God’s family, He took care of ours. Is your life 
such a testimony.
We can apply the questions in 1:5, 6 to ourselves like this: The Lord 
challenges us saying, “Consider how things have been going in your life. 
Has there been spiritual fruitfulness? You have planted much, but have 
harvested little. You have gone to many meetings, read many Christian 
books and listened to many Christian tapes. But is your home a godly 
home  and  a  home  of  peace  today?  Have  you  overcome  even  a  simple  
thing  like  shouting  at  your  wife/husband?  If  not,  then  although  you  
have sown much, you have harvested little. You wear clothing, but you 
are still not warm. You earn so much money. But there are holes in your 
pocket and so most of it is wasted. You ask God to fill you with the Spirit. 
But you leak, and so all the power goes out. Something is wrong.”
Who will pour water into a vessel that has holes in it? Many believers 
who come to God asking to be filled with the Holy Spirit, are vessels full 
of holes. God says, “Close up the holes first.” God is eager to fill you with 
His Holy Spirit. But there are things in your life that need to be set right 
first. You won’t put money into a pocket that has holes in it. Neither will 
God fill with His Spirit those who have leaky areas in their life. They have 
not apologised to somebody they wronged, they have not returned money 
they took wrongfully, etc. These are major holes. With such gaping holes 
in your life, it is no use praying all night to be filled with the Holy Spirit. 
Nothing will happen. Instead spend all night fixing those holes. Then the 
answer  will  come  quickly.  One  of  Haggai’s  major  themes  is:  “Consider 
your ways”.
In 1:7, 8, Haggai urges them to complete the building. The foundation 
had been laid many years earlier. But they stopped there. Jesus spoke 
a  parable  about  a  man  who  laid  only  a  foundation  and  then  did  not  
complete the building (Luke 14:28–30). That parable comes right in the 
middle of a section on being His disciple. What Jesus was implying was 
that  evangelism  without  disciple-making  was  like  laying  a  foundation  
and not completing the building. Is a foundation necessary? Yes, abso-
lutely essential. That is the first work to be done when building a house. 

First Message – Complete the Temple (1:1–15)                                                                                  503
Haggai
Is evangelism necessary? Certainly. That too is the first work to be done. 
But if you only evangelise and don’t make disciples, that is wasted effort 
– as useless as a foundation without a building. Hebrews 6:1–3 warns 
us of such foolishness: “Let us not lay again the foundation of repentance, 
faith, water-baptism, baptism in the Holy Spirit, and teaching about resur-
rection and the final judgement.”  All  of  that  is  just  the  foundation.  The  
writer says that we must then press on to perfection – that is building the 
house. After we have converted people to Christ through evangelism, we 
must make those converts disciples of Jesus who follow Him and press 
on to perfection.
So  Haggai’s  message  is  not  about  laying  the  foundation.  It  is  about  
perfection – completing the building, the Body of Christ. What is the differ-
ence between a congregation and the house of God? If you cut out 50,000 
stones from a quarry and bring them to the building site, that is evange-
lism. These stones symbolise people who are born again. But they are not 
a building as yet. They are just a pile of stones. That is what most evan-
gelical congregations today are. These stones must now be built up, being 
placed next to each other, if they are to be an expression of Christ’s Body. 
That is the difficult part – to build them together into the house of God.
Many  churches  today  are  mere  congregations,  where  one  man  (the  
pastor), like a watchman, has to ensure that no-one steals his “stones”. 
When one of his “stones” decides one day to join another church where 
he  can  receive  more  spiritual  help,  the  watchman  will  complain  that  
others  are  stealing  “his  stones”!  But  if  he  had  built  that  stone  into  a  
building, it would have been impossible for anyone to steal it. If you build 
the Body of Christ, you won’t have to worry about others stealing your 
members. When stones are built together and cemented, with stones on 
top of them, under them, and to their left and right, who can steal them? 
I have led a church in Bangalore since 1975; but I have never complained 
that  anyone  stole  anyone  from  our  church.  Those  who  are  being  built  
together as a body in our midst cannot be stolen. So let us build God’s 
house and not just lay a foundation and accumulate stones.
Notice  the  strong  rebuke  the  Lord  gives  in  1:9–11.  There  is  a  great  
need in our churches for preachers who know how to speak a word of 
rebuke in love. There is plenty of preaching nowadays, but very little 
rebuke and correction. When God allows defeat or constant failure in 
your life, you need to stop and listen to what He is trying to tell you. 
Ask yourself, “Why is the fruit of the Spirit missing in my life? Why is 
my  family-life  in  a  mess?  Why  is  there  no  rain  from  heaven?  Why  is  
there a dryness in my life?” (1:9–11). It may be because you are more 
concerned about earthly matters and your bank account than about 
your walk with the Lord!
When  Zerubbabel  and  Joshua  the  high  priest  heard  this  prophecy,  
they responded to Haggai’s message immediately and said, “We will start 

504 Through the Bible: Encouragement to do the Lord’s Work 
Haggai
building God’s house straightaway.” Or symbolically, “We will not engage 
in  mere  evangelism  henceforth.  We  will  make  disciples  as  well.  We  will  
build Christ’s Body and not a one-man church.” The church is to be like 
a functioning body – and not a pile of body parts, as found in anatomy 
laboratories  –  where  they  have  many  hands,  legs,  eyes  and  ears  lying  
around, but none of them connected with each other by life. And so they 
cannot function together. Many churches today are exactly like that.
“Then Haggai, the Lord’s messenger, gave the people the Lord’s message” 
(1:13). Haggai was first the Lord’s messenger, and then he gave people 
the Lord’s message. You can listen to an anointed message on a tape 
and  repeat  that  –  and  that  may  be  the  Lord’s  message.  But  Haggai  
was first the Lord’s messenger. To become the Lord’s messenger, you 
have to allow God to do a work of crushing in you first, as He did with 
Hosea.  Haggai  doesn’t  tell  us  how  God  crushed  him  in  his  younger  
days and broke him or what deep trials he had to go through. Many 
servants of God will never tell us all that they went through. But every 
servant of God, whom God has ever used has had a private history of 
God’s dealings with him, where he was broken, crushed, humbled and 
taken through loss of money and reputation etc. Only thus does one 
become the Lord’s messenger.
There  is  a  difference  between  the  Lord’s  messenger  giving  the  Lord’s  
message  and  someone  else  giving  the  same  message.  There  will  be  an  
anointing of God in the first case which will be absent in the second – 
because  the  anointing  comes  on  the  messenger primarily,  not  on  the  
message. The Holy Spirit does not come upon books and tapes. He comes 
upon people. I know that there are ignorant preachers who lay hands on 
books and tapes and ask the Lord to anoint them. But what they pray for 
does not happen. It is people whom God anoints, not books and tapes.
The  Spirit  stirred  these  men  through  Haggai’s  prophecy  to  action.  
“The Lord sparked the enthusiasm of Zerubbabel, Joshua and the whole 
remnant of God’s people and they came and began the work on the house of 
the Lord” (1:14). That proved that there was an anointing on the message. 
To those who preach the Word, I would say, “Don’t be satisfied until your 
preaching stirs people to act.” Don’t be satisfied with their shaking your 
hands and merely saying it was a good message. If your message has not 
stirred people to turn from their sins and to become disciples of Jesus, 
then you need to seek God for a greater anointing of His Spirit. Here we 
see that within 23 days things began to happen that had not happened 
for 16 years (1:1, 15). That is the difference that one prophet made. The 
professional preachers among the Jews who preached every Saturday for 
16 years did nothing. But one prophet shook everybody up and things 
began to happen. Be a man like Haggai – be the Lord’s messenger.

Second Message – The Temple Will Be Glorious (2:1–9)                                                                   505
Haggai
Second Message – The Temple Will Be Glorious (2:1–9)
The  Lord  asks  the  older  people  among  the  Jews, “Is  there  anyone  who  
can remember this house – the Temple – as it was before? In comparison, 
how does it look to you now? It must seem like nothing at all! (2:3). This 
new temple could not possibly match the glory of the one that Solomon 
built.  But  the  Lord  said,  “Take  courage  and  work  –  for  I  am  with  you” 
(2:4). And then the Lord said “The ‘Desire of all nations’ shall come – 
and (then) the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former” 
(2:7–9 - KJV). The “Desire of all Nations” refers to the Lord Jesus. He was 
the brightness of God’s glory and when He entered this new temple (500 
years  later),  then  the  glory  of  this  latter  temple  would  be  greater  than  
anything in Solomon’s temple. 
This  last  statement  also  shows  that  the  glory  of  the  “new  covenant  
temple  of  God  –  the  church”  would  be  far,  far  greater  than  that  of  the  
“old covenant temple”. Solomon’s temple had an external glory that was 
temporary. The new covenant church does not have any external glory, 
but  it  has  something  far  better  –  an  inner  glory  that  is  eternal!  What  
happened on the day of Pentecost far surpassed anything that you read 
of in the entire Old Testament. 
They needed a lot of money to rebuild the temple. The Lord knew that, 
and so He says, “The silver is Mine, the gold is Mine” (2:8). God Himself 
would  provide  all  the  money  they  needed.  Doesn’t  the  Lord  know  that  
we need money today also – for His work? Then why do we ask men for 
money? Why not go to the Owner of all the silver and gold in the world 
and ask Him? After all, the work is His and not ours. Then why not trust 
Him to provide for all the needs of His work? Why then do most pastors 
and preachers beg from men for God’s work?
Jesus needed money to live. He had to take care of His own expenses 
as well as that of His 12 apostles and their dependent families. God knew 
that, and so He arranged for some rich families to give money to Jesus 
for His work (Luke 8:2, 3). Jesus received their gifts, but He never asked 
anyone  for  money  or  made  His  financial  needs  known  to  anyone.  He 
trusted His Father, the Owner of all the silver and gold in the world, to 
provide all His earthly needs. The apostles followed Jesus’ example and 
made their needs known only to God. No servant of God under the new 
covenant ever mentioned his earthly needs to any man. They all trusted 
their heavenly Father to provide.
We also need money today to rent a house, to buy food and clothes, 
to  educate  our  children,  and  for  the  work  of  the  Lord.  The  Lord  says,  
“I   know it all.” He is not unsympathetic to our need. Let us then follow 
the example of Jesus and the apostles and do what they did. Our heav-
enly Father says to us, “The silver is Mine. The gold is Mine. Everything 
that you need for your family and your work, I will provide abundantly, if 
you trust in Me. Don’t go begging from man.”

Haggai
Third Message – The Obedient Will Be Blessed (2:10–19)
Now we come to the third message. The first message was about complet-
ing the temple. The second was about the glory of the temple. The third 
message is about holiness and sin. Whenever any prophet spoke about 
building  God’s  house,  the  very  next  thing  he  spoke  about  always  was  
holiness.  You  cannot  build  the  house  of  God,  if  you  do  not  emphasise  
holiness. This is the mistake that numerous preachers and pastors are 
making today.
The Lord says, “Ask the priests this question about the law: ‘If one of 
you is carrying a holy sacrifice in his robes and happens to brush against 
some other food, will that also become holy?’ The priests replied, ‘No.’ Then 
Haggai asked, ‘But if someone becomes ceremonially unclean by touching 
a dead person and then brushes against any food, will it be defiled?’ And 
the priests answered, ‘Yes.’ ” (2:11–13).
The message here is just this: Holiness cannot be transmitted from one 
to another, but sin can.
A more modern illustration will perhaps help us understand this better. 
In a hospital’s operating theatre, the equipment is all sterilised and free 
from germs. If you take one of those sterilised knives and touch a dirty 
cloth with it, will that cloth become sterilised and free from germs? No. 
On  the  other  hand,  if  you  reverse  the  process  and  take  the  dirty  cloth  
and touch that sterile knife with it, that knife will immediately become 
infected with the germs on the cloth.
So what do we learn from this parable? Just this that sin is very conta-
gious, but holiness is not.
It  takes  a  lot  of  time  and  effort  to  make  a  knife  in  a  hospital  sterile.  
But how long does it take to pollute it? Just a moment. Even so: It is very 
easy for someone to make you sinful. But it is very difficult for anyone 
to  make  you  holy.  Sin  is  communicated  very  easily,  but  not  holiness. 
Remember that.
Then the Lord went on to say, “Therefore whatever you offer is defiled” 
(2:14). Even if the offering itself was ceremonially pure, their hands were 
defiled by sin, and so their offerings were defiled too. This is what the 
Lord is saying to the church today too. The prayers that believers pray 
may sound fervent and “holy”. There may be loud Amens and Hallelujahs 
from others too. But if there is sin in a person’s life, his prayers are sinful. 
If  you fight with your wife, how can you offer a pure prayer to God without 
setting matters right with your wife first? Your unholy life communicates 
sin  to  your  prayer.  People  may  be  impressed  by  your  prayer;  but  God  
rejects it, because there was “sin in your holy activity” (Exodus 28:38).
The Lord then urged the people to set right their sins and concluded 
with  this  promise,  “From  this  day  onward  I  will  bless  you”  (2:19).  He  
desires to bless us. It is only our sin that robs us of that blessing.

Fourth Message – Zerubbabel Will Be Honoured (2:20–23)                                                             507
Haggai
Fourth Message – Zerubbabel Will Be Honoured (2:20–23)
The final message was a personal one for Zerubbabel “I  will  overthrow  
royal thrones and overturn their chariots and charioteers. But when this 
happens,  I  will  honor  you,  My  servant.  I  will  treat  you  like  a  signet  ring  
on My finger, for I have specially chosen you”  (2:22,  23).  The  ring  here  
symbolises the anointing of the Holy Spirit. When the prodigal son came 
back, the father put a ring on his finger – a picture of God anointing 
repentant sinners with the Holy Spirit.
Haggai was a real prophet. He exalted Zerubbabel and hid himself. He 
said, “Zerubbabel, you are going to lead these people in building God’s 
house. The ring will be on your finger. My ministry was just to encourage 
these people and then to disappear.” True prophets never got any honour 
from men. Kings like David got honour. And governors like Zerubbabel 
got honour. But the prophets fulfilled their ministry and disappeared. 
Their  honour  will  come  to  them  when  Christ  returns.  Be  a  servant  of  
God who proclaims His words and seeks no honour from Christendom 
or from anyone on this earth. Encourage others, push them forward. Let 
them be the leaders and the elders. Let others have their titles and be the 
chairman and the directors of the Board and have the honour and the 
money. As for you, proclaim God’s word and then hide yourself. Jesus 
has given us a wonderful example in this area. Follow His example and 
be a true servant of God.



ZECHARIAH
The ‘Revelation’ of  
The Old Testament
Z
echariah  was  a  young  man  who  prophesied  along  with  Haggai  
when the people came back from Babylon as a remnant to build 
the  temple.  Haggai  and  Zechariah  prophesied  together.  We  never  
see two prophets working together anywhere else in the Old Testament. 
Elijah, Elisha and Jonah all worked alone. Even though Jeremiah and 
Habakkuk lived at the same time, we never see them working together. 
They prophesied separately. 
In that sense, Haggai and Zechariah were different from all the other 
Old Testament prophets. Towards the close of the old-covenant period, 
God was preparing people for the new covenant – in which nobody works 
by himself. As soon as Jesus started His ministry, He sent out His disci-
ples two  by  two  –  preparing  them  for  the  new  covenant.  Fellowship  is  
a  fundamental  necessity  in  the  new  covenant.  So,  as  we  approach  the  
end of that old covenant period, here we find a wonderful example of an 
older man like Haggai and a much younger man like Zechariah working 
together.
Although  Zechariah  was  younger  than  Haggai,  God  gave  him  much  
more to prophesy. God is no respecter of age. He began to give Zechariah 
visions and prophetic messages when he was very young (2:4). Jeremiah 
too was a young man when God called him to prophesy. This is a great 
encouragement for all who are young. God can pick you up when you are 
young, anoint you with His Holy Spirit, team you up with an older, godly 
brother like Haggai, and finally, give you a wider ministry even than him. 
Haggai was a gracious, godly, old man who not only pushed Zerubbabel 
forward (as we saw earlier), but also pushed young Zechariah forward. 
A true man of God is always like that. He pushes younger people forward 
and  pulls  back  himself.  In  India,  where  the  need  is  so  great,  we  need  

510 Through the Bible: The ‘Revelation’ of The Old Testament 
Zechariah
older  men  like  that  –  who  will  train  younger  people  to  take  over  their  
ministry and then pull out and move elsewhere where the Lord has need 
of him. This is how it should be with every prophet. It’s not God’s will that 
a man called to be a prophet should settle down in one ministry forever. 
Haggai was a wonderful example of a true prophet.
Zechariah had a blessed ministry of encouraging discouraged people. 
These  Jews  had  just  come  back  from  Babylon  where  their  fathers  had  
been  slaves,  and  they  were  poor,  fearful  and  discouraged.  They  were  a  
beaten lot. They were not cultured, refined or rich like their forefathers 
of 200 years earlier. Zechariah was called to encourage them. Because 
they received Haggai’s message, God sent them more messages through 
Zechariah. If you receive the message of one prophet, then God will send 
you another. But if you don’t receive the message of one prophet, then 
God will not send you any more of His servants.
The Lord begins by telling His people through Zechariah that He was 
very  angry  with  their  ancestors  who  had  been  taken  captive  70  years  
earlier (1:2). He warned them not to be like those ancestors but to listen 
to the prophets and to return to the Lord (1:3–5). The things that God 
had spoken through His prophets to their ancestors had all been fulfilled 
exactly. It was only after they were taken captives that those ancestors 
repented and said, “We have received what we deserved from the Lord. 
He  has  done  what  He  said  He  would  do”  (1:6).  It  is  a  pity  that  most  
Christians too repent only when they are chastened by the Lord and not 
when they hear God’s Word through his servants.
We  can  divide  the  book  of  Zechariah  into  three  parts:  First  of  all,  in  
Chapters 1 to 6 Zechariah was given eight visions – each of which had 
a  spiritual  meaning.  Then  in  Chapters  7  and  8,  he  is  given  messages  
on different topics – such as hypocrisy, disobedience and Israel’s resto-
ration. The final section (Chapters  9  to  14)  is  about  the  Messiah  –  the  
Messiah rejected and finally returning in glory and reigning over all the 
earth.
Zechariah’s burden is the movement of God’s people from Babylon to 
Jerusalem.  Jerusalem  was  the  burden  of  all  these  prophets.  Haggai’s  
burden was the temple. Zechariah’s was not just the temple, but the city 
of Jerusalem itself which symbolised the church of God.
Zechariah’s Visions
The first vision Zechariah sees is of a man sitting on a red horse among 
some  myrtle  trees  (1:7–17).  Myrtle  trees  are  low  trees  and  symbolise  
humility.  Behind  the  man  were  red,  brown  and  white  horses.  “And  I  
asked, ‘What are these for?’ And they said, ‘We have patrolled the earth.’ 
They reported to the angel of the Lord, ‘The whole earth is at peace.’ ” This 
is a picture of God watching everything that happens on the earth. “Then 
the angel said to me, ‘Shout this message for all to hear: “This is what the 

Zechariah’s Visions                                                                                                                                   511
Zechariah
Lord  Almighty  says:  ‘My  love  for  Jerusalem  and  Mount  Zion  is  passion-
ate  and  strong.  I  have  returned  to  show  mercy  to  Jerusalem.  My  temple  
will be rebuilt and plans will be made for the reconstruction of Jerusalem. 
The Lord will comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem as His own.’”’ ” (1:9–17). 
‘Jerusalem’ and ‘Mount Zion’ symbolise the church, the body of Christ on 
earth that will be built, despite all the opposition of Satan and his forces.
The message that comes to us from this is that even though the church 
is  small  and  in  a  low  place,  she  has  the  God  Who  runs  the  universe  
watching over her as she seeks to build His house. When you are in a 
lonely place, you can feel weak and helpless. But remember that the eyes 
of the Lord are always going across the earth, working on your behalf. 
The Lord’s love for the church is “passionate and strong”. That was how 
Zechariah encouraged the people to build God’s house.
The second vision was of four animal horns and four blacksmiths (1:18–
21). The horns represented at that time, the world powers that had ruled 
Judah  and  Israel  at  some  time  –  Egypt,  Assyria,  Babylon  and  Medo-
Persia.  In  our  time,  they  represent  the  forces  of  darkness  that  attack  
the church from all four sides – north, south, east and west. Horns in 
the Bible are a picture of strength. So these horns represent the gates of 
Hades, the forces of spiritual death. These horns had “scattered” God’s 
people (1:19). The work of the devil is always to scatter and divide believ-
ers  –  separating  them  by  gossip,  slander,  misunderstanding  and  false  
report. Satan is in this business perpetually.
“Against these four horns the Lord showed me four blacksmiths” (1:20). 
These  blacksmiths  would  destroy  the  horns.  Blacksmiths  are  strong  
people who hammer iron into shape. The blacksmiths had come to terrify 
the four horns that had scattered and humbled Judah. They would throw 
those  enemies  down  and  destroy  them.  These  represented  God’s  serv-
ants – Haggai, Zechariah, Joshua and Zerubbabel. Today God raises up 
prophets in the north, south, east and west, to terrify Satan. You must 
be one of those servants of God who terrify Satan (1:21).
Most believers are themselves terrified by Satan and demons! Once, 
when I encountered a demon possessed man, he looked so fiercely at 
me, that I was taken aback momentarily. I immediately asked myself 
one  question  to  strengthen  my  faith:  “Was  this  demon  conquered  on  
Calvary, or did this one escape?” I knew the answer immediately. Satan 
and every one of his demons were conquered on Calvary. None of them 
escaped. Faith rose in my heart immediately and I cast out that demon 
in  the  Name  of  their  Conqueror,  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  So  we  need  
never be afraid of Satan or of his demons. When you see Satan working 
intensely in your home or in your church, or when he stirs up people 
against  you,  ask  yourself  this  question:  “Was  Satan  defeated  on  the  
cross?”

512 Through the Bible: The ‘Revelation’ of The Old Testament 
Zechariah
We are to terrify Satan. How was it when Jesus walked on this earth? 
Wherever He went, Satan was scared. The demons would scream to one 
another: “Jesus is coming. Jesus is coming here. Let us run away.” The 
Bible  says  that,  “as  Jesus  is,  so  are  we  in  this  world”  (1  John  4:17).  If  
you are walking with a clear conscience, in humility and have no desire 
on earth but to glorify God, then wherever you go the demons will say 
the same thing that they said about Jesus, “Hey, he is coming here. She 
is coming here. This person is not like the other Christians. This one is 
living in humility and with a clear conscience. We’re in danger. Let’s get 
out of here.”
Isn’t it wonderful that we can be like those blacksmiths in God’s hands 
to  hammer  the  devil’s  work  and  to  destroy  it?  And  we  must  become  
stronger and stronger as we grow older – and not like many  preachers 
nowadays who become fatter and richer and less anointed as they grow 
older!  Fast,  eat  less,  live  more  simply  and  give  away  what  you  don’t  
need to those who are poorer, and seek a greater anointing, as you grow 
older! That is how a true servant of God must live. Don’t go the way that 
Christendom and its leaders are going today. Go in another direction – 
the way Jesus and the early apostles went. They went from strength to 
strength as they grew older.
There  is  a  lovely  promise  in  Deuteronomy  33:25  that  says,  “As  your  
days, so shall your strength be” (KJV). I want to claim that all the days of 
my life. You young people should claim it from your youth onwards. Say, 
“Lord, I want to be one who terrifies Satan.”
In the third vision, Zechariah sees a man going to measure the length and 
breadth of Jerusalem (2:1–13). This vision symbolises man determining 
the strength of a church by the number of its members. But the Body 
of Christ has only one membership list – the Book of Life. And the Lord 
teaches us here how to really measure the church.
Another angel comes and tells Zechariah, “Jerusalem will someday be 
so full of people that it won’t have any room for everyone. Many will live 
outside the city walls. Yet they will be safe.” This was a small group of 
people  and  they  were  thinking,  “Who  will  come  and  join  this  despised  
group of ours? The other Jews are all living so comfortably in Babylon. 
But here we are, a small, despised group trying to build God’s temple. 
Who is interested in what we are doing?”
The angel came to encourage them and said, “Don’t worry. People from 
here and there will hear about you and will come and join you one day. 
Today you may be small. All of God’s work starts very small. But if God 
can find leaders who will stay true and not compromise His principles, 
then even if they are small, one day from north, south, east and west 
those who have a hunger for godliness and reality, will gradually hear 
of your group, and come and join you because they will recognise that 
God is in your midst and that you have life.

Zechariah’s Visions                                                                                                                                   513
Zechariah
The  Lord  then  told  them,  “I myself will be a wall of fire round about 
Jerusalem  (the  church)”  (2:5).  The  church  does  not  have  any  earthly,  
denominational  walls.  You  can’t  come  inside  it  by  signing  a  doctrinal  
statement. Everyone has to come through that wall of fire if he is to 
become a part of the true church. That fire will burn up all his earthly 
ambitions and his desire to live for himself. Only then can he become a 
part of the Body of Christ.
Picture a city surrounded by a wall of fire. How can you enter that city? 
Only by going through the wall of fire. Everything that can be burnt will 
be burnt up by God as you enter through that wall. Only what cannot 
be burnt will go through the fire. “Our God is a consuming fire” (Hebrews 
12:29). “Who can dwell with the consuming fire?” (Isaiah 33:14).
Preachers,  through  the  years,  have  thrown  water  on  that  fire  and 
quenched it so that nowadays anyone can walk in and join the church, 
while still retaining all their worldly ideas, their worldly ambitions and 
their love of the world. You can be certain that God is not in such a 
church, because wherever He dwells, He will be a wall of fire around 
that church.
And then God goes on to say, “I will be the glory in the midst of it.” If 
you want the glory of God to be in your church, then you must allow Him 
to be a wall of fire around your church. The two go together. If you say 
that God’s standards are too high and you throw water on the fire, then 
God’s glory will not be in your church either. When the wall of fire goes 
away, the glory goes away too. Doctrine is important. But no doctrine can 
be a wall of fire. God Himself has to be the wall of fire. The most impor-
tant thing in a church is not right doctrine but the glory of God. If that 
is there, right doctrine will follow. If that is not there, mere rightness of 
doctrine is useless.
“Come away from Babylon. Escape to Jerusalem” (2:6). What a word that 
is! We need to proclaim it to God’s people even today! Every believer has 
to make a choice to come out of Babylon. God will not catch anyone by 
the scruff of his neck and pull him out. The responsibility is the indi-
vidual’s.  You  have  to  make  that  decision.  But  personally  speaking,  I  
never want to be part of any religious system that does not honour God 
and His Word. I want to be with the wholehearted people of God who 
gather within this wall of fire and have the glory of God in their midst.
If  you  are  seeking  to  build  a  church,  then  build  a  church  like  this.  
Any other type of church is useless. But you have to pay a price to build 
a church like this. You can’t just imitate a pattern that you have seen 
somewhere and try and reproduce that. God has to burn up everything 
that can be burnt up in your life first, before you can build a church that 

514 Through the Bible: The ‘Revelation’ of The Old Testament 
Zechariah
pleases Him. So make sure that every earthly ambition in you is burnt 
up. Make sure that you don’t love anything that God does not love, and 
that you hate everything that God hates. Then you can be a man/woman 
whom God uses to build His church.
The Lord then says, “Shout and rejoice, for I am coming to live among 
you” (2:10). As a result, many nations will come and join themselves to 
the Lord because they see that God is in the midst of his people (2:11).
Then we come to the fourth vision (3:1–10). This was a vision of cleansing 
and crowning – the cleansing and crowning of Joshua the High Priest. 
There  are  two  great  movements  in  Israel’s  history  –  one  from  Egypt  to  
Canaan, and the other from Babylon to Jerusalem. And in both of these, 
there is a Joshua! There is a Joshua who led Israel to Canaan and there 
is a Joshua who is the High Priest in Jerusalem. This is not just a coinci-
dence. ‘Joshua’ is the Hebrew word for ‘Jesus’, meaning ‘Saviour’. Jesus 
is the One Who leads us to victory over every giant of sin, and He is also 
the One Who intercedes for us as our High Priest.
But I want you to look at Joshua here as a leader among God’s people. 
This  leader  had  sin  in  his  life,  but  not  deliberate,  known  sin.  If  it  had  
been deliberate sin, it would have been a very serious matter. Paul could 
only say, “I don’t know anything against myself. My conscience is clear. 
But  the  One  who  judges  me  is  the  Lord.  There  are  many  things  that  He  
sees which I cannot see. As and when God shows me some sin, I confess 
it and forsake it and He cleanses me” (1 Corinthians 4:4 - Paraphrase).
We  can  sin  consciously  and  unconsciously.  All  of  us  will  sin  uncon-
sciously and accidentally until the day we die. Leaders too can sin in 
these ways. No leader anywhere in the world is perfectly Christlike. Even 
the apostle Paul had not reached that degree of perfection. Consider 
one  proof  of  this:  When  they  slapped  Paul  in  the  court  of  the  high  
priest, Paul got angry and told the high priest, “God will smite you, you 
whitewashed wall” (Acts 23:3). But when they slapped Jesus, He did 
not threaten the high priest. This was the difference between Christ’s 
reaction  and  Paul’s.  (However,  Paul  confessed  his  sin  and  asked  for  
forgiveness, and thus set the matter right immediately).
No-one  can  be  sinlessly  perfect  on  this  earth.  We  can  become  like  
Jesus  only  when  He  returns.  So  even  the  leaders  among  God’s  people  
will have some defect or the other in them. There are defects in the great-
est of prophets in the church. But we should not allow ourselves to be 
disturbed  by  those  defects.  I  am  not  referring  to  sins  like  committing  
adultery and loving money. Those are serious matters and are certainly 
not unconscious sin! I am referring to small defects that are not serious, 
but that are still un-Christlike.
Joshua the high priest was standing before the Lord and Satan stood 
there  to  accuse  him.  Satan  is  always  seeking  to  accuse  and  harm  the  

Zechariah’s Visions                                                                                                                                   515
Zechariah
leaders. He targets them and their wives and children. Don’t be harsh in 
judging a leader, because he is a bigger target of Satan than you are. His 
wife and children are bigger targets of Satan than your wife and children. 
Satan  stood  there  to  accuse  Joshua  to  the  Lord.  But  the  Lord  replied  
saying,  “I  the  Lord  reject  your  accusations”  (3:2).  We  have  an  Advocate  
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. Sometimes we are so taken 
up with the accuser that we forget all about our Advocate Who is praying 
for us.
There are two ministries going on in heaven right now. One is Satan’s, 
accusing. He accused Job and Joshua. At the same time, there is another 
ministry  going  on  in  heaven.  “Jesus  ever  lives  to  make  intercession  for  
us”  (Hebrews  7:25).  The  two  ministries  are  a  ministry  of  accusation  
and a ministry of intercession. Those who are in fellowship with Satan 
will accuse other believers. Every time you gossip or speak evil against 
another believer, whether you know it or not, you are holding hands with 
Satan saying, “I agree with you, Satan. He is like that.” And every time 
you pray for a brother who is weaker, you are holding hands with Jesus 
and saying, “Lord, I agree with You. We have to pray for that brother and 
deliver him from that problem.” How many times have you held hands 
with Satan and how many times have you held hands with Jesus? You 
know. Let it be different in the coming days.
When Joshua was being accused, the Lord said, “I reject your accusa-
tions.” This is what I say too, when people come to me with accusations. 
When people come to me in my house and accuse a brother, I tell them, 
“Let me call that brother immediately and tell him what you have told 
me.”  Invariably  the  accuser  says,  “No.  Please  don’t  do  that.”  I  reply,  
“I   must. I am faithful to all my brothers. If someone had told me some-
thing about you, I would have called you immediately and told you. So 
when you tell me something about somebody else, I must call him and 
tell him too.” Do you know what the result of my approach has been? 
My  house  has  been  protected  from  being  a  place  of  gossip.  I  would  
encourage you to do what I have done.
The Lord replied to Satan saying, “I reject your accusations. This man 
is a child of God. He is a burning stick that I snatched out of the fire.” 
Since Joshua’s garments were filthy, the angel said, “Take away his filthy 
clothes.” This is a picture of Jesus our Advocate pleading for us saying, 
“Take away his filthy clothes. Put new clothes on him.” And Joshua stood 
there clothed now in the righteousness of Christ. That is how we must 
see all of God’s children – clothed in the righteousness of Christ. And now 
we come to the best part. Zechariah was so excited seeing all this that 
he joined the Lord in spirit and said, “Lord, this is wonderful. Now put 
a nice turban on his head as well.” He joined Jesus in making his filthy 
brother glorious.

516 Through the Bible: The ‘Revelation’ of The Old Testament 
Zechariah
Do you want to share in this ministry of “making your brother glorious”?
What does this mean in practical terms? It means that when someone 
comes along and accuses a brother to me, I reply saying, “But you know 
he  has  some  good  qualities  too.”  And  I  name  some  of  them.  All  of  a  
sudden the accuser’s mouth is shut. This is a wonderful ministry to have 
– even when we pray. John Hyde (known as ‘Praying Hyde’) was a great 
American missionary in North India in the early 20
th
 century. He relates 
an incident where he was praying and began to tell the Lord about the 
weaknesses of a certain pastor. All of a sudden, he felt as if he was being 
choked. The Holy Spirit told him not to get into a ministry of accusation, 
but to intercede for that man. He learned that day not to accuse people 
even in prayer!
Don’t join the devil in criticising God’s people. Instead pray for them. 
Whenever the Lord reminds you of a sincere servant of God, pray for 
him. He may be facing some Satanic attack at that very moment. Ask 
the Lord to protect his family and to bless his ministry.
This does not mean that we should ignore error or overlook sin. Sins 
and errors in doctrine need to be exposed ruthlessly, as the prophets of 
old did. But there must be no smell of the spirit of the Accuser in our 
words.
In the fifth vision, the Lord showed Zechariah a gold lampstand with a 
bowl on top of it, to hold the oil (4:1–14). On each side of the lampstand 
was  an  olive  tree  with  a  pipe  coming  from  it  to  the  bowl.  In  the  Old  
Testament temple, the priests had to pour oil into the lampstand each 
day to replenish the oil used up. But here the oil flowed from the trees 
directly  to  the  lampstand.  This  lampstand  is  a  picture  of  the  church  
and the flow of oil symbolises the continuous ministry of the Holy Spirit 
anointing the church (Revelation 1:20).
The two trees symbolise anointed servants of God whom the Lord uses 
to keep the church fresh and Spirit-filled at all times (4:14). They  are  
filled  with  the  Spirit  themselves  and  in  touch  with  the  Spirit  always. 
Every time you meet them, oil flows out of them to bless you. The church 
needs many servants of God like that.
Haggai  and  Zechariah  were  two  such  men  who  could  work  together.  
Every servant of God needs to have his ministry balanced by the minis-
try  of  another  servant  of  God.  One  tree  pours  oil  from  one  side  and  the  
other tree from the other side. One person emphasises grace and the other 
emphasises truth. But together, they manifest the glory of God that was 
seen in Christ and the lampstand of the church burns brightly (John 1:14).
Where two brothers can work together like that for the building of the 
church – both filled with the Holy Spirit, without competition, jealousy, 
personal  ambition,  or  any  desire  to  show  oneself  better  than  the  other  

Zechariah’s Visions                                                                                                                                   517
Zechariah
–  but  only  desiring  that  the  lampstand  should  burn,  they  can  build  a  
church against which the gates of hell will never be able to prevail. This 
could be Joshua and Zerubbabel, or Haggai and Zechariah, or any two 
brothers  or  a  husband  and  wife  working  together  for  the  Lord.  This  is  
new covenant ministry.
This  was  what  the  Lord  said  to  Zerubbabel,  “It  won’t  be  by  human  
might or power, but by My Spirit. Every mountain will be flattened in front 
of you” (4:6). When the church moves forward in this way, filled with the 
Spirit, the gates of hell will not be able to prevail against it.
In Chapter 2, we saw the ministry of God the Father being a wall of fire 
round about the church. In Chapter 3, we saw the ministry of God the 
Son as the Advocate of God’s leaders and God’s people. In Chapter 4, we 
see God the Holy Spirit filling and anointing the church. So we see the 
whole trinity in these three chapters.
Then  we  come  to  the  sixth  vision.  Here Zechariah sees a flying scroll, 
10  metres  long  and  5  metres  wide  (5:1–4).  The  Lord  said,  “This  scroll  
contains the curse of the law on all those who tell lies and who steal. I am 
sending the curse into the house of every thief and every liar, and My curse 
will destroy that house completely” (5:3, 4). This is a picture of judgement 
on those who disobey God’s Laws, that enters every house and exposes 
sin wherever it is hidden.
In  the  seventh  vision  Zechariah  saw  a  basket  for  measuring  grain  (a  
symbol of business) with a heavy lead cover on it. When the cover was 
lifted, Zechariah saw a woman named “Wickedness” sitting inside. Two 
women then came to take the basket to Babylon to build a temple there for 
it (5:5–11). This vision symbolises the false church in which Christianity 
has become a means of financial profit – where religion and business go 
hand in hand (See “Babylon” in Revelation 17 and 18). The woman hidden 
inside the basket indicates that the hidden motivating force behind much 
that is called Christian work today is the desire to make money. But most 
people do not have the discernment to see through this. Many Christians 
have a lid that covers their own unrighteousness in financial matters. 
But  the  Lord  shows  His  prophets  the  corruption  that  is  found  among  
His people.
We have to ensure that this Babylonian spirit is not permitted to come 
into  the  church.  In  the  days  of  Jesus,  people  did  business  inside  the  
temple and made money in the name of religion. The Israelites could not 
see what was going on. They needed sheep and doves for their offerings 
and felt that these sellers were serving them. But Jesus could see what 
was going on under the lead cover – the motive behind the selling of those 
doves and sheep. They were out to make a neat profit for themselves. 
We see the same thing happening today. Many a preacher makes money 
in  the  name  of  religion,  quoting  verses  like,  “The  labourer  is  worthy  of  

518 Through the Bible: The ‘Revelation’ of The Old Testament 
Zechariah
his hire”, and “The Lord has ordained that those who preach the gospel 
should  live  by  the  gospel.”  But  if  you  look  underneath  this  lead  cover,  
you will see the woman Babylon hiding underneath. Jesus saw this and 
drove those religious racketeers out of the temple.
In  the  eighth  vision,  Zechariah  sees  four  chariots  coming  between  two  
bronze  mountains  (6:1–8).  Bronze  in  the  Bible  symbolises  the  judge-
ment of God on sin. The altar in the tabernacle where the animals were 
sacrificed, was made of bronze. These four chariots came from between 
bronze  mountains.  They  looked  like  uncontrolled  horses.  But  God  had  
control of their reins. There were red, black, white and grey horses, as in 
Revelation  6.  Zechariah  asked,  what  these  represented.  The  reply  was,  
“These are the four spirits of heaven who stand before the Lord of all the 
earth. They are going out to do his work” (Zechariah 6:5). Some were going 
north,  some  to  the  west  and  some  to  the  south.  They  went  across  the  
earth and ministered God’s judgement. Maybe God sent a flood in one 
place and an earthquake in another as a judgement. When these spirits 
returned, the Lord said, “Those who went north have vented the anger of 
My Spirit over there.” (6:8). That means God’s anger was exhausted after 
His judgement on those people.
Then  the  Lord  tells  Zechariah  that  certain  people  would  bring  him  
gifts  of  silver  and  gold  from  the  Jews  in  Babylon.  Zechariah  was  to  
accept their gifts and make a crown from it for Joshua the high priest 
(6:10, 11). When godly people (who are richer than us) give us gifts, we 
can receive them. Elisha accepted the gift of hospitality regularly from a 
rich, God-fearing lady (2 Kings 4:8). But he refused to receive any gifts 
from heathen Naaman (2 Kings 5:15, 16). Jesus also accepted gifts from 
certain  rich,  godly  women  (Luke  8:2,  3).  The  apostles  however  never  
accepted money from unbelievers (3 John 7). But when God gives us gifts 
through others, they are not always for ourselves. We are to use them to 
bless others too. Here Zechariah was told to use all the gold and silver to 
make a crown for Joshua. He was also to encourage Joshua by putting 
the crown on his head and telling him that the LORD says, “Here is the 
man called the Branch. He will build the Temple of the Lord. He will rule as 
king. He will also serve as priest from His throne, and there will be perfect 
harmony between the two” (6:12, 13). This was a prophecy about Christ 
Who would build the true temple of God – the church.
Christ  would  also  be  the  first  King-Priest.  Under  the  old  covenant, 
no-one was allowed to be a king and a priest. King Saul tried to be both 
and lost his kingdom thereby (1 Samuel 13:9–13). King Uzziah also tried 
to be both king and priest and got leprosy (2 Chronicles 26:16–23). Jesus 
was the first One who was to be a King and a Priest. Now He has made us 
king-priests along with Him (Revelation 1:6). The prophecy went on to say 
that people from many countries would come and build the church (6:15).

Zechariah’s Messages                                                                                                                              519
Zechariah
Zechariah’s Messages
The Lord then gave Zechariah some messages on fasting, hypocrisy and 
disobedience  in  Chapters  7  and  8.  The  Lord  told  him  to  tell  the  people  
and  the  priests,  “During  those  seventy  years  of  exile,  when  you  fasted,  
was it really for Me that you were fasting? Even now in your holy festivals, 
you don’t think about Me but only of pleasing yourselves” (7:5, 6).
The  message  that  the  Lord  had  proclaimed  through  all  the  prophets  
was  the  same:  “Be  fair  and  honest.  Show  mercy  and  kindness  to  other  
people. Don’t oppress the poor, the widows, the orphans and the foreign-
ers. Don’t harm each other. Only then will your fasting (and breaking of 
bread)  etc.  be  of  value.  Otherwise  it  is  of  no  use.”  (7:9,  10).  God  cares  
greatly  for  the  poor  and  the  weak  and  the  oppressed.  But  most  of  the  
well-known preachers in the world preach only in the big cities, where the 
rich people are – and they preach “the prosperity gospel” to them. Jesus 
however came to preach the gospel to the poor (Luke 4:18; Matthew 11:5). 
God cares specially for the poor, for the widows and orphans, and for the 
helpless. Every true servant of God will care for them too.
The  ancestors  of  the  Jews  did  not  listen  to  this  message  but  turned  
away from it. That was why the Lord punished them and scattered them 
(7:11).
God is a jealous God. He says that His love for Mount Zion (the church) 
is  passionate  and  strong.  He  is  jealous  that  Jerusalem  (the  church)  
should never become corrupt. The Lord wants to keep His bride “faithful 
and holy” – pure and uncorrupted for Himself (8:1–3).
He goes on to say that in the church, there will be old men and women 
and young boys and girls (8:4, 5). There will be no generation gap in the 
true church of Christ. However old I may be, I want to be able to come 
down to the level of the youngest boys and girls in the church. I love to 
speak to the little boys and girls in every home I visit. Many brothers talk 
only to the older folk when they visit a home. Let us learn to talk to the 
children too. A godly man will always talk to children at their level. Jesus 
was like that.
The other thing we see here is that in the church, the boys and girls 
will be playing games (8:5). They will not be praying all the time. There 
needs  to  be  a  time  for  praying. But  there  should  also  be  a  time  for  
playing. We must encourage games in the church, because that is how 
it will be during the millennial reign of Christ. I am a little too old to run 
around on a soccer field now. But in my spirit, I still love to play games. 
A fellowship is built up between people when they play games together. 
It builds a bond between people. Praise God for a balanced gospel!
The Lord goes on to say, “All this may seem impossible to you now, a 
small and discouraged remnant of God’s people. But do you think this is 
impossible for Me, the Lord Almighty? I will bring My people home again to 

520 Through the Bible: The ‘Revelation’ of The Old Testament 
Zechariah
live safely in Jerusalem (the church). They will be My people, and I will be 
faithful toward them as their God” (8:6, 8). So God tells us to take heart 
and  to  work  until  his  church  is  completed  and  perfected.  “So  don’t  be  
afraid or discouraged, but instead get on with rebuilding the temple (the 
church)!” (8:9–13). It was such a message of encouragement that stirred 
people in Zechariah’s day to work hard to build the temple. And it is the 
word of encouragement that will stir people to build the church today. 
The Lord went on to say that people from all over the world would come 
and seek to be a part of the church because they will recognise that God 
is with the church (8:20–23).
Zechariah’s Burdens
The last section can be divided into two parts: The rejection of the Messiah 
(Chapters  9  to  14)  and  the  reign  of  the  Messiah  on  earth  (Chapters  12  
to 14).
Zechariah first expresses the Lord’s burden of judgement against a 
number of nations for their pride and arrogance (9:1–8). In contrast to 
the “pride of the Philistines” (9:6), the King of Jerusalem would come in 
great humility riding on a donkey and not on a horse (like earthly kings 
did).  “Behold, your king is coming to you.... Humble, and mounted on a 
donkey.... I will remove the battle chariots from Israel and the warhorses 
from  Jerusalem,  and  I  will  destroy  all  the  weapons  used  in  battle.  Your  
king will bring peace” (9:9, 10). The spirit of battle would be replaced by 
the spirit of peace by this humble King. It is in this spirit of humility and 
peace alone that the church can be built.
Then  comes  a  prophecy  of  salvation  from  hell  through  the  blood  of  
Christ: “Because of the covenant I made with you, sealed with blood, I will 
free your prisoners from death in a waterless dungeon” (9:11).
After this comes a prophecy about the second coming of Christ: “The 
Lord will appear above his people ... the Sovereign Lord will sound the 
trumpet; He will go out against his enemies like a whirlwind.... The Lord 
Almighty will protect his people, and they will subdue their enemies.... 
When  that  day  arrives,  the  Lord  their  God  will  rescue  (rapture)  His  
people,  just  as  a  shepherd  rescues  his  sheep.  They  will  sparkle  like  
jewels in a crown. How wonderful and beautiful they will be!” (9:14–17).  
Zechariah speaks much about the second coming of Christ and about 
the defeat of the enemies of the Lord and of the triumph of God’s people 
at that time. 
Zechariah therefore urged God’s people to “ask the LORD for rain and He 
will give it” (10:1). This is the great need in our time – to ask God to pour 
out His Spirit upon us exactly as He sends rain on the parched ground. 
He will certainly give us that outpouring, just as Zechariah prophesied!

Zechariah’s Burdens                                                                                                                                 521
Zechariah
Then Zechariah warns us against false prophets whom he calls “divin-
ers (fortune-tellers)” who speak about false visions that they claim to have 
seen (10:2). They claim to be able to predict the future but actually tell 
lies. There are such so-called “prophets” today in many places to whom 
believers  go  seeking  for  advice.  Invariably  they  seek  advice  concerning  
material things and financial prosperity. Do these “prophets” tell them 
about  their  sins,  like  the  Old  Testament  prophets  did?  No.  They  tickle  
their  ears  with  words  that  make  them  happy.  There  are  such  “fortune 
tellers”  in  every  religion  and  they  all  do  it  for  money.  So  also  do  the  
Christian “fortune-tellers”.  Don’t  be  deceived  by  these  false  prophets  in  
Christendom. Don’t be frightened by their threats or their warnings. And 
don’t be deceived by their promises of prosperity either. The very fact that 
they  want  your  money  proves  that  they  are  false  prophets  and  agents  
of Satan. If they were true representatives of Christ, they would not be 
expecting you to give them any money. That is how you can distinguish 
a “fortune-teller” from a true prophet of God. If you want to find a true 
prophet, look for one who will tell you about your sin and who will lead 
you into a Christlike life of humility and self-denial.
It  is  because  people  listen  to  these  false  prophets  that  they  “wander 
like lost sheep without any shepherd to protect them” (10:2). Therefore the 
Lord  says,  “My  anger  burns  against  these  shepherds,  and  I  will  punish  
these leaders. The Lord Almighty will look after His flock Himself” (10:3).
“From Judah will come the cornerstone, the tent peg, the battle bow, and 
all the rulers. They will be like mighty warriors in battle, trampling their 
enemies in the mud under their feet. Since the LORD is with them as they 
fight, they will overthrow even the horsemen of the enemy”  (10:4–5).  
The  Cornerstone,  tent  peg  and  battle  bow  are  all  pictures  of  Christ.  
The mighty warriors are a picture of the saints of God. The enemies are 
Satan and his hosts and the lusts in our flesh. When the Lord is with 
us, every one of these enemies will be overthrown and trampled under 
our feet (Romans 16:20). “I will strengthen Judah and save Israel; I will 
reestablish  them  because  I  love  them”  (10:6).  The  Lord  will  unite  the  
groups  of  His  people  who  are  separated  from  each  other  (like  Judah  
and Israel) and bring Jews and Gentiles together and establish them 
into one Body.
In Chapter  11,  we  read  again  about  good  shepherds  and  evil  shep-
herds.  The  evil  shepherds  are  the  ones  who  are  interested  in  making  
money.  They  weep  when  the  Lord  exposes  them  and  their  means  of  
making money is gone (11:3). They had oppressed their flock and slaugh-
tered the sheep for profit (11:4–7). 
We  read  then  about  grace  and  unity.  “I  took  two  shepherd’s  staffs,  
naming one Grace and the other Union, and I fed the flock as I had been 
told  to  do”  (11:7).  The  two  most  important  messages  required  in  the  

522 Through the Bible: The ‘Revelation’ of The Old Testament 
Zechariah
church today are concerning “Grace” and “Unity”. Grace will lead us to 
victory over sin (Romans 6:14). Overcoming sin is the clearest proof that 
we  have  come  fully  under  grace.  When  we  get  forgiveness  of  sins,  we  
receive  a  little  bit  of  grace.  But  when  we  come  under  grace  fully,  sin  
cannot rule over us. The first is like a cup of water, the second like a river 
of water. This is one of the most important messages to be proclaimed in 
the church today. Those who experience this grace and the Holy Spirit 
being poured on them must then come to unity with each other. It is not 
unity with everyone who calls himself a Christian, but with all those who 
have received grace and live in victory over sin.
Then comes a prophecy about the betrayal of Christ by Judas, “Give 
me whatever I am worth.... So they counted out thirty pieces of silver. And 
the Lord said to me, ‘Throw it to the potters – this magnificent sum at which 
they valued me!’ So I took the thirty coins and threw them to the potters in 
the Temple of the Lord” (11:12, 13).
God then promises to pour out the Spirit of grace and prayer – or the 
Spirit of grace and groaning – upon His people (12:10). In Romans 6, we 
read about the Spirit of grace. In Romans 8, we read about the Spirit of 
groaning. The Holy Spirit comes as a Spirit of grace helping us to over-
come sin. He also comes as a Spirit of groaning, making us pray and cry 
out to God to build the church.
In that day a fountain will be opened for cleansing from sin. But for 
that  fountain  to  be  opened,  the  Shepherd  will  have  to  be  struck  down  
(13:1, 7). The prophecies here refer to some things that happened at the 
first coming of Christ and some things that will happen at His second 
coming.  When  Christ  returns  in  glory,  God  will  “remove  all  the  false  
prophets and the unclean spirits that inspire them. No one will boast then 
of  a  prophetic  gift!  No  one  will  wear  prophet’s  clothes  to  try  to  fool  the  
people. They will say. ‘I’m not a prophet.’ ” (13:2–4).
And then, Zechariah, like most of the prophets, prophesies about the 
remnant that will stand true to the Lord in the last days (13:8, 9). The 
Lord says concerning this remnant, “I will bring them through the fire 
and make them pure, just as gold and silver are refined and purified 
by fire. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, 
‘These are my people,’ and they will say, ‘The Lord is our God.’ ” (13:9).
In  the  last  chapter,  Zechariah  speaks  about  the  coming  day  of  the  
Lord when Jesus will return and stand on the Mount of Olives and that 
mountain will be split into two (14:3, 4). The nations will be gathered for 
battle around Jerusalem at that time (14:2). The conflict for Jerusalem 
that is raging today is but the first stages of that battle that will erupt 
there just before the return of our Lord. In the day the Lord returns, the 
normal source of light will stop shining and the Lord Himself will be the 
light (14:6, 7).

Zechariah’s Burdens                                                                                                                                 523
Zechariah
The enemies of the Lord will be defeated. Their flesh rotting away and 
their eyes shriveling in their sockets seems to indicate exposure to some 
type of nuclear explosion (14:12). The Lord will then reign from Jerusalem 
as King over all the earth (14:9, 16).
In that day, there won’t be any businessmen in the church (14:21). The 
church will be cleansed of all those who sought to make profit for them-
selves in the name of Christ. The principle of profit (to gain as much as we 
can through Christianity) is the principle of Babylon. But the principle of 
sacrifice (to give as much as I can) is the principle of Jerusalem.



MALACHI
Form Without Power
M
alachi  was  the  last  prophet  that  God  sent  to  Israel  before  John  
the  Baptist  the  forerunner  of  Christ.  He  prophesied  about  430  
years  before  Christ,  towards  the  end  of  Nehemiah’s  time.  Some  
of  the  sins  Malachi  mentions  in  Chapters  2  and  3  are  similar  to  the  
sins  mentioned  in  Nehemiah  13.  Nehemiah’s  warnings  do  not  seem  to  
have  had  much  effect  on  the  Jews  in  Jerusalem.  After  Nehemiah  left  
Jerusalem, the Jews seem to have gone back to their old sinful habits. 
Things were in a really bad state by the time Malachi came on the scene.
God’s  people  have  always  been  dependent  on  godly  leaders  for  their  
spiritual survival.
The Burden of the Lord
The  word  ‘Malachi’  means  ‘My  messenger’.  Like  the  other  prophets,  
Malachi also had a burden. Each prophet had a unique burden given to 
him by God – but all of them were concerned about the lack of holiness 
among God’s people. The burden God lays on your heart is almost always 
an indication of the ministry He has planned for you. So wait on the Lord 
to receive a burden from Him. If you serve the Lord without a burden, 
you will get bored with the Lord’s work after a while, and you are likely 
to  end  up  seeking  after  money,  man’s  honour  or  earthly  comfort.  It  is  
unfortunate that many who claim to be serving the Lord today have no 
God-given burden for their ministry.
God may give one man a burden to work among children and another a 
burden for evangelism. Yet another may be given a burden to teach God’s 
people. God gives different burdens to different members of Christ’s body. 
We must not imitate someone else’s ministry or try to have his burden. 
Don’t force others to have your burden; and don’t allow anyone else to 

526 Through the Bible: Form Without Power
Malachi
give you his burden. Let God Himself give you a burden – the one He has 
planned for you.
Many people have urged me to have a burden for their particular minis-
try  –  usually  evangelism.  But  I  have  always  resisted  such  pressures.  
I  am not interested in having the burden God has given to another. God 
has given me a specific burden and I am determined that that is the 
only ministry I will fulfil. The prophets never allowed anyone to sidetrack 
them from the burden and the ministry God gave them.
If you don’t have any burden at all, you must go to God and ask Him 
to give you a burden. He has a definite task for you to fulfil in the body 
of  Christ  and  you  must  know  what  it  is.  Many  preachers  wander  from  
one ministry to another – joining whichever Christian organisation offers 
them the highest salary. For example, they may start with an apparent 
“burden” for a radio ministry. But if some child-evangelism organisation 
then offers them a higher salary, they suddenly develop a “burden” for 
child-evangelism! A little later, if a Christian literature organisation offers 
them a still higher salary, their “burden” suddenly shifts to a literature 
ministry!!  Such  preachers  are  not  serving  the  Lord.  They  are  religious  
men who are engaged in Babylonian “businesses”. When God gives you a 
burden, you cannot give that up just because some organisation offered 
you better earthly benefits.
The Lord has a complaint here against His people: “I have loved you 
deeply.  And  you  say,  ‘Wherein  have  You  loved  us?’  ”  (1:2).  In  Malachi’s  
prophecy,  we  observe  that  whenever  the  Lord  said  something  to  His  
people, they questioned Him (like they did here) seven times. 
Here they questioned the love of God. That is one way by which Satan 
makes us fall. When Satan tempted Eve, he first planted a doubt about 
God’s  love  in  her  mind.  The  implication  of  the  temptation  was,  “God  
doesn’t really love you. If He did, He would have allowed you to eat this 
beautiful  fruit.”  That  made  Eve  doubt  God’s  love.  She  began  to  think,  
“Perhaps God doesn’t love me”. And then she fell into sin easily.
When the Lord prayed for Peter, He said, “Satan has demanded permis-
sion to sift you like wheat. But I have prayed for you that your faith should 
not fail.” (Luke 22:31, 32). The Lord prayed that, even after Peter had fallen 
into the depths of sin (denying the Lord thrice), he would still believe that 
God loved him. That is faith – and that is what the prodigal son had. After 
he had messed up his life and lost everything, he still believed one thing 
– that his father loved him.
You may have messed up your life too. If so, remember that God still 
loves you. Don’t ever lose faith in that fact. When you have lost everything 
else in the world, hold on to this one unchangeable fact – that God still 
loves you. That is the most important thing to remember in life.
In 1:2–5, God speaks about the sovereign way in which He chose Jacob. 
He said, “I showed My love for you by loving your ancestor Jacob. Yet Esau 
was Jacob’s brother, and I rejected Esau. But I have chosen you.”

The Backslidden Leaders of Israel                                                                                                          527
Malachi
How do we know that God loves us? First of all, because He sent Christ 
to die for our sins. He picked us out from many millions of people in 
the world to be among the few who would find the way to life. Why did 
He choose us? Was it because we were more righteous than others? 
No. We all have unconverted friends and relatives – who are, humanly 
speaking,  better  people  than  we  were.  God  accepted  us  because  we  
recognised that we were sinners. Jesus came to call sinners and not 
the righteous. We were sinners whom God picked up from the gutter.
That is one proof of God’s love for us that we should always remember. 
Never forget this fact that out of all the millions of people in the world, 
God  picked  you  out  and  wrote  your  name  in  the  Book  of  Life  before  
He  created  anything  in  this  universe.  That  was  His  sovereign  choice.  
It   says in Romans 9:11–13, “Before they were born, before they had done 
anything good or bad, she (Rebekah) received a message from God. (This 
message proves that God chooses according to His own plan, not accord-
ing  to  our  good  or  bad  works.)  She  was  told,  ‘The  descendants  of  your  
older son will serve the descendants of your younger son.’ In the words of 
the Scriptures, ‘I loved Jacob, but I rejected Esau.’ ” Here we read of the 
sovereignty of God in choosing us. It does not have anything to do with 
good works. And if you think you chose the Lord first, that is also not 
true. In John 15:16, Jesus states very clearly, “You didn’t choose Me, but 
I chose you.” Never forget that.
The Backslidden Leaders of Israel
In 1:6, we read, “The Lord Almighty says to the priests....” Notice again 
how God speaks to the leaders first. Throughout Israel’s history, it was 
always  their  leaders  who  led  them  into  sin.  And  in  the  20  centuries  of  
church history too, it is the leaders who have led the church into compro-
mise  and  worldliness.  Every  now  and  then  in  the  Old  Testament,  God  
would send a prophet to speak to the leaders of Israel. The prophet would 
tell them of their failures. And almost always the leaders would hate him 
and  persecute  him  and  not  allow  him  preach  to  the  common  people.  
They would denounce him as a false prophet. But the prophets did not 
care for any man’s opinion, because they had God’s approval. And they 
didn’t want anyone’s money either, like the false prophets did. The true 
prophets proclaimed the truth even if their message offended the leaders. 
It  has  been  the  same  story  throughout  church  history.  Leaders  of  many  
churches in Christendom today don’t even know God and they certainly 
do  not  know  how  to  speak  a  prophetic  word  from  God.  Therefore,  like  
blind leaders of the blind, they have led their churches into the ditches 
of  compromise  and  worldliness.  But  every  now  and  then,  as  in  olden  
times, God raises up a prophet, to proclaim His word to these churches. 

528 Through the Bible: Form Without Power
Malachi
And invariably such a prophet is rejected by the leaders of these churches 
– because they feel threatened by such a man of God.
What  the  Lord  said  to  the  priests  and  the  leaders  was  (as  it  were),  
“A son honours his father and a servant respects his master. But the Lord 
says, ‘I am your Father and I am your Master. Where is the honour and 
respect you give Me? You have despised My name. You care more for the 
rich people in your congregation than for Me. You don’t care for My word. 
You just want to please those rich people and get their money. Where are 
you honouring Me? Am I really your Father? Am I really your Master? What 
sort of offerings have you given Me? You have given Me offerings that are 
defiled.’ ” (See 1:6–8).
These leaders wanted honour from the people, but they themselves did 
not honour God. They wanted authority over the people, but they would 
not allow the Lord to have any authority over them. A Roman centurion 
once said to Jesus, “I am a man under authority and I have authority over 
the soldiers. I tell a soldier, ‘Go,’ and he goes; to another, ‘Come,’ and he 
comes” (Luke 7:8). To have authority we must be under authority. If we 
want our children to respect us, we must first reverence God. If you want 
your wife to submit to you, you must submit to Christ yourself. That’s 
what the Lord was saying to His people. “How can you demand respect 
from your wives if you don’t respect Me? Am I not your Husband? Only 
in  the  measure  in  which  you  respect  Me,  can  you  expect  respect  from  
your wife.”
If however you seek to please people, how can you say that you rever-
ence God?
“If you offer God sacrifices which are defiled that is an insult to God” 
(1:8) . These people did not fear God. How was that manifested? In that 
they offered blind and lame and sick animals as sacrifices to God. The 
Old Testament law clearly taught that every animal offered for sacrifice 
was to be totally free from blemish. But these Jews kept the good animals 
for themselves, and offered the diseased ones to God. They picked out the 
worst animals in their flocks and gave them to God.
Don’t  Christians  do  that  today?  What  do  many  believers  give  to  the  
Lord? The left-overs. They retire from government service and then want 
to  join  a  Christian  organization  to  “serve  the  Lord”!  They  have  already  
given the best part of their life to the world to make money and now they 
want to give the dregs of their life to the Lord – to make some additional 
money in their retirement years!!
The Lord said, “Try and give that to your Governor and see how happy 
he will be” (1:8). When you give a gift to an earthly governor, do you pick 
out  the  worst  thing  available  in  your  house?  Suppose  the  Governor  of  
the State came to your house and you wanted to give him a cup of tea. 
Would you make a cup of tea, drink most of it yourself and then give him 
the dregs? No. You would not offer that even to a beggar. But that is what 
many believers are offering the Lord. They live for the world for most of 

The Backslidden Leaders of Israel                                                                                                          529
Malachi
their  lives,  and  then  give  the  last  bit  of  their  lives  to  the  Lord.  That  is  
a disgrace. Give the best to the Lord. Give Him your life when you are 
young.
Many believers do the same with their time. After they have spent most 
of their time pursuing all their own interests, they give a little bit of time 
to the Lord. No wonder such believers are not anointed and are spirit-
ually poor.
What about your intelligence? Do you use that to glorify God?
You cannot expect God’s anointing to be upon your life until you have 
learnt to honour Him by giving Him the very best in every area. Give 
Him the full cup of tea before you touch it. Let Him give you the dregs, 
after He has taken what he wants. That is how we must live every day. 
The best part of our life and our time must be for the Lord.
Giving  our  lives  fully  to  the  Lord  does  not  mean  becoming  full  time  
workers. It means putting God first – whether God calls you for full time 
Christian work or to a secular job.
The Jews in Malachi’s day gave the Lord that which cost them nothing. 
They did not know how to worship. To worship God means to give Him 
the very best. Malachi has a message for our time because he prophe-
sied towards the end of the Jewish age. And the state of affairs among 
God’s  people  then  was  very  similar  to  the  state  of  affairs  among  God’s  
people  now  at  the  end  of  the  church  age.  We  need  prophets  today  in  
Christendom with Malachi’s message, to prepare people for the coming 
of the Lord.
“But My name is going to be honoured, and in every place around the 
world, there is going to be a pure testimony for My name” (1:11). This is 
what  God  desires  today  –  in  every  part  of  the  world  from  east  to  west.  
He is not looking for a large offering but a pure offering, in every part in 
India. Speaking in old covenant terms, what is the use of a big bullock if 
it is sick. Let it be a small lamb, but let it be healthy and spotless, a lamb 
without blemish. The Lord looked for quality and not for size or weight in 
those days. Even today, He looks for a pure church and not a large one.
So, if you are building a church, make sure it is a pure church, whatever 
its size. Worldly ways of thinking make most Christians to be impressed 
by size rather than purity. We certainly want many millions to come to 
the Lord. But they must all be disciples and not just people who signed 
a  decision-card  or  who  came  forward  in  an  evangelistic  meeting.  God  
would rather have a small, healthy turtledove than a large, sick bullock!! 
We  read  the  word  “cursed”  in  1:14.  This  word  occurs  seven  times  in  
Malachi – and it is the last word in this book – the last word in the Old 
Testament. [The phrase ‘the Lord of hosts’ however occurs 24 times. The 
Lord who is the Ruler of heaven and earth is the One Whom we serve.]

530 Through the Bible: Form Without Power
Malachi
It  is  easy  to  become  discouraged  and  disappointed  when  you  see  
compromise  and  worldliness  in  Christian  leaders  today.  And  then  it  is  
easy to backslide.
I  faced  many,  many,  many  disappointments  with  Christian  workers,  
Christian churches and Christian organisations in my younger days. But 
it never altered my desire to serve the Lord faithfully until the end of my 
life. I am not here to judge others. But I have decided to give my all to 
the Lord.
In 2:1–3, Malachi’s message is again to the priests. It was like saying, 
“I  am  not  speaking  to  the  congregation.  I  am  speaking  to  the  leaders  
who are sitting on the platform.” “Take it to heart”, the Lord says, “Honor 
my name or I will bring a terrible curse against you. I will curse even the 
blessings you receive. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you 
have not taken my warning seriously. I will rebuke your descendants and 
splatter your faces with the dung of your festival sacrifices, and I will add 
you to the dung heap.”
These  prophets  were  not  gentle,  nice  preachers  who  stood  behind  
ornamented  pulpits  and  said  pleasant  things  to  make  people  happy.  
They used strong words. How would you feel if a preacher came and told 
you, “I’ll splatter your faces with dung”? These prophets spoke strongly 
because things were so bad in Israel. Being nice and gracious and kind 
is  all  right  in  personal  conversation.  But  when  you  stand  up  to  speak  
God’s word you have to be as a lion. You must be a lion in the pulpit and 
a lamb outside. That is what I would recommend to all preachers. That’s 
how Jesus was. He used strong words. And then Malachi said, “You will 
know that I was sent by God with this warning” (2:4).
Qualities of True Servants of God
In 2:5, 6, Malachi compared the Levites of his time with the Levites of old. 
And today, the Lord reminds us of how the first apostles were, how they 
left everything to follow the Lord. “Compare yourself with them,” He says 
to us. The Lord says, “The purpose of My covenant with the Levites was 
to  bring  life  and  peace.  This  was  what  I  gave  them;  and  this  called  for  
reverence from them – and they did greatly revere Me.”
Notice in verses 5 and 6, seven qualities that characterised those early 
Levites – characteristics that should be true of every servant of God.
1. They reverenced God. Reverence for God is the ABC of wisdom.
2. They  had  a  concern  for  God’s  name.  Our  Lord  taught  us  to  pray,  
“Hallowed be Thy name.” We must have a great longing for the name 
of Jesus to be honoured and respected in our land.
3. They  preached  all  of  God’s  truth. Many  preachers  do  not  preach  the  
whole counsel of God, because that would make them unpopular. So 
they become compromisers. I was once invited for meetings to a place 

God’s Servants and Marriage                                                                                                                  531
Malachi
where I was to be the sole speaker. A week before the meetings were to 
commence, the organisers wrote to me and requested me not to speak 
on  the  topic  of  water  baptism  at  any  of  the  meetings,  lest  it  offend  
some of the people. I wrote back saying that in that case they would 
have to find another preacher. I told them that I could not accept an 
invitation to speak anywhere, if I was going to be told what to speak 
and what not to speak. As a servant of the Lord, I would have to speak 
whatever the Lord laid on my heart.
4. They hated sin. They did not lie or cheat. There was a hatred for sin 
in their hearts.
5. They walked with God. They safeguarded their daily walk with God.
6. They lived uprightly. In everything in their life – the way they handled 
money, the way they conducted themselves, etc. – they were upright, 
without any crookedness. 
7. They turned many from sin.
In  those  two  verses,  we  have  a  beautiful  description  of  what  a  true  
preacher should be like. 
“The priests’ lips should guard knowledge, and people should go to them 
for  instruction,  for  the  priests  are  the  messengers  of  the  LORD”  (2:7).  We  
must go to the Lord first and receive His Word and only then go to the 
people and give them His Word. A messenger must have God’s word in his 
mouth. But those Levites, like many today, had left God’s paths, corrupted 
His covenant and caused people to stumble by their preaching (2:8, 9).
God’s Servants and Marriage
In 2:11, Malachi rebukes the people for marrying unbelievers and then 
bringing  offerings  to  the  Lord.  A  servant  of  God  must  have  a  godly  
home. He may not have a godly wife. Many servants of God through the 
centuries, like Job, have had ungodly wives. But that need not hinder 
them from being godly husbands at home. If you are not yet married, 
then you must be careful about the wife you choose. Ask the Lord to 
show  you  whether  the  girl  you  are  considering  is  interested  in  going  
the same way as you are?
And don’t ever marry someone just because she has a pretty face!! The 
people of Judah had married idol-worshipping women, perhaps because 
they were good-looking (2:11). If you marry a woman who loves money 
or who is miserly and tight-fisted, you have married an idol-worshipper. 
When you want to give money for the Lord’s work, you will have to give it 
secretly, without your wife knowing about it. If you want to help others 
secretly, you’ll have to hide that fact from your wife. So ensure that you 
marry someone who has the same goals as you have, someone who loves 
the Lord like you do. 

532 Through the Bible: Form Without Power
Malachi
And once you are married, be totally faithful to your wife – irrespec-
tive  of  whether  she  is  spiritual  or  not.  The  people  here  were  fasting  
and weeping and praying but they were unfaithful to their wives. They 
appeared spiritual on the outside with all their religious activity. But God 
Who saw their private lives, was not listening to any of their prayers.
Someone  has  said  that  what  we  need  today  is  not  more  prayer,  but  
more answered prayer.  Baal’s  prophets  prayed  for  hours,  while  Elijah  
prayed for less than a minute. In the first case, there was plenty of prayer. 
In the second case there was answered prayer. It is easy to find satisfac-
tion through prayer and fasting – and even to glory in it. Many measure 
their  fellowship  with  God  not  by  the  purity  of  their  hearts  but  by  how  
many hours they pray! That is the clearest proof that such people do not 
love God at all. Consider a young woman who claims to love a young man 
deeply.  Yet,  while  spending  time  with  him,  she  constantly  looks  at  her  
watch to see how much time has passed and is satisfied when finally an 
hour is up and then she says, “OK. I’ll go now”. That would clearly prove 
that  she  doesn’t  really  love  the  man  at  all.  If  she  really  loved  him,  she  
would say, “Forget time. I just want to be with my beloved.” It is the same 
when we spend time with our Beloved Lord. If you love the Lord, you will 
not be looking at your watch when you talk with Him. I have never done 
that in my whole life. Fellowship with God is a love relationship. 
Malachi  told  the  people,  “The  Lord  is  not  listening  to  your  prayers,  
because He has witnessed your unfaithfulness to your wife. You have 
not been true to the vows you made to her” (2:14). Preachers are in great 
danger,  because  they  stand  in  the  pulpit  so  much  and  certain  types  
of women can be attracted to them. Such women are religious women 
and not spiritual. Such a woman may come up to the preacher with a 
coy face and say, “Brother, I have a question for you.” All she wants is 
to get close to the preacher. I’ve had women come up to me like that 
after  I  have  preached  somewhere,  and  the  Lord  has  warned  me,  “Be  
careful now. This is the old serpent.” So, if the woman is married, I tell 
her,  “Sister,  go  and  ask  your  husband  that  question.”  But  she  will  
reply, “Brother, he is not a spiritual man.” She doesn’t realise that she 
herself is not spiritual but just religious. So I tell her, “Never mind if 
he is not spiritual. Ask him, for the Bible says, ‘Let a woman ask her 
husband at home’ (1 Corinthians 14:34, 35). If he cannot answer your 
question, then ask him to come and see me and I’ll explain it to him.” 
Most women get offended when they get a reply like that – and they 
never bother me again!
Do you want to protect yourself? Then follow that example.
But  some  preachers  actually  love  to  have  pretty  women  come  up  to  
them, tossing their heads and blinking their eyes and asking questions. 
Such preachers are the ones who finally fall into sin. If you want to keep 

God’s Servants and Marriage                                                                                                                  533
Malachi
from falling, keep such women at a distance. I am not saying you should 
not talk to women at all. But be careful of the flirtatious types. Watch 
how a woman is dressed and how she moves her head and her eyes – and 
you will be able to identify the flirtatious types quite easily.
You can be unfaithful to your wife even by the way you talk with other 
women. You may not touch a woman’s body and yet commit adultery in 
your heart. Nowadays, men and women work together in close proxim-
ity in offices. Test yourself by asking this question, “If your wife were to 
suddenly walk in to your office, would you have to stop all that laughing 
and joking with that other woman?” If so, there could be impurity in your 
conversation. 
There  is  a  lot  of  impurity  in  the  world  today  promoted  by  television,  
video tapes, filthy movies and cinema posters. And if we are not careful, 
this evil can get into our system. If you want to be a servant of God in 
these days, avoid all such temptations and be totally faithful to your wife. 
God  has  given  her  to  you  to  protect  you  from  temptation  (1  Corinthians  
7:1, 2).
Here the wife is called “the wife of your youth” (2:14). That means, that 
even when your wife is old and white-haired, you must see her the way 
she was when she was young and attractive. That’s the way I look at my 
wife. My wife has got gray hair. But I see her today just as I saw her on 
our wedding day – and she is just as pretty and attractive to me today as 
she was then. Be faithful to your wife. Don’t break your marriage vows. 
If you have slipped and fallen, repent deeply, and say, “Lord, I want to 
come back to you. I want to be totally faithful to You and to my wife in 
future.”
The  Lord  says  He  hates  divorce  (2:16).  Unfortunately,  divorce  has  
reared  its  ugly  head  even  in  evangelical  Christian  churches  –  espe-
cially in Western countries. And sadly, many churches endorse it. Even 
many of their pastors are divorced and remarried. I am not saying that 
divorced,  remarried  people  should  be  rejected.  They  may  have  been  
unconverted and without light when they did those things. We must 
now  lead  them  to  become  disciples  of  Jesus.  But  when  the  church  
itself conducts the marriages of divorced people, it is leading them into 
sin and disobedience to the teachings of Christ! Unfortunately, these 
influences are now corrupting many churches in India too. 
God  says,  “I  hate  divorce.  I  hate  the  violent  dismembering  of  the  ‘one  
flesh’ of marriage”  (2:16 -  MSG).  So,  if  you  are  a  servant  of  God  you  
will  hate  divorce  too  and  you  will  proclaim  everywhere  that  God  hates  
divorce.  “If  a  man  does  not  live  in  an  understanding  way  with  his  wife,  
God will not listen to his prayers” (1 Peter 3:7).
In India, most husbands do not respect their wives. They do not recog-
nise their wives as “fellow-heirs of the grace of life”. One proof of this is 

534 Through the Bible: Form Without Power
Malachi
that they don’t share spiritual matters with them or pray with them. They 
pray mostly only with other brothers.
The  way  you  bring  up  your  children  is  also  important.  Why  did  the  
Lord make you one with your wife? “Didn’t God make you one body and 
spirit  with  her  (your  wife)?  What  was  his  purpose  in  this?  It  was  that  
you should have children who are truly God’s people” (2:15 - TEV). 
It is easy to produce children. But to raise them up as godly young men 
and women is the task of a lifetime. So be loyal to your wife and work 
together with her to raise a godly family. Seek God with all your heart for 
His help to raise your children in a godly way. After many years of having 
observed  the  waywardness  of  the  children  of  many  preachers,  I  have  
developed the highest respect for those preachers who have brought up 
their children in a godly way. Godly children are a tremendous testimony 
in a godless age. I am not saying that a preacher’s children should all be 
preachers. Preaching is a calling from God – and no man can give that 
calling to His children. God Himself has to call them. What I am talking 
about  is  Christlike  character.  Our  character  is  a  million  times  more  
important than our ministry. Many preachers today promote their child-
ren into their ministry. But there is no precedent for this in Scripture. 
If the children are anointed and called by God then that is all right, but 
not otherwise.
In 3:1, the Lord says, “Behold, I am going to send My messenger (John 
the Baptist), and he will clear the way before Me. And the Lord (Christ), 
whom  you  seek,  will  suddenly  come  to  His  temple;  and  the  Messenger  
of the covenant, in whom you delight, behold, He is coming.” The proph-
ecy goes on to say that the Lord will come into His church (temple) like 
a blazing fire to refine everyone. He will sit  down to refine the people, 
because this is going to take a long time (3:3). We stand for jobs that we 
can finish quickly. But we sit, when we know that the work is going to 
take a long time. The Lord refines until all the dross of worldliness and 
sin is burned away from our lives. Thus the Lord purifies His servants, 
refining them as gold. And He will stop only when that gold is so pure 
that He can see His face reflected in it – when the likeness of Christ is 
seen in us. Until then we have to be refined. This is the work of a lifetime.
In 1 John 3:3, we are told that everyone who has the hope of the second 
coming of Christ will purify himself as Christ Himself is pure. Our calling 
is to cooperate with the Lord as He puts us into the fire and burns away 
the dross. The fire is formed by the difficult circumstances, trials, sick-
nesses and other thorns in the flesh that the Lord permits Satan to send 
our way. God may allow us to lose money and property in order to free 
us from the dross of the love of money. He may allow people to accuse us 
falsely and to ride over our heads to deliver us from the dross of seeking 
man’s  honour.  His  ultimate  purpose  is  that  we  become  like  Christ  in  

God’s Servants and Money                                                                                                                     535
Malachi
every area. Only then will we be able to offer Him a pure sacrifice. If you 
allow the Lord to take you through the fires of testing, persecution, tribu-
lation, trial, misunderstanding, false accusation, etc. and you respond in 
each of those with submission to God and love to your persecutors, then 
you will be so pure that when you give God’s Word to others, there will 
be a rich anointing on your words and the power of God in your ministry. 
You won’t be merely repeating what you heard others preach. Your words 
will come from your life. That is the type of ministry God wants all of us 
to have. That is the pure offering that He is seeking.
“I,  the  LORD,  do  not  change;  therefore  you,  O  sons  of  Jacob,  are  not  
consumed” (3:6). This verse is found at the close of the Old Testament to 
correct the false views of those who imagine that the God described in 
the New Testament is a gentler God than the One in the Old Testament. 
That is just not true. And so, in the last page of the Old Testament, God 
emphasises that He is unchanging. He hates sin today just as much as 
He did in Old Testament times; and He was just as merciful and compas-
sionate then, as He is now. He has not changed – and He never will.
God’s Servants and Money
The  Lord  says, “Will  a  man  rob  [or  cheat]  God?  Yet  you  are  robbing  Me!  
But you say, ‘How have we robbed You?’ In tithes and offerings. You are 
cursed with a curse, for you are robbing [defrauding] Me, the whole nation 
of you! Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food 
in My house, and test Me now in this, if I will not open for you the windows 
of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until there is not room enough. 
Then I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits 
of the ground; nor will your vine in the field cast its grapes” (3:8–11).
Did  you  know  that  tithing is  not  mentioned  even  once,  after  the  day  
of  Pentecost  (when  the  new  covenant  was  instituted)?  Tithing  is  not  
commanded under the new covenant at all – yet multitudes of covetous 
pastors still preach it today and exploit poor, ignorant believers. Jesus 
did not teach His disciples to tithe but to give. What do we have to give 
to God first of all? Romans 12:1 states, “I beseech you, brethren, by the 
mercies of God, present your bodies (not your tithes) as a living sacrifice 
to God.”
Just  as  paying  the  tithe  was  emphasised  under  the  old  covenant,  
presenting  our  bodies  to  God  is  what  is  emphasised  in  the  new  cove-
nant. Tithing was meant to be a type, just like the Passover lamb and the 
Sabbath day. The lamb was a type of Christ, and the Sabbath was a type 
of the inward rest that Christ gives us. These Old Testament rituals were 
all shadows of what was finally fulfilled in Christ (as Colossians 2:16, 17 
makes crystal clear).

536 Through the Bible: Form Without Power
Malachi
Concerning  tithing,  God  had  said,  “The  purpose  of  tithing  is  to  teach  
you always to put God first in your lives” (Deuteronomy 14:23 - LB). Under 
the old covenant, they offered their tithes to prove that God was first in 
their lives. In the new covenant, we present our bodies to God and thus 
prove that He is first in our lives. 
What  does  it  mean  to  offer  our  bodies?  It  means  giving  our  eyes  to  
God so that we never use them for ourselves again. Is that easier or is it 
easier to give 10% of your income to God? You know that it is far easier 
to give 10% of our income each month to God than to keep our eyes pure 
each day of that month. That is why preachers teach tithing more than 
keeping our eyes pure. Many pastors are lovers of money and they want 
their congregation to tithe so that they can become rich from those tithes. 
Since there is no justification at all for tithing in the new covenant, they 
use this verse in Malachi to frighten ignorant believers into paying their 
tithes every month. 
The early apostles were poor, as we can see clearly from 1 Corinthians 
4:9–12: “God has exhibited us apostles last of all.... To this present hour 
we are both hungry and thirsty, and are poorly clothed, and are roughly 
treated,  and  are  homeless;  and  we  toil,  working  with  our  own  hands.” 
But consider the mathematics of how a covetous pastor today becomes 
wealthy.  If  10  people  give  him  one-tenth  of  their  income,  he  gets  one  
man’s average salary (because 10 × 10% = 100%). This is reasonable. But 
well-known pastors receive tithes from hundreds of God’s people. If even 
100 people give their tithes to a pastor, his income will become ten times 
that of the average man – and very soon he will become a millionaire, at 
the expense of his supporters! And then in order to justify his becoming 
wealthy, he will begin to preach prosperity as the mark of God’s blessing 
(from  the  Old  Testament  –  Deuteronomy  28:5,  8,  11) – and his flock is 
deceived. This is the deception flooding Christendom today, all over the 
world, and it is all being done in the Name of Jesus. The money-changers 
are back in the temple of God – and there is no-one to drive them out, as 
Jesus did; and there is hardly any preacher who is bold enough to expose 
these confidence tricksters.
Then how much money should we to give for God’s work? Only what 
we  can  give  cheerfully  –  for  God  does not  love  those  who  give  money  
under  pressure,  or  who  give  in  order  to  get  something  from  Him  (See  
2 Corinthians 9:7). First give your body to the Lord and then give what-
ever money you want to give cheerfully, but never as an obligation and 
certainly not out of fear. I hope this understanding of God’s Word liber-
ates you from false teaching.
The Remnant in the Last Days
In 3:16, we see some characteristics of God’s remnant of the last-days. 
They fear God. They are careful with their speech. They are concerned 

The Remnant in the Last Days                                                                                                                537
Malachi
about the glory of God’s name. And the Lord puts their names down in a 
book called the Book of Remembrance. This is not the Book of Life which 
has the names of all those who are born again. This book contains only 
the names of those who reverence God, who love to think about Him, who 
are concerned about His name and who speak to each other about the 
Lord. No gossiper’s name or backbiter’s name is found in this book. My 
guess is that this book contains less than 5% of the names found in the 
Book of Life!! The Lord says that these saints will be His special treasure. 
One day He will reveal them to the world – and only in that day will we 
see who really served God and who pretended to be His servants but in 
fact sought their own.
Chapter  4 tells us of the day of judgement that is coming. The first 
people to be judged will be the proud. “All the arrogant and every evildoer 
will be chaff and the day that is coming will set them ablaze, so that it will 
leave them neither root nor branch” (4:1). See how God hates pride. 
And then the Lord says, “But for you who revere My name, the Sun of 
Righteousness will arise with healing in His wings; and you will tread 
down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on 
the day which I am preparing” (4:2, 3). When Christ returns, Satan will 
finally be crushed under our feet (Romans 16:20).
Malachi finally prophesied that the Lord would send “Elijah the prophet 
before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD” (4:5). John 
the Baptist came to Israel “in this spirit of Elijah” (Luke 1:17). But Jesus 
told the Jews of his day that John would be the prophesied “Elijah” only if 
they accepted John and his message (Matthew 11:14). But Israel did not 
accept John. And so he was not the prophesied Elijah. As we approach 
the  last  days  now,  God  will  send  an  Elijah-ministry  to  the  world.  This  
will  not  be  through  any  single  individual  (as  in  Old  Testament  times),  
but by the last-days “Body of Christ”. The church and its ministers have 
to go forth now in the spirit of Elijah and proclaim (as Elijah proclaimed 
on Mount Carmel), “You cannot serve two masters. If Christ is your God 
serve Him. If Mammon (money and wealth) is your god, then serve it. But 
you cannot serve both.” 
Malachi’s final statement is that Elijah “will  restore  the  hearts  of  the  
fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers”, 
so that the Lord does not smite the land with a curse (4:6).
In the book of Zechariah, we saw a prophecy that the generation gap 
between parents and children would be broken and parents would be 
in  glorious  fellowship  with  their  children.  We  see  a  similar  prophecy  
here. This is God’s will and this is what the church must emphasise 

538 Through the Bible: Form Without Power
Malachi
in  these  last  days.  We  must  build  family  relationships,  emphasise  
home-values  and  bring  fathers  and  children  closer  together.  Cults  
separate children from their parents and break up homes. Here it says 
that God will curse all who do that. God wants to bring parents and 
children together in these last days.
It is significant that the last word in the Old Testament is ‘curse’. Christ 
became a curse for us so that that curse is removed (Galatians 3:13). And 
so, the last phrase in the New Testament is “the grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ  be  with  you”  (Revelation  22:21). The  curse  on  the  earth  will  be  
totally lifted when Christ returns.
Today we are called to prepare people for the coming of the Lord.

THE NEW 
TESTAMENT



MATTHEW
Jesus Christ –  
The Promised Messiah
W
e now come to the New Testament. The very first thing we read 
here is the genealogy of Christ. It doesn’t go all the way to Adam 
(as in Luke 3:23–38). Here it goes only as far as Abraham. Jesus 
is  called  the  Son  of  David  and  the  Son  of  Abraham  –  indicating  that  
Matthew  was  writing  his  gospel  primarily  for  the  Jewish  people  of  his  
time,  seeking  to  convince  them  that  Jesus  was  the  promised  Messiah.  
That’s why there are more than 40 quotations from the Old Testament 
here to prove that Jesus was the Messiah. There are altogether about 53 
quotations from the Old Testament in Matthew.
The Kingdom of Heaven and the Church 
We see a phrase in this gospel that does not occur anywhere else – “the 
kingdom  of  heaven.”  It  occurs  31  times  in  this  gospel.  Since  the  Holy  
Spirit inspired this book, there must have been a reason why He used 
this  phrase  so  often  here.  John  the  Baptist  came  preaching,  saying,  
“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (3:2). After his time, Jesus 
preached exactly the same message in 4:17. When He began the sermon 
on the mount, the very first words He said were, “Blessed are the poor in 
spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven” (5:3). So we see an emphasis 
on “heaven” right from the beginning of the New Testament. “Heaven” is 
mentioned 17 times in the sermon on the mount alone.
The  old  covenant  which  God  made  with  Israel  related  to  a  kingdom  
on this earth. Israel was given Canaan’s land and promised material 
prosperity, physical healing and other earthly benefits. Later, they had 
an earthly king, earthly riches and other earthly blessings. But Jesus 

542 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
came to lift man to another realm altogether – to heaven. So when we 
read the New Testament, we must remember that the good news here 
is primarily about heaven and not about this earth. If we understand 
this, it will save us from much of the confusion found in Christendom 
today.
We say we are “saved”. That is a very common expression among believ-
ers,  But  what  are  we  “saved”  from?  Have  we  been  saved  from  earthly  
ways, or have we just had our sins forgiven? Have we been saved from 
an interest in earthly things, from an earthly way of viewing people and 
circumstances, and from earthly ways of behaving? 
The new covenant is the gospel of the kingdom of heaven.
Many  people  around  the  world  are  eager  to  become  citizens  of  the  
United States of America, because the USA is a very attractive place to 
live  in.  But  nobody  would  be  interested  in  becoming  citizens  of  some  
backward  country  in  Africa.  Why  is  it  then  that  so  few  in  this  world  
are  interested  in  becoming  citizens  of  the  most  attractive  place  of  all  
– heaven? Because they have not seen the real glory of heavenly citizen-
ship. And this is because the gospel has not been preached properly. And 
so we find a multitude of “so-called believers” sitting in the church who 
are not interested in the kingdom of heaven. They want to go to heaven 
when they die, but they don’t want the kingdom of heaven now.
The  word  ‘kingdom’  is  not  a  word  that  we  understand  clearly  today,  
because we have very few kings ruling kingdoms now, unlike as in the 
first century. The equivalent word we use today is ‘government’. We speak 
of the ‘government of India’ and not the ‘kingdom of India’.
That’s what the kingdom of heaven means – the government of heaven. 
It means God governing your life. When you live in India, you have to live 
under the rules of the Government of India. If you come into the govern-
ment  of  heaven,  you  have  to  live  under  the  rules  of  the  government  of  
heaven. Have you changed your citizenship from earth to heaven? 
Salvation means being saved from the kingdom of earth to the kingdom 
of  heaven.  But  the  salvation  of  many  believers  has  not  gone  that  far.  
They want to go to heaven when they die. But they don’t want the rule 
of heaven in their lives now. They want to live now as full citizens of this 
earth. That is why their Christian life is so shallow.
There  is  yet  another  word  used  in  Matthew  that  is  not  found  in  any  
other  gospel.  It  is  the  word  ‘church.’  It  occurs  thrice  –  once  in  16:18 
and  twice  in  18:17.  Put  this  word  alongside  the  phrase  we  have  been  
considering, and we will see that the church is meant to be the kingdom 
of heaven on earth. In heaven everybody lives under the government of 
heaven, the rule of God. But here on earth it is different. Everyone runs 
his own life. In the midst of such people, God has a group of people who 
do  not  run  their  own  lives.  They  are  under  the  government  of  heaven.  
That is the church.

The Birth of Jesus                                                                                                                                      543
Matthew
Are  the  churches  in  the  world  living  under  the  absolute  authority  of  
the  government  of  heaven?  No.  This  has  grieved  my  heart  for  many  
years. I hope it grieves your heart too. I am not blaming others. I am 
not saying ‘They are like that’. I am saying, ‘We are like that.’ We are the 
church and we have failed to show the world the blessedness of living 
under the rule of heaven. And so I pray, “Lord, forgive us for our failure. 
Help us to show the world what it means to live under the rule of God.”
Matthew shows us in his gospel how the Ruler of this government of 
heaven lived on earth and what He taught. Matthew’s emphasis is more 
on what He taught than on what He did.
There  are  more  parables  of  Jesus  in  this  gospel  than  in  any  other  
gospel. Chapter 13 is full of parables of the kingdom of heaven. Chapter 23 
deals entirely with religious hypocrites – the Pharisees. Jesus’ ministry 
brought Him into constant confrontation with the Pharisees. There are 
more  confrontations  with  the  Pharisees  described  in  Matthew  than  in  
any of the other gospels. Chapters 24 and 25 deal with the kingdom of 
heaven being established on earth, when Christ returns. Chapters 5, 6 
and 7 deal with the principles of the kingdom of heaven, teaching us how 
the members of this kingdom are to live on earth.
This book can be divided into three parts: Chapters 1 and 2 are about 
the birth of Jesus. Chapters 3 to 18 are about His ministry in Galilee. And 
Chapters 19 to 28 are about His ministry in Judea.
The Birth of Jesus
Chapter 1 gives the genealogy of Jesus Christ. The Jews mentioned the 
names of men only in their genealogies. However, here we find four women 
mentioned as well – teaching us that Jesus had come to raise the level of 
women from the low position that Jewish and heathen society had given 
them. Further, these four women had a sinful history, teaching us that 
Jesus came to save the worst of sinners.
The  first  woman  mentioned  is  Tamar  (1:3).  Tamar  was  Judah’s  
  daughter-in-law  through  whom  Judah  had  a  son  Perez,  who  was  an  
ancestor of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Jesus was in heaven when this 
incest  took  place  (Genesis  38:12–29),  and  decided  that  this  sinful  line  
would be his earthly family-line. How many of us would choose such a 
sinful family-line and have an incestuous relationship mentioned on the 
very first page of our biography?
The  second  woman  mentioned  here  is  Rahab  (1:5),  who  was  a  well-
known prostitute in the “red-light” district of Jericho (Joshua 2:1). A Jewish 
man  name  Salmon  married  this  Gentile.  Jesus  saw  this  marriage  of  a  
Jew with a Gentile prostitute from heaven – and decided to come through 
that line.
The  third  woman  is  Ruth  (1:5).  Ruth  was  a  Moabitess.  Her  ances-
tor was Moab, who was born through Lot’s adultery with his daughter 

544 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
(Genesis 19:30–37). Once again, Jesus saw this incest from heaven, and 
Ruth descending from this incest, and decided to choose that line.
The  fourth  woman  is  Bathsheba  –  the  wife  of  Uriah  (1:6).  She  was  
the  woman  with  whom  David  committed  adultery  and  whom  he  later  
married. Once again, we have a woman whose history is one of sin. She 
was not the ancestor of Mary as the first three women were. She was the 
ancestor  of  Joseph.  (We  can  see  that  when  we  compare  this  genealogy  
with  the  genealogy  of  Mary  in  Luke  3).  Joseph  was  of  the  royal  line  of  
David, and Matthew was proving through this genealogy that Jesus was 
rightfully the true king of Israel.
Why did Jesus choose such a sinful family-line? To show His identifi-
cation with the race of sinful men and to make it manifest that He had 
come, not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. 
So we see that no-one needs to be ashamed of his/her family line. In 
India, people boast about their family-tree. When a Christian does that, 
he shows thereby that he has not understood the Spirit of Christ at all.
When Joseph heard about Mary being pregnant, and not knowing that 
this was a supernatural work of God in her womb, it says that since he 
was a righteous man, he did not want to disgrace her but wanted to cover 
what he thought was her sin (1:19).
There  is  something  we  can  all  learn  here  about  righteousness.  The  
message  of  the  gospel  is  essentially  how  an  unrighteous  man  can  
become righteous. The first person to be called a righteous man in 
the New Testament is Joseph. And his righteousness is mentioned in 
connection with wanting to cover another person’s sin and not shame 
that person. This is the spirit of a truly righteous man.
When  you  hear  that  somebody  has  sinned,  what  is  your  immediate  
reaction? If you are a righteous man, you will want to cover it. If you are 
an unrighteous man, you will talk about it to others. There we see that 
Joseph,  who  did  not  have  the  Holy  Spirit  and  was  not  under  the  new  
covenant, was far more righteous than millions of believers who claim to 
be born again. With the standards of the old covenant, Joseph decided to 
cover what he thought was sin. Thank God he never scandalised Mary. 
For  if  he  had,  can  you  imagine  the  regret  and  remorse  he  would  have  
had, when he discovered the truth – that that she was 100% pure and 
innocent!! These things are written for our instruction.
How can you take back stories that you have circulated about others 
if you later discover them to be false. For the one you told them to would 
have circulated it further to perhaps ten other people who in turn would 
have  spread  it  even  further.  So  here  is  a  warning  and  an  example  for  
us from the very first chapter of the New Testament. Cover the sins of 
others. Learn from Joseph’s example. Love covers a multitude of sins. 
In 1:21, we read the very first promise in the New Testament: “He shall 
save His people from their sins”. This is the meaning of the name, “Jesus”. 

The Birth of Jesus                                                                                                                                      545
Matthew
This  is  not  a  promise  that  Jesus  would  forgive  our  sins,  but  that  He  
would save us from our sins. Forgiveness is merely the removal of the 
guilt of our past sins. To be saved from sin is to be saved from anger, the 
lust of the eyes, covetousness, bitterness, jealousy, etc. It means that He 
will save us from being enslaved to sin.
The second promise in the New Testament is found in 3:11: “He shall 
baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.”
These are the first two promises in the New Testament – and in these, 
the message of the gospel is summed up. We need to experience the fulfil-
ment of both these promises. We need to be saved from our sins and we 
need to be baptised in the Holy Spirit and fire.
In Chapter 2, we read about the wise men who came to see the newborn 
Jesus. We read there of one foolish thing that those wise men did – and 
that is a warning to all of us. Even wise men do foolish things at times! 
They had followed the star for many hundreds of miles from their eastern 
lands all the way up to Jerusalem. That star is a picture of the word of 
God  that  leads  us  always  to  Jesus.  But  once  they  reached  Jerusalem,  
where the king’s palace was located, they became foolish. They assumed 
that the King of the Jews would naturally be born in the palace – and 
they stopped following the star. So they went to King Herod’s palace to 
see the newborn king!! But the people in the palace knew nothing about 
any newborn king. So those wise men had to come outside and follow the 
star once again (2:10).
The star finally led them, not to a palace but to a little hut – and the 
King was there. If you follow the Word of God, it will always lead you to 
Jesus. Even today, God can lead you to a church where Jesus is found. 
He won’t be found in the palaces of the high and the mighty, but in the 
simple dwellings of those who love Him and want to follow Him. 
But see what great harm these wise men did to hundreds of people by 
their one mistake. Because they told Herod about the birth of a king, he 
sent soldiers to Bethlehem who massacred all the baby boys that were 
under two years of age there. When we do not obey God’s Word, a single 
act of foolishness of ours can cause much harm to many others.
An angel then spoke to those wise men in a dream and told them not 
to go back to Herod, but to go back home by another route. Thank God 
they obeyed the angel this time!! Joseph also was led by a dream to go to 
Egypt, and later by another dream to return to Israel. Guidance through 
dreams occurs a number of times in the first two chapters of the New 
Testament. God guides thus, occasionally, today too.
In Chapter 3, we come to the ministry of John the Baptist. The word 
‘baptism’ is a word that was introduced into the English language by the 
translators of the King James Version of the Bible (KJV) in 1611. History 
tells  us  that  when  King  James  of  England  ordered  this  translation,  he  
gave certain rules to the translators, one of which was that they should 
not disturb existing church traditions. In the Anglican churches of those 

546 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
days,  they  used  to  sprinkle  water  on  newborn  babies  and  “christen” 
them. When the translators came to this Greek word ‘baptizo’ (or ‘bapto’) 
in Chapter  3  here,  they  faced  a  dilemma.  The  word  meant  “immerse” 
in  Greek  and  that  is  how  they  should  have  translated  it.  If  they  had  
been honest and done that, we would never have heard of baptism or of 
Baptists! But they realised that if they translated it accurately, it would 
disturb  the  existing  church  tradition  of  christening  –  and  they  did  not  
want to be beheaded by King James! At the same time, they could not, in 
all honesty, translate the word as “christen” or “sprinkle”. So they (very 
cleverly)  introduced  a  new  word  into  the  English  language  –  ‘baptism.’ 
(This was somewhat like the way Indian words such as ‘dhobi’ and ‘Sahib’ 
were introduced into the English language). When the common people of 
those  days  read  this  new  translation  and  read  the  word  ‘baptism’  they  
didn’t know what it meant, for it was a totally new word. So they assumed 
that this must be what the priests do to newborn children in the Anglican 
church. Thus christening came to be known as ‘baptism’.
The  correct  translation  for  ‘John  the  Baptist’  would  be  ‘John  the  
Immerser.’ But I have never found a single translation of the Bible that 
has had the courage to translate that Greek word accurately, because if 
they did, the millions of “Christians” who practice child baptism would 
not  buy  it.  So  we  see  that  even  the  best  Bible  translations  today  are  
determined by economic factors and not by truth alone! 
When Jesus came to John for baptism, John said, “I can’t baptise You. 
You  need  to  baptise  me.”  Jesus  did  not  need  to  be  baptised  –  because  
John’s  baptism  was  for  those  who  had  repented  from  their  sins,  and  
Jesus  had  never  sinned  at  any  time,  consciously  or  unconsciously.  He  
was born holy and did not have a sinful nature as we have. Why then did 
He stand in line with the people who were getting baptised? He looked just 
like any other Jewish carpenter and nobody but John knew who He was. 
Many reasonings could have entered Jesus’ mind at that time, such as: 
“People will misunderstand You if You get baptised. They will think that 
You have committed some sins that you are repenting of now. Your testi-
mony will be affected,” etc. But He would not listen to such reasonings. 
He had heard His Father tell Him to identify Himself with the sinners who 
were getting baptised – even though He had never sinned. And He obeyed 
His Father. 
We don’t like to be identified with sinners! We look down on others who 
we think are greater sinners than we are. And that’s why our ministry is so 
limited and so shallow. Jesus identified Himself with sinners totally, even 
though there was not a spot of sin in Him. Let us humble ourselves and 
follow His example. We are not better than anyone else. And our group is 
not better than any other. May God have mercy on us if we think otherwise.
Jesus told John, “You have to baptise Me because that is the only way 
I can fulfil all righteousness.” Righteousness, for Jesus meant doing the 
will of His Father, whatever it was.

The Three Temptations                                                                                                                            547
Matthew
The Three Temptations
In 4:1–11,  we  read  about  the  temptation  of  Jesus.  The  Bible  says  in  
Hebrews 4:15 that Jesus “was tempted in every point exactly like us, but 
did not sin”. Some “clever” Christians seek to analyse this and ask the 
question. “Could Jesus have sinned or was it impossible for Him to sin?” 
Some say “He was not able to sin”, while others say, “He was able not to 
sin”. But we don’t have to get involved in this discussion at all. We find 
it difficult to analyse the psychology of ordinary men. How then can we 
analyse the psychology of Jesus? It is enough for us to know that He was 
tempted just like we are and did not sin. And in that, He is an example for 
us. We know He was God and we also know that He did not use His abil-
ities as God when He came to earth as a man. God cannot be tempted, 
but Jesus was tempted. I believe exactly what the Bible says that He was 
tempted exactly like we are, and did not sin. This is what gives me the 
faith that I too can overcome as He overcame (Revelation 3:21).
Jesus was tempted by the devil for 40 days (Luke 4:2). He resisted the 
devil for all those 40 days. What we read here is just the last three temp-
tations.  Jesus  overcame  each  temptation  with  the  sword  of  the  Spirit  
– “It is written.” When the devil saw that Jesus quoted the Word, he also 
quoted  a  Scripture  and  said,  “It  is  written  that  He  will  give  His  angels  
charge over You. So jump down from the top of the temple” (4:6). To that 
Jesus  replied,  “It  is  also  written  that  you  shall  not  tempt  the  Lord  your  
God”  (4:7). The  whole  truth  is  not  found  in  one  Scripture  alone  but  in  
the whole of the Scriptures – one verse balanced out by another verse. If 
Satan could quote Scripture to try and lead Jesus into sin, you can be 
certain that He will quote Scripture to lead you astray as well. And if you 
don’t know the Scriptures well, you will be led astray. Jesus had a word 
from Scripture to resist each temptation that Satan brought against Him. 
It is good to see what was inherent in the temptations Jesus faced, for 
Satan tempts us in the same way too.
1. Selfishness (4:1–4). Turn the stones into bread to satisfy your hunger.
a. Place  your  physical  needs  above  your  spiritual  needs.  Jesus  
replied  that  man  has  to  live  by  every  word  that  proceeds  from  
God’s mouth and not merely by bread.
b. Use  the  power  God  has  given  you  for  your  own  personal  gain.  
Jesus refused to do so. He would use this power to multiply bread 
for  5000  men  later,  but  never  for  Himself.  Many  preachers  have  
fallen a prey to this temptation, by using the power and gift God 
gave them to make money for themselves. 
2. Presumption (4:5–7). Jump off the temple-roof and claim God’s promi-
ses for protection.
a. Take a step that God has not told you to take – and claim God’s 
promises.  Jesus  replied  that  we  should  not  tempt  God  by  doing  
risky  things.  Some  foolish  Christians  when  they  are  sick,  won‘t  

548 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
take medicines but expect God to heal them supernaturally. That 
is  not  faith  but  presumption.  It  is  suicide!  Medicines  are  made  
from God’s creation and we should use them. If there is a stair-
case coming down from the temple-roof, we should use that and 
not jump down!! God will not protect us if we jump. If, however, we 
are in a jungle where medicines are not available, then we can ask 
God to heal us without medicines, and He will heal us – but not 
when He has provided medicines.
b. Do something spectacular to show others that you are a man of 
God. A temptation to seek man’s honour. Jesus refused to do spec-
tacular things and miracles, for man’s honour.
3. Compromise (4:8–10). Get the kingdoms of the world and their glory by 
bowing to Satan.
a. Get a right thing in a wrong way – by an unrighteous shortcut! An 
unrighteous action amounts to bowing to Satan. Jesus chose the 
long arduous way of the Cross and refused all short-cuts.
b. Pursue after the glory this world offers – money and honour, posi-
tion  and  power  (in  the  world  or  in  the  church).  Jesus  said  that  
only God was to be worshipped, not Satan or money or anything 
else that he offers. Many preachers seek for a wider ministry by 
keeping silent about some things (that God wants them to preach 
about) and thus pleasing everybody. They do get a wider ministry 
thus – but it is by bowing the knee to Satan. 
Satan comes to us in all these ways, just like he came to Jesus. Jesus 
drove him away with a word of God, and we can drive him away with a 
word of God too.
The Sermon on the Mount
In Chapters 5, 6 and 7 we read the sermon on the mount. Jesus began 
that  sermon  by  saying,  “Blessed  are  the  poor  in  spirit  for  theirs  is  the  
kingdom  of  heaven”  (5:3). The  primary  requirement  for  entering  the  
kingdom of heaven is poverty of spirit. That is the master key that opens 
every door in this palace called “the kingdom of heaven”. All the riches of 
heaven can be ours if we have this master key.
What  does  it  mean  to  be  poor  in  spirit?  As  an  illustration,  consider  
what  it  means  to  be  poor  materially.  Think  of  a  beggar  who  comes  to  
your gate one day – and you give him a few rupees. He will come back 
again the next day, and the next day, and the next day – forever. Why? 
Because he is perpetually in need. He is always aware of his need, and he 
is humble enough to keep coming to your gate unashamedly, and to beg 
for more money – because he knows you are a generous man.
This is what it means to be poor in spirit too. We go to God and say, 
“Lord, I am a needy person spiritually. If You don’t give me what I need, 

The Sermon on the Mount                                                                                                                      549
Matthew
I  won’t  understand  anything  in  Your  Word  and  I’ll  be  defeated  by  sin  
today.”  The  next  day  we  are  back  at  the  Lord’s  door  again  begging  for  
more. And the next day, and the next day – perpetually. Because we are 
constantly aware of our need. Jesus said that such people would possess 
the  entire  kingdom  of  heaven.  If  you  want  to  possess  the  kingdom  of  
heaven, keep this attitude all your life.
When  God  uses  you  mightily  to  bring  many  to  Christ  and  to  build  
churches, don’t forget to remain poor in spirit. Keep going back to God 
again and again and say, “Lord, I am poor. Give me power. Teach me. Give 
me the fullness of Your Spirit. Give me love for people. Give me purity....” 
It  is  such  “needy  spiritual beggars”  who  become  holy  and  whom  God  
uses mightily. It is such “beggars” who become spiritually rich and get 
God’s best. To beg from men may be humiliating, but to beg from God is 
the most spiritual thing you can do. God has already made me quite rich 
spiritually. But I know He has got more to give me, and I want all that He 
has. Let me encourage you to be this type of ‘beggar’ forever.
“Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God” (5:8). A pure heart 
is  different  from  a  clean  conscience.  A  clear  conscience  only  means  a  
heart that is free from all known sin – where every sin has been confessed 
and cleansed. A pure heart, however, is a heart that is free from all things 
and  has  place  only  for  God.  A  man  can  have  a  good  conscience  and  
still have many lawful things in his heart other than God. He may have 
worldly ambitions, even though his conscience is clear. But a man with 
a  pure  heart  has  only  one  ambition  –  to  please  God.  His  whole  heart  
belongs to God.
When your heart is pure, you will see God – everywhere. You will see 
God  in  your  circumstances,  when  people  help  you  and  when  people  
curse you and harm you (as David saw God when Shimei cursed him). 
When your heart is not pure, however, you will only see the people who 
are troubling you, perhaps your difficult wife or husband or neighbour. 
A person with an impure heart has many problems. But one with a pure 
heart,  Jesus  said,  would  be  blessed,  because  he  sees  only  God  every-
where and in everything!
The Lord’s main emphasis in 5:20 to 6:18 was on the inner life. The 
righteousness of the Pharisees was on the outside, and our righteousness 
is to exceed that (5:20). True holiness begins on the inside. It is quality 
the Lord seeks in righteousness, not quantity. The quality of our right-
eousness  must  be  fundamentally  different  than  that  of  the  Pharisees. 
They had an earthly righteousness that was outward and brought them 
honour  from  men.  But  in  the  kingdom  of  heaven,  the  important  thing  
is the inner life. Everything in our lives must flow from within us. Our 
freedom from murder and adultery must be on the inside (5:21–30), for 
the kingdom of heaven is within us.
In 6:1–18,  Jesus  spoke  about  practising  our  giving,  our  praying  and  
our fasting before God alone. Consider first the matter of fasting. Most of 

550 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
the Christians I have met in India who fast, invariably talk about it. Jesus 
gave only one command about fasting – “When you fast, don’t tell anyone 
about it” – and that is what they disobey. God gave only one command 
to Adam – and he disobeyed that. God has given only one command to 
children – “Obey your parents” – and they disobey that. We find the same 
disobedience among most of those who fast. Let us now raise up another 
generation of Christians who will fast and pray and give – but who will 
never tell anyone about these actions. There is a great lust within us to 
get honour when we do these things and that is why we talk about it. But 
the Lord says that thereby we will lose our reward in heaven. We will lose 
our anointing on earth too.
While  Jesus  warned  us  in  Chapter  7,  not  to  judge  others,  He  also  
warned us to discern “false prophets who come in sheep’s clothing” (7:15). 
The sheep’s clothing refers to correct evangelical doctrine. A false prophet 
may have the correct doctrine, but he will be a wolf inside. Wolves are 
only interested in devouring the sheep. False prophets are out to exploit 
simple believers for their own gain. If you listen to his doctrine alone, you 
will think he is a sheep or even a shepherd!! But if he seeks to exploit you 
financially or to control you in some way, he is a wolf. Such a man is only 
out to gain something for himself in the name of Christ – your money or 
your submission.
Unfortunately, the understanding of many today is that a false prophet 
is one whose doctrine is wrong. Jesus however said that the way to detect 
false prophets was not by their doctrine, or by the results of their minis-
try, but by the lack of the fruit of the Spirit in their character (7:16). We 
must not be deceived by a preacher’s gifts – even by supernatural gifts. 
Ask yourself, “Does he have the Spirit of Christ? Is he a humble brother? 
Is he free from the love of money? Does he ask people for money? Does 
he emphasise holiness in his preaching? Is he pure in his relationships 
with  women?  Are  his  children  and  closest  co-workers  godly?”  It  is  by  
asking these questions that God has protected me from being deceived 
by false prophets. Many in Christendom are deceived because they eval-
uate preachers merely by their doctrine.
After  talking  about  the  fruit  of  the  Spirit  throughout  the  sermon  on  
the mount, Jesus finally spoke about the gifts of the Spirit. He said that 
in the final day, many  would  come  to  Him  and  say,  “Lord,  we  prophe-
sied in Your name, we cast out demons in Your name, we did miracles in 
Your name,” etc. (7:22). And the Lord will say to them, “Depart from Me, 
because you lived in sin.” They preached to others, cast out demons, and 
even did miracles in Jesus’ Name, but they still went to hell!
When  you  look  at  a  modern-day  “healing  crusade”  being  conducted  
under the floodlights, with hundreds of thousands of people in attend-
ance,  and  the  correct  doctrine  being  preached,  how  many  of  you  have  
thought of this warning of Jesus and considered the possibility that the 
preacher may go to hell finally? My guess is that 99.9% of believers would 

Appreciation and Encouragement                                                                                                         551
Matthew
never consider that as a possibility. In spite of Jesus’ clear warning, most 
believers still evaluate a preacher by his gifts and not by his character. 
We  must  never  allow  ourselves  to  be  impressed  by  anyone’s  prophetic  
gifts or by his casting out demons or doing miracles.
May those who have ears to hear, hear. I have preached this truth for 
many years now, but I still find very, very few believers who believe what 
Jesus said. This is because our pride makes us trust in our own judge-
ment rather than in Jesus’ warnings. “Let God be true and every man a 
liar” (Romans 3:4).
Consider now the reverse scenario to what Jesus said. Suppose, in the 
day of judgement, a believer were to say, “Lord, by Your grace my sins 
were forgiven. And by Your grace I lived an overcoming life. But I never 
prophesied or healed the sick or cast out any demons.” Will the Lord say 
to him, “Depart from me, you who never did miracles and never cast out 
demons”? No. That is impossible.
If you have gifts without fruit, you can end up in hell. But if you have 
fruit  without  gifts,  you  will  certainly  enter  God’s  kingdom.  We  live  in  
a time of tremendous deception, and so we must be discerning of all 
preachers.
Appreciation and Encouragement
In Chapter  8,  we  read  of  some  of  the  miracles  that  Jesus  did.  He  not  
only preached, but He cared for people as well. He touched lepers whom 
no-one else would touch. He not only healed them thereby but gave them 
a sense of worth. We read here of a Roman centurion who was so humble 
a man and so full of faith that when Jesus said He would come to his 
house to heal his servant, said, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should 
come to my house. Just speak the word and it will be done.” Faith and 
humility  always  go  together.  Jesus  immediately  said  “I  have  not  found  
such great faith in anyone in Israel” (8:10).
Jesus was a master at appreciating and encouraging people. He publicly 
praised Peter once saying, “Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, My Father in 
heaven has revealed this to you” (Matthew 16:17). He praised Nathaniel 
saying,  “There  is  a  man  in  whom  there  is  no  guile”  (John  1:47). Jesus 
was lavish in His appreciation of people, even though none of them were 
perfect.  The  Roman  centurion,  Peter  and  Nathaniel  were  all  imperfect  
people. But yet Jesus found something to appreciate in all of them. He 
did not hesitate to praise the good that He saw even in an unconverted, 
idol-worshipping,  military  captain,  who  knew  nothing  about  the  Bible  
or  the  true  God.  Do  you  think  that  Roman  centurion  ever  forgot  that  
word that Jesus spoke, for the rest of his life? No. He must have been so 
encouraged by those words, that it is more than likely that he became a 
wholehearted disciple of Jesus.

552 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
We can learn something from this about true godliness and about the 
kingdom  of  heaven.  The  children  of  Adam  are  misers  at  appreciating 
people and masters at criticising them. We are hesitant to publicly appre-
ciate people, for fear that they might get puffed up thereby. We cannot 
even  appreciate  genuinely  godly  people.  Most  believers  have  not  learnt  
this habit from Christ. We certainly must not flatter anyone, for flattery 
is Satanic. But genuine appreciation is a Divine characteristic. If a godly 
man  gives  a  word  of  appreciation  to  another  brother,  that  single  word  
could encourage him to follow Jesus wholeheartedly.
In 9:27, we read of two blind men who came to Jesus. But before Jesus 
healed them, He asked them a question. “Do you believe that I am able to 
do this for you?” They said, “Yes, Lord”. Then Jesus told them, “According 
to your faith be it unto you” (9:29). This is a Divine principle: We receive 
according  to  the  measure  of  our  faith  –  no  more  and  no  less.  Did  those  
blind men need a miracle? Yes. Did Jesus want to do a miracle for them? 
Yes. But yet the miracle would not take place if they did not have faith. 
Now apply that to yourself. Do you need a miracle from God? Yes. Does 
God want to do a miracle for you? Yes. But you still may not get it, if you 
don’t have faith.
Suppose one blind man had said, “Well, Lord, I am sure You can open 
at least one eye of mine. Actually that would be more than enough for 
me” The Lord would have said exactly the same words to him, “According 
to your faith be it unto you,” – and he would have got just one eye opened! 
If the second man had said, “Lord, I believe You can open both my eyes”, 
he would have received according to his faith – and would have got both 
eyes opened.
The one-eyed man would then have started the “One-eye” denomina-
tion, proclaiming that Jesus can open one eye. And the other man would 
have started the “Two-eyes” denomination, proclaiming that Jesus can 
open both eyes. And so today, some proclaim half a gospel saying that 
Jesus  can  only  forgive  us  our  sins.  But  a  few  proclaim  the  full  gospel  
saying, “Jesus can not only forgive us our sins. He can also give us victory 
over sin.” The first will call the second a heretic saying, “No, that is not 
possible, because Jesus opened only one eye, in my case.” But that was 
because he had faith only for healing in one eye. The other man had faith 
for healing in both eyes. He trusted the Lord not only for forgiveness, but 
for victory too.
Which  of  these  two  denominations  do  you  belong  to?  If  you  believe  
that Jesus can only forgive your sins, then that’s all you’ll get from Him. 
But  you  will  remain  defeated  by  your  anger,  lust,  pride,  jealousy,  etc.  
Another believer, however, may say, “But Romans 6:14 says further that 
sin cannot rule over me any more because I am under God’s grace. So I 
am going to trust the Lord to fulfil that in my life.” He gets both his eyes 
opened! Don’t call him a heretic. He got something more than you, not 
because he was better than you, but because he trusted Christ for more.

Matthew
Sheep Among Wolves
In Chapter 10, we read about Jesus selecting 12 apostles and giving them 
authority for their ministry. He told them that they would not only have 
His authority in their ministry, but persecution too.
“I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be shrewd as serpents and 
innocent as doves” (10:16). God sends us as sheep into the midst of wolves 
in the world. We must not become like the wolves that surround us. That 
means that we must never take revenge or harm others in any way. We 
must trust God to protect us from the wolves. But at the same time we 
must  be  shrewd  as  serpents.  We  should  not  be  foolish.  We  should  not  
say things that will unnecessarily provoke the non-Christians around us. 
We must be wise in the way we present the gospel. To be wholehearted 
does not mean, for example, that we have to go around denouncing the 
idolatry we see in our country. Our message is positive. We are to lift up 
Jesus Christ, without denouncing anyone else’s religion or culture (See 
the example of Paul in Acts 19:37, where the town-clerk in Ephesus testi-
fied that Paul had not spoken against the goddess they worshipped. We 
are to proclaim that all men (including ourselves) are sinners and that 
Jesus  is  the  Saviour  of  all  men.  People  can  give  up  their  sin  and  their  
idols  only  when  they  surrender  to  Christ,  not  before.  We  must  also  be  
wise as serpents in the way we handle money – especially God’s money. 
We must also be wise in not revealing information to people who don’t 
need to know it. We must not make enemies unnecessarily.
Jesus went on to say that our enemies would be members of our own 
family (10:36). When we follow the Lord, we can expect to be misunder-
stood by our relatives. A prophet is usually never accepted by his own 
relatives.  And  if  we  love  our  earthly  parents  more  than  the  Lord,  then  
we are not worthy of Him (10:37). But if being rejected by men does not 
disturb us and we are willing even to lose our life for Jesus’ sake, then 
we will find it (10:39). And if we give even a cup of water to a disciple of 
Jesus, He will give us a reward (10:42).
The  mind  of  the  Israelites  who  lived  under  the  old  covenant  was  set  
on physical and material blessings in the land of Canaan – on property, 
healing and prosperity. Any believer whose mind is set on these earthly 
things is living under the old covenant. The gospel of Matthew was written 
for all such people. You may say, “We’re not Israelites.” But you may still 
be living under the old covenant. We may call ourselves “Christians”. But 
that does not mean we are living under the new covenant. It depends on 
where  our  mind  is  set.  Conversion  to  Christ  should  bring  a  change  in  
our way of thinking. The word “repentance” means “a change of mind”. 
What is to change in our minds? Colossians 3:2 says, “Set your mind on 
the things that are above and not on things that are on the earth,” for “the 
things  that  are  seen  are  temporal  while  the  things  that  are  unseen  are  
eternal” (2 Corinthians 4:18).

554 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and it seeks to intro-
duce  us  immediately  to  this  heavenly  new  covenant  life.  That’s  why  it  
begins with the sermon on the mount (Matthew 5 to 7). That is describ-
ing a heavenly life on earth, where we keep the commandments of God 
not just externally but inwardly, as we are made partakers of His nature 
through the Holy Spirit. A Christian who lives by the ten commandments 
– avoiding external sins like murder, adultery and theft – and who prays 
and fasts to impress others is really living under the old covenant like all 
the Israelites. We can enter the new covenant only when we understand 
the inner life of the kingdom of heaven.
John the Baptist in Prison
In 11:2, 3, we read that John the Baptist began to doubt whether Jesus 
was  the  Messiah,  when  he  was  in  prison.  John  the  Baptist  had  seen  
heaven opened and the Holy Spirit descending on Jesus and had heard 
a voice from heaven saying, “This is My beloved Son in whom I am well 
pleased” (Matthew 3:16, 17). We would imagine that if we had seen and 
heard something like that once, we would never again have any doubts 
left at all. But here we see that the best person under the old covenant 
(John the Baptist) also began to doubt.
How  did  doubt  come  into  the  heart  of  one,  whom  Jesus  called  the  
greatest  human  being  ever  born?  Because  when  John  heard  about  
the  wonderful  things  Jesus  was  doing  (opening  blind  eyes  and  healing  
the sick), he began to wonder, “If He can do all that, why doesn’t He kill 
Herod and release me from this prison?” The old-covenant mindset has 
no room in it for being in prison. Notice, however, that when those under 
the new covenant like Paul and Silas were in prison, they did not doubt 
God but praised Him instead – even at midnight. That is the difference 
that being filled with the Holy Spirit and entering into the new covenant 
makes. When a Christian gets into a difficulty, if he begins to think, “Why 
doesn’t God kill this difficult person who is troubling me and deliver me 
from this?” – he is thinking exactly like an old-covenant person. 
The vast majority of believers live under the old covenant. When they 
commit adultery they say, “O well, David also committed adultery – and 
he was a man after God’s own heart, and God forgave him.” When they 
get  depressed  they  say,  “Well,  Elijah  also  got  depressed  –  and  he  was  
a  mighty  prophet.”  When  they  get  angry  and  break  something  in  their  
house, they may say, “Well, Moses was a great leader of God’s people and 
he also got angry and even broke the tablets of stone that God Himself 
had  given.”  They  find  a  justification  for  every  sin  of  theirs  in  the  life 
of  some  old-covenant  person.  But  did  Jesus  ever  get  angry  and  break  
anything? Did Jesus ever get depressed and sit under a juniper tree? Did 
Jesus ever commit adultery? No. 
Old-covenant Christians run their race looking unto Moses and David 
and Elijah as their examples; whereas new-covenant Christians run their 

John the Baptist in Prison                                                                                                                        555
Matthew
race  looking  unto  Jesus.  Old-covenant  Christians  don’t  however  follow  
the examples of Moses selflessly praying for others, or of Elijah forsaking 
everything and living wholeheartedly before God’s face, etc. They look at 
these men only to find excuses for their own sins.
The Bible was written to deliver us from sin. But if you read it to find 
an excuse for your sins, then God will allow you to be deceived. Don’t 
ever go to the Scriptures to find an excuse for your anger or your adul-
tery or your depression. The New Testament has been given to show us 
the life of Jesus that we are to partake of – and He was never depressed 
or angry or impure. I want to encourage all of you to look at the New 
Testament in this way from now on (Read 2 Corinthians 3:18).
John the Baptist doubted God when he was imprisoned. But what did 
Jesus do when He was caught by the Roman soldiers? He said that He 
could have called 72,000 angels at that very moment to deliver him. But 
He didn’t do that. So Jesus sent this message back to John the Baptist, 
“Go and tell John that the blind receive sight and the poor have the gospel 
preached to them” (11:4, 5). The new-covenant gospel is the good news 
of  deliverance  from  sin  –  not  deliverance  from  prison  by  killing  Herod,  
Caesar or the Pharisees – and accepting whatever God permits as being 
the very best for us.
However  none  of  us  can  blame  John  the  Baptist  for  his  doubts,  for  
he did not have the Holy Spirit living within him, as we can have today, 
under  the  new  covenant.  He  was  not  under  grace  but  under  the  law.  
What shall we say, however, of Christians today who claim to be filled 
with the Holy Spirit but yet live lives defeated by sin and doubt?
We also see a beautiful example here of Jesus expressing appreciation 
for people publicly. He said, “Among those who are born of women there 
has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist” (11:11). According to 
Jesus, who was the greatest human being born before Him? It was John 
the Baptist – not Mary, the mother of Jesus, as some Christians imagine!! 
Those who adore Mary should adore John the Baptist even more!!
And then Jesus went on to say, “Yet the one who is least in the kingdom 
of heaven is greater than he” (11:11). That means, the least person who 
has entered into the new covenant will not ask questions like John asked, 
“Lord,  why  aren’t  You  releasing  me?”  He  will  know  that  God  causes  
everything to work for his good. Who is your example today? We find 
many  good  qualities  in  Abraham,  Moses,  Elijah  and  John  the  Baptist  
that  we  can  follow.  But,  we  don’t  have  to  follow  them  in  their  failures.  
Our example today is Jesus alone.
In 11:12,  Jesus  said,  “The  kingdom  of  heaven  suffers  violence,  and  
violent  men  take  it  by  force.”  What  does  it  mean  to  be  a  violent  man?  
Externally, a Christian must always be a man of peace. But inwardly, he 
must do violence to everything that stands in the way of his following the 
Lord – he must stand strongly against the lusts in his flesh, against sin 

556 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
and against Satan. Only such can possess the kingdom and enter into 
the new covenant.
If you are half-hearted, you will never be a disciple of Jesus and you 
won’t possess the kingdom of heaven either. If you don’t do violence to 
every attachment that prevents you from loving God with all your heart – 
whether that attachment be to your parents, to your job, to your money, 
to  a  girl,  or  to  anything  else  –  you  will  remain  a  third-rate,  mediocre  
Christian, and really no better than the old covenant Israelites – because 
your mind too is set on earthly things, as theirs was. The Lord is seeking 
to lift us up to the new covenant – to be heavenly-minded.
Revelation and Rest
Then Jesus went on to say, “Father, I praise You that You hid these things 
from the wise and the intelligent and revealed them to babes” (11:25). The 
great truths of the new covenant have been hidden by God. You cannot 
discover  them  by  study.  You  can  read  every  commentary  in  the  world,  
but  you  won’t  discover  them,  because  they  are  hidden  from  the  clever  
and the intelligent. You need revelation, and God gives that only to those 
who are like babes – who have, a pure heart. Whether they have a clever 
head or not doesn’t matter. Intelligence gives us no advantage whatsoever 
in God’s kingdom. It’s a pure heart that gets God’s revelations.
Children  are  also  teachable.  A  little  child  is  ignorant  and  gladly  
acknowledges its ignorance. For example, he will ask his father, “Daddy, 
why are yellow lines drawn on the road?” We adults know that those lines 
are drawn to divide the road for the traffic. But a child doesn’t know even 
a  simple  thing  like  that.  Very  few  believers  come  to  the  Holy  Spirit  in  
that way, saying, “Lord, You wrote this Book. What does this mean? I am 
foolish in spiritual matters. Please explain it to me.” In the new covenant, 
we have the privilege of being filled with the Holy Spirit and to have Him 
Himself teach us the Scriptures that He wrote.
Christ  has  appointed  teachers  in  the  church.  But  when  listening  to  
those teachers, if you stop with what you receive from them, you will 
never  know  God.  What  they  teach  you  may  be  true,  but  you  get  it  
second-hand  from  them.  You  have  to  take  that  second-hand  stuff  
before the Lord and say, “Lord, make this first-hand knowledge for me. 
Make it my own experience.” Then those truths will be yours forever. 
If you don’t do that, then even the truths you receive from heaven will 
become stale – like the manna sent from heaven began to breed worms 
within 24 hours. But the manna that was kept in God’s presence in the 
most holy place remained fresh at all times. 
In 11:28, Jesus said, “Come to Me, all you who labour and are heavy 
laden and I will give you rest.” This is the fulfilment of the Old-Testament 

Revelation and Rest                                                                                                                                  557
Matthew
Sabbath. The new-covenant Sabbath is not a day of physical rest, but an 
inner rest that Jesus gives us. He gives it first of all, to those who come 
to Him acknowledging that they are weary and heavy laden. I have had 
people  come  to  me  saying,  “Brother  Zac,  I  want  to  join  your  church.”  
I ask them why they want to join our church and they reply, “Because 
I  am sick and tired of my present church.” I then tell them, “If you are 
sick and tired of your present church, after a little while, you will become 
sick  and  tired  of  us  too.  So  don’t  join  us.  We  are  actually  a  bunch  of  
people who are sick and tired of ourselves, not sick and tired of others. If 
you are sick and tired of yourself, then you are welcome to join us; and 
we’ll have wonderful fellowship together.
Many pastors are constantly seeking to increase the numbers in their 
churches. But Jesus invited only those who were sick and tired of their 
defeated lives to come to Him. Are you sick and tired of your depressed, 
gloomy life and of the failures in your family life? Are you fed up of the 
lack of freshness and anointing in your ministry? Then the Lord invites 
you saying, “Come to Me and I will give you rest.”
It is not God’s will that we should ever be agitated or upset. He wants 
us  to  be  at  rest  24  hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week  and  52  weeks  a  year,  
whatever may happen around us. But we can live such a life only if we 
acknowledge our defeated state first and come to the Lord and say, “Lord, 
give me this Sabbath-rest at any cost.”
In 11:29, Jesus said, “Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me – for 
I am gentle and humble in heart”. A disciple is a learner and he comes to 
Jesus to learn from Him, like a teachable child. What does the Lord want 
us to learn from Him first of all? Many want to learn how to preach, how 
to heal the sick, and how to prophesy, etc. But the Lord wants us to learn 
gentleness and humility from Him first of all. In fact, those are the only 
two things that He ever asked anyone to learn from Him. But there are 
not many Christians who are eager to learn these two virtues. And that 
is why they do not experience His Sabbath-rest either.
When  you  see  a  godly  man  with  an  anointed  and  effective  ministry,  
you may long to have a ministry like his. But that is the wrong thing to 
pursue after. What you need to emulate first is his godly life. 
The Lord may call us to be fishers of men or teachers in His church. 
But He wants us to live “in rest” first. If we are not at rest in our own 
hearts, we will have many problems ourselves and cause problems for 
others too.
Significantly, immediately after Jesus spoke about this rest, He went 
on to demolish the false Jewish understanding of the Sabbath (12:1–13).  
First,  when  His  disciples  were  picking  some  grain  on  the  Sabbath  day  
and the Pharisees questioned it, Jesus immediately defended His disci-
ples  quoting  the  example  of  David  and  the  Levitical  priests  (12:1–8). 

558 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
Then He healed a man in the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stopped 
the criticism of the Pharisees by saying, “If a sheep of yours falls into a 
pit on a Sabbath day, won’t you pull it out immediately? Isn’t a man more 
important  than  a  sheep?”  (12:9–13).  Legalistic  people  are  very  narrow-
minded  and  selfish.  They  take  good  care  of  themselves,  but  are  very 
uncaring about the needs and sufferings of others.
In 12:24, 31, 32, we read that the Pharisees said that Jesus was casting 
out demons by Beelzebul the prince of demons. Jesus replied, “Have you 
spoken against Me? It’s forgiven.” When Miriam criticised Moses saying. 
“Why did you marry that woman?”, she got leprosy (as a judgement from 
God). But when the Pharisees criticised Jesus saying He was in league 
with Satan, they got forgiveness!! That is the difference between the old 
covenant and the new covenant. The blood of Abel cried out for judge-
ment.  The  blood  of  Jesus  cries  out  for  mercy  (Hebrews  12:24).  If  you  
want God to judge those who hurt you, then you are still under the old 
covenant. But if you want God to forgive them, then you are a disciple of 
Jesus Christ.
In 12:36, 37, Jesus taught about the importance of our speech: “Every 
careless word that men shall speak, they shall give an account in the 
day of judgement.” After observing believers in many parts of the world 
for more than 50 years, I am convinced that 95% of believers do not 
believe these words of Jesus. They do not believe that they will have to 
give an account to God one day for every useless word they ever spoke. 
That  is  why  they  continue  to  speak  evil  of  others,  gossip,  backbite,  
crack filthy jokes, etc. They hurt others with their jokes too. Humour is 
a good thing. But humour that hurts others is not godly. You can get a 
reputation for humour thereby, but it is a careless word for which you 
will have to give an account in the day of judgement.
Most people don’t believe that God has a record of every word that we 
have  ever  spoken.  It  is  recorded  in  our  memory.  There  is  a  video  tape  
that has been running in our memory ever since we were born. Like a 
computer’s  memory,  it  has  recorded  every  thought,  word  and  deed  of  
ours. In the day of judgement, God will display all that for everyone to 
see. If you believe God’s Word, you will be careful with your speech.
We all believe in justification by faith. That is Scriptural. But if you are 
a balanced Christian, you will also believe in justification by works – for 
that is also Scriptural. Romans 4 speaks about justification by faith. But 
faith without works is dead. So, James 2 speaks about justification by 
works – works of faith. Here in Matthew 12:37, Jesus said that we would 
be justified or condemned in the final day, by the words we spoke. On the 
day of judgement, when the words you spoke are played back from your 
memory, will you be justified or condemned? That is a question we must 
all consider now – before it is too late.

Matthew
In  the  new  covenant  we  are  to  have  a tongue of fire.  On  the  day  of  
Pentecost a tongue of fire came on people’s heads, symbolising a tongue 
under the permanent control of the Holy Spirit. Many Christians mistake 
this to refer to speaking in unknown tongues. It is more than that. It is 
a tongue under the control of the Holy Spirit all the time. Many speak in 
other tongues as led by the Spirit and then speak in their mother-tongue 
led by the devil. I am thankful that the Holy Spirit has given me, not only 
the gift of speaking in unknown languages, but above all the ability to 
control my speech in my known languages as well. In the old covenant 
they could not control their tongues, because they did not have the Holy 
Spirit dwelling within. But today we can live on a higher plane.
In 12:40, Jesus refers to Jonah staying in the belly of a large fish for 
three days and three nights. Then He said, “So shall the Son of Man be in 
the heart of the earth.” When Jesus died, He went immediately to Paradise 
(which  was  located  in  the  centre  of  the  earth  at  that  time).  There,  the  
converted  thief  joined  Him  a  little  later.  Jesus’  body  alone  was  in  the  
grave. (When Jesus ascended, He took Paradise up with Him to the third 
heaven). Jesus died at 3 o’clock on the afternoon of the Passover day – 
which fell on a Thursday that year, and not on a Friday (as is commonly 
believed). The Friday that followed that day was the first day of the feast 
of unleavened bread – and this was “a special Sabbath” (See John 19:31). 
The day following that was the weekly Sabbath-day. So there were two 
consecutive Sabbaths that followed Jesus’ crucifixion. That was why the 
women could come to the grave to anoint Him only on Sunday morning. 
Jesus was alive for three days and nights in the heart of the earth exactly 
like Jonah was alive in the belly of the sea-monster. Then He came back 
into His body and “arose from the dead”.
Seven Parables of the Kingdom
In 13:1–52, we read seven of the parables that Jesus spoke. They are 
called parables of the kingdom of heaven. The first was the parable 
of  the  sower.  Notice  throughout  this  chapter  that  Jesus  spoke  of  the  
kingdom of heaven in its outward expression – the way people of this 
world see “the church”. That was why He said that in the kingdom of 
heaven there were people with good and bad ground in their hearts. He 
also said that the kingdom of heaven was like a field in which wheat 
and tares were both found. He explained later that the field was the 
world, not the  church  (13:38).  Some  Christians  misquote  this  parable  
and say, “Since Jesus said that both wheat and tares must be allowed 
to grow in the church, we should not separate them. So we must allow 
unconverted people and converted people to be in the church. They say 
that because they haven’t read the Scriptures properly. The field is the 
world – and it is there that God allows believers and unbelievers to grow 
together – not in the church. In the local church, we must ensure that 

560 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
(as far as is humanly discernible) only those who have repented of their 
sins and have been born again through faith in Christ, are allowed to be 
members. The others are welcome to attend and listen to the messages. 
But it must be made clear to them that they cannot become a part of 
the local church – the body of Christ – until they are born again.
13:31–32  is  a  parable  about  a  mustard  seed  that  normally  grows  to  
become only a small plant. But in this case, it grew up unnaturally and 
became a huge tree. This is a parable of how God does not intend a local 
church to grow. God intends that each local church be a small group of 
brothers and sisters (like the small mustard plant) who know each other, 
love  one  another  and  manifest  His  life  to  others  in  their  locality.  But  
gifted preachers have built mega-churches (like the large tree), contrary 
to  God’s  plan  –  where  people  come  only  to  listen  to  sermons,  just  like  
they go to watch football matches and movies. Jesus said that only a very 
few would find the way to life (Matthew 7:13, 14). But clever preachers 
can  easily  gather  large  crowds,  by  lowering  the  standards  of  holiness,  
avoiding  all  preaching  about  repentance,  about  self-denial  and  about  
taking up the cross. Thus, one can get a crowd of people who are not at 
all  interested  in  being  disciples  of  Christ,  but  only  in  listening  to  good  
sermons  on  Sundays.  When  you  increase  the  size  of  your  church  this  
way, what happens next will be what Jesus spoke of in this parable: The 
birds of the air (which Jesus said in an earlier parable represented the 
agents of the evil one – 13:4, 19) come and sit on the branches of the tree. 
If, however, you had sought to make disciples alone, your church would 
have been smaller in size, but purer and free from Satanic influences and 
the problems that such influences bring!
In 13:33, Jesus spoke about the kingdom of heaven being like leaven. 
This  is  a  prophecy  about  how  corruption  would  spread  in  the  local  
church. Again and again, Jesus warns about the dangers that would face 
the church – bad ground, tares, demons sitting inside the church, and 
leaven.  If  Christian  leaders  had  paid  attention  to  these  parables,  they  
could have saved their churches from spiritual death – and they would 
have emphasised discipleship.
Then Jesus spoke two parables where He explained what it meant to 
be a disciple. In 13:44, He said that the kingdom of heaven was like a 
man who had found a field with a treasure hidden in it. The man sold 
all that he had and bought that field. This is a picture of a person who 
is willing to give up everything that is precious to him, in order to be a 
disciple of Jesus – and thus possess God’s kingdom. The second parable, 
about a man who bought a very expensive pearl after selling all that he 
had, emphasised the same truth. Notice in both cases, the expression ‘all 
that he had.’ Jesus said, “No-one can be My disciple unless he forsakes 
all that he has” (Luke 14:33). That is the only way to be a disciple and 
possess God’s kingdom.

Seven Parables of the Kingdom                                                                                                              561
Matthew
In 13:47–50,  Jesus  spoke  about  the  outward  expression  of  God’s  
kingdom on earth having two types of fish – the good and the bad. But at 
the end of the age, the angels come in and separate the righteous from 
the wicked (verse 49).
In 13:52,  we  have  a  good  word  for  students  of  the  Bible.  A  scribe  is  
one who carefully studies the Scriptures. But it says here that the scribe 
must become a disciple. Then, when he preaches, he can bring forth from 
his treasure, new truths as well as the old truths with freshness. If you 
remain a scribe, however, your ministry will be dead.
In 14:25–31, we see Jesus walking on the water. But the greater miracle 
here is that Peter also walked on the water. This is a picture of the over-
coming life. What is it that prevents us from walking on water? It is the 
law of gravity that pulls us down. The law of gravity pulled Jesus down 
too. But by the power of God He overcame it and walked on the water. 
The law of gravity was not negated or destroyed, but overcome. As long 
as  Peter  looked  at  Jesus  and  trusted  Him,  Peter  also  would  be  able  to  
overcome the law of gravity. Otherwise it would overcome him, as it did 
a few moments later.
The law of sin is also like the law of gravity. Temptation seeks to pull 
us.  Jesus  too  was  tempted  exactly  as  we  are  (Hebrews  4:15). But  He  
overcame  the  downward  pull  of  temptation  by  the  power  of  God  –  and  
so  He  never  sinned  (Matthew  4:1–10).  If  we  look  to  Him  for  the  same  
power,  we  too  can  overcome  as  He  overcame  –  but  only  as  long  as  we  
keep looking to Him (Revelation 3:21; Hebrews 12:1, 2). If, however, we 
look at the sub-standard level that other Christians live at, or even at the 
old-covenant examples of Moses and Jeremiah, we will not overcome. 
To  have  “faith”  is  to  look  at  Jesus.  And  “grace”  is  the  supernatural  
power of God. When we are “under this grace, sin cannot rule over us” 
(Romans 6:14). The moment Peter looked away from the Lord, he went 
down – and so will we. And if we do go down, what should we do? Do 
what  Peter  did.  He  cried  out  saying,  “Lord,  save  me”.  He  didn’t  wait  
until he reached the bottom of the sea. No. He cried out as soon as he 
was beginning to sink. And so must we. The moment you find tempta-
tion’s pull to be too strong, cry out to the Lord to save you. Say, “Lord, 
I am about to fall into lust (or anger, or whatever). Please save me.” He 
will give you grace at that very moment and make you stand. “He is 
able to keep you from falling” (Jude 24) – for He is the same yesterday, 
today and forever (Hebrews 13:8).
In 15:13,  Jesus  said,  “Every  plant  which  My  heavenly  Father  did  not  
plant  will  be  rooted  out.”  The  question  here  is  not  whether  it  is  a  good  
plant, or a big plant, or one that others appreciate. The question is “Who 
planted it – you or God?” We can have our own bright ideas to do God’s 
work and produce something thereby that looks very impressive in the 

562 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
sight of men. But in the final day the Lord will see whether this idea 
originated with God or in your own brain. Listen to this statement very 
carefully: God is the only legitimate originator of anything in this universe. 
Anything that originates with you or me is doomed to be destroyed one 
day. The first words in the Bible are, “In the beginning God....”  That’s  
how it must be in every area of our life. That is why we need to pray and 
wait on God and seek his leading in every step of life – if we are to live a 
worthwhile life by eternity’s standards.
You  can  have  a  good  desire  to  go  somewhere  to  serve  the  Lord.  But  
where  did  that  idea  originate  from?  Did  someone  urge  you  to  go?  Or  
perhaps you yourself wanted to go. But did you wait on the Lord and seek 
His will? Did He put a burden in your heart for that work? If the burden 
was His, then there will be eternal fruit – not otherwise. Are you trying to 
build a church in some place, just like you saw someone else do? It won’t 
be the church of Jesus Christ. It will be your church.
In a country like India, it is very easy to gather people together anywhere, 
because there are so many poor people who want material benefits. Such 
people don’t come to you to become disciples of Jesus Christ, or to deny 
themselves  and  hate  sin  and  become  overcomers.  No.  They  come  for  
some earthly gain. I have lived all my life in India – and I know the reality 
of much so-called “Christian work” here. Did you wait on the Lord and 
seek to know His calling for your life before going out to serve Him? Are 
you seeking money (or perhaps your own honour) in doing God’s work? 
These are the important questions you must ask yourself. You may not 
take heed to these words now, but in the day of judgement you will wish 
you had. It is best to humble yourself now and say, “Lord, I don’t want 
anything in my life that did not originate with You”.
So  we  should  never  rush  into  doing  things  for  God  –  either  by  the  
promptings of our own reason or that of others. “He who believes will not 
make haste” (Isaiah 28:16 - KJV). “Do you see a man who is hasty in his 
matters? There is more hope for a fool than for him.” (Proverbs 29:20 - NASB 
margin). Wait on the Lord and allow Him to put His thoughts into your 
mind. His thoughts are as much better and higher and more productive 
than  your  thoughts,  as  heaven  is  above  the  earth  (Isaiah  55:8,  9).  But  
make sure that you are not seeking your own glory or depending on your 
own resources for the Lord’s work. Do things according to His bidding – 
and all your plants will remain forever.
The Church that Jesus Builds
In 16:15, we see Jesus asking Simon, “Who am I?” Simon replied, “You 
are  the  Christ,  the  Son  of  the  living  God.”  Jesus  immediately  praised  
him  publicly  saying,  “Blessed  are  you,  Simon,  son  of  Jonah,  because  
you did not understand this through your own intelligence or cleverness. 
My Father revealed it to you.” Notice the word ‘revealed’ here. This is a 

The Church that Jesus Builds                                                                                                                  563
Matthew
new- covenant word. Under the old covenant, people studied the law and 
meditated on it. The blessed man was the one who meditated on the law 
of the Lord day and night (Psalm 1:2). But under the new covenant, the 
blessed man is the one who gets revelation, like Peter. Paul’s prayer for 
the Ephesian Christians was, that they may get “the spirit of revelation” 
(Ephesians 1:17). The Holy Spirit opened Peter’s heart to see something 
that he could never have discovered with any amount of human intelli-
gence.  There  were  cleverer  people  than  him  in  Israel  at  that  time,  who  
had studied the Bible much more than him. But they thought Jesus was 
the  prince  of  devils!!  God  reveals  the  Scriptures  to  those  who  come  to  
Him in humility like little babes (Matthew 11:25).
In 16:18, Jesus said to Simon, “You are Peter (petros – Greek), and upon 
this rock (petra – Greek) I will build My church.” He called Simon “petros” 
(“a small stone”) and said that the church would be built on the “petra” 
(“a large rock”) that Simon had just confessed by revelation – Christ the 
Son of the living God. Simon Peter was not the rock-foundation. Jesus used 
two completely different words here, as we have just seen (in the Greek), 
which doesn’t come through so clearly when translated into English. 
In 16:18,  19,  Jesus  said,  “Upon  this  rock  I  will  build  My  church;  and  
the  gates  of  Hades  will  not  overpower  it.  I  will  give  you  the  keys  of  the  
kingdom  of  heaven;  and  whatever  you  bind  on  earth  shall  have  been  
bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed 
in heaven.” This was the first time that Jesus spoke about the church – 
and He spoke of the church facing battle with the forces of spiritual death 
– “the gates of Hades”. When I first read this, I pictured the church being 
attacked by Satan on all four sides, and the church managing to hold on 
and survive until the Lord returns. But that was not what Jesus said. 
He did not say that the gates of Hades would attack the church, but that 
the church would attack the gates of Hades and overpower those gates. 
In those days, a city was surrounded by walls and could be entered only 
through its gates. If you got through the gates, then you had overpowered 
the city. So Jesus spoke of an attacking church that would be engaged 
in  spiritual  warfare  and  overpower  the  forces  of  evil  –  binding  Satan’s  
activities and loosing people who were held captive by him.
This is not a defensive battle, but an attacking one. We go against the 
fortresses of Satan in the world and register the victory of the cross in 
one place after another. We don’t sit in a corner and say, “O Lord, help us 
to hold on until You come”. 
There is a well-known Christian hymn that I have never liked to sing. 
It says, “Hold the fort for I am coming,” says the Lord. That presents a 
picture of a church struggling inside a fort, with the devil attacking it 
on every side, and the church somehow seeking to hold on until Christ 
comes. But it is not like that. It’s the devil who is inside a fort and we 
are attacking him at his gates. The picture we must always keep in our 

564 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
mind is that of a triumphant church following a triumphant Captain 
and attacking the devil. If we are totally submitted to God and we resist 
Satan, he will flee from us (James 4:7). He doesn’t just walk away, he 
will run away.
We are to walk as Jesus walked on this earth. Wherever Jesus went, 
demons trembled and Satan was scared. We are to walk on earth in the 
same way. “Every place that the sole of our foot treads on, God has given 
to us” (Joshua 1:3). So we don’t live in fear of Satan or what he can do 
to us. No. He is the one who has to be afraid of us. We will never be able 
to build the church of Jesus Christ if we don’t take that attitude against 
Satan. Our Lord Jesus has already bound the strong man. We can now 
go in and take the strong man’s goods! Hallelujah!
In 18:3, Jesus  said,  “Unless  you  become  converted  and  become  like  
children  you  shall  not  enter  the  kingdom  of  heaven.”  Jesus  was  speak-
ing about humility here. “Whoever humbles himself like this child...”. In 
other words, Jesus was saying here that humility is the first and foremost 
requirement for entering God’s kingdom.
I have often told people that there are three secrets for living a godly 
Christian life. First, humility. Second, humility. Third, humility. That’s it. 
Humble yourself, and acknowledge that you are foolish and ignorant when 
it comes to spiritual matters, even if you are clever in worldly matters.
As  human  beings,  we  are  so  full  of  self-confidence,  because  of  our 
pride. Little babies are not self-confident. A 6-month old baby will cry 
if  you  take  it  away  from  it  mother’s  arms.  It  feels  insecure  outside  its  
 mother’s arms, because it is so helpless. Just as the Lord wants us to 
be bold when confronting Satan, He wants us to recognise our helpless-
ness and depend on Him totally. This is the dual picture of the Christian: 
A fearless warrior when facing Satan and his evil forces, but a little child 
before Almighty God. Keep that dual attitude always. In spiritual matters, 
we are ignorant and foolish and don’t even know our A,B,C. That is why 
we cling to the Lord always – and then we will be perfectly safe and will 
also be protected from saying and doing many foolish things. 
In 18:18–20, we see the second time that Jesus spoke about the church. 
Here he speaks about the authority of the church to bind Satan and to 
loose believers held in his grip. But this authority can be exercised only 
by a minimum of two believers who are united. When two believers are 
one in their spirit, the Lord comes into their midst (18:20). Only then can 
they bind Satan’s activities. We cannot bind Satan himself. The Lord will 
do that Himself one day in the future (Revelation 20). But we can bind his 
activities – if two are united in spirit. A husband and wife can keep Satan 
out of their home forever if they are united. Two elders can keep Satan 
out of their church forever if they are united. Satan knows this and that 
is why he always seeks to separate husband and wife and separate elders 
in a church.

More Parables                                                                                                                                           565
Matthew
In 18:21–35, Jesus spoke the parable of the unmerciful servant who 
did not forgive his fellow-servant. He was teaching here that even if our 
sins are once forgiven by God, they can then be “un-forgiven”, if we don’t 
forgive just one other person!! This king forgave the slave a huge debt. 
But when that slave did not forgive his fellow-slave, his own forgiveness 
was  cancelled.  And  then  Jesus  said,  “So  will  My  heavenly  Father  do  to  
you if you don’t forgive your brother from your heart” (verse 35). All the 
sins God forgave you will be put back to your account if you don’t forgive 
somebody  else,  and  you  will  go  right  on  to  hell.  Not  only  that,  Jesus  
also said that that slave was handed over to the torturers. This means 
that God will withdraw His protection from believers who do not forgive 
others,  so  that  demons  can  then  torment  them.  This  is  one  reason  for  
some sicknesses among believers.
More Parables
In 20:1–16,  Jesus  spoke  a  parable  about  labourers  who  came  to  work  
for their master at different hours of the day. In this parable, there were 
five groups of workers. The first four groups – who worked for 12 hours, 
9  hours,  6  hours  and  3  hours  –  all  worked  on  the  basis  of  a  contract,  
for pay. The last group alone – who worked only for one hour – worked 
without  any  contract,  with  no  assurance  of  any  pay.  At  the  end  of  the  
day, that last group got the same wage as the first group. In other words, 
they received 12 times the hourly wage of the first group!! What the Lord 
was  teaching  thereby  was  that  those  who  served  the  Lord  for  reward,  
would get their reward last, even if they laboured for Him for many, many 
years. But those who served the Lord out of gratitude and joy, without 
expecting  any  reward,  would  get  the  highest  reward  in  heaven,  even  if  
they laboured only for a very brief time. It is the quality of our work that 
matters to God and not the quantity. It is the motive with which we serve 
the Lord that matters most. “Why” we did what we did, will matter much 
more in the final day than “What” we did. It is good to realise that now.
In Chapter 22, we see three important truths: (a) We can enter God’s 
kingdom  only  if  we  receive  the  free  robe  of  the  righteousness  of  Christ  
(verses 1–14). (b) We must clear our debts to man first (“Caesar” repre-
sents today, the government and all human beings), before we give any 
money  to  God  (verse  21). (c)  The  message  of  the  entire  Bible  can  be  
summed  up  in  two  statements:  Love  God  with  all  your  heart,  and  love  
your neighbour as yourself (verses 37–40). These are great truths worth 
meditating on – for many people go astray in these areas, following the 
teachings of men rather than of our Lord.
In Chapter  23,  Jesus  exposes  the  hypocrisy  and  counterfeit  religion  
of the Pharisees, and He condemns them severely. They fasted, prayed 
and tithed, their doctrines were all correct, and they even had a mission-
ary programme (23:15). They resigned their jobs and travelled to distant 

566 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
lands to make converts. But Jesus said that their converts were double 
the children of hell. That is what every legalist is – and when he converts 
another  person  to  his  legalistic  version  of  Christianity,  he  makes  that  
person twofold a child of hell. So don’t imagine that all missionary activ-
ity is of God. It is only when we make disciples and teach them to love 
Jesus supremely, and to love others as Christ loved us, that we deliver 
them from hell.
If, on the other hand, we make converts who just “look Christian” on 
the  outside  and  follow  all  the  rules  we  make  for  them,  then  we  have  
deceived them and will only populate Hell thereby. It is easy to get people 
to change externally and to follow a form. I visited a village once where 
some  missionaries  had  “converted”  some  of  the  people  to  their  version  
of  “Christianity”  many  years  ago.  But  there  was  no  holiness  in  any  of  
their lives. The only difference was that they now sang songs to Christ 
instead of to other gods. Some of them may have changed their names to 
“Christian” names. They had just been made twofold the children of hell 
by those missionaries.
Jesus denounced the Pharisees with very strong words, calling them 
“vipers” (23:33). He had the right to do that, because He was going to 
die  for  the  sins  He  denounced  in  them.  He  had  sought  for  years  “to 
gather them as a hen gathers her little chicks under its wings” (23:37). 
We  too  can  have  the  right  to  denounce  sin  in  others  only  if  we  are  
willing  to  lay  down  our  lives,  if  necessary,  to  save  them  from  their  
sin. If we denounce sin, without loving people like that, we are merely 
“self-appointed prophets” – and hypocrites.
Christ’s Second Coming
In Chapter  24, Jesus spoke of His final return to earth. The first sign 
of  the  last  days  (that  He  spoke  of  repeatedly)  was  that  there  would  be  
a  great  deal  of  deception  in  the  last  days  (verses  4,  11,  24).  Then  He  
spoke of the fig tree (a picture of the nation of Israel)  that  was  cursed  
by Him for having only leaves (religion) without fruit (spirituality) (Mark 
11:13–21),  putting  forth  its  leaves  (religion  without  spirituality)  once  
again (Matthew 24:32, 33). The nation of Israel was scattered 40 years 
after Christ’s crucifixion, but they have come back to the land and repos-
sessed Jerusalem for the first time only in our lifetime – in 1967. Thus 
we know that our Lord’s coming is very near. Jesus also taught here that 
He would return to take His children up to be with Him, AFTER the great 
tribulation is over (verse 29). He also said that when He comes, everyone 
would see Him, for He would come like the lightning that everyone can 
see (verse 27). He also told us not to believe those who taught that He 
would come secretly (verse 26). He said here that He would come in the 
clouds with the angels and with a loud trumpet and gather His children 

The Great Commission                                                                                                                            567
Matthew
from all parts of the world. The rapture of the saints is described here by 
Jesus exactly as Paul also mentions it later in 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17. 
Jesus made it crystal clear here that this rapture would take place only 
after  the  great  tribulation  is  over  (verse  29).  We  must  not  believe  the  
traditions of men on this matter but the clear teaching of our Lord. 
In Chapter 25, Jesus expanded on His teaching (in the closing verses of 
Chapter 24) that people should be ready for His coming, with three para-
bles. The way to prepare for the coming of Christ is not by understanding 
the  timetable  of  His  coming  and  by  studying  prophetic  charts,  but  by  
being spiritually ready. Our heart is more important than our mind. The 
first parable was about heart-purity. The ten virgins represent Christians 
who are clean on the outside. The five wise virgins who had “extra oil in 
their vessels” represent those whose hearts are filled with love for Christ 
by the Holy Spirit (verses 1–13). If love for Christ is not the motive for all 
that we do for the Lord, then even if we are pure externally, we are foolish. 
The church in Ephesus became like these foolish virgins, having lost its 
“first love” (Revelation 2:4). The second parable related to being faithful 
in using the gifts God has given us, for His kingdom (verses 14–30). God 
has given us different degrees of abilities and opportunities to serve Him. 
And He expects us to produce fruit only according to the measure of what 
He has given us – not more. That was why the person who produced five 
talents received the same reward and commendation as the person who 
produced only two talents (verses 21, 23). The third parable (of the sheep 
and the goats) shows us that we will be rewarded by God according to the 
way we treat our fellow-believers who are in need (verses 31–36). This is 
the proof that our faith is living and genuine (James 2:14–17).
In 27:3, we  see  how  even  “repentance”  can  be  hollow  and  insincere. 
Judas  had  some  sort  of  repentance  (feeling  of  sorrow  for  his  sin),  but  
instead  of  going  to  the  Lord  and  confessing  his  sin  to  Him,  he  went  to  
the priests (like many do today). So he went to hell. The Lord alone can 
forgive us our sins – no-one else.
In the first few verses of Chapter  28,  we  read  of  the  resurrection  of  
Christ. Without His resurrection, His death would have been in vain, for 
there would have been no proof that He was Who He claimed to be – the 
Son of God. Christianity rests on this twin unshakeable foundation – the 
death of Christ for our sins and His resurrection. This is what makes it 
different from all religions. Notice that Christ had left the grave before the 
angel rolled away the stone (verse 2). The angel rolled away the stone, not 
for the Lord to leave the grave, but for His disciples to go in and see that 
He had risen.
The Great Commission
In 28:18–20, we read of the great commission that Jesus gave His disci-
ples – and to us. The basis of the great commission is that all authority 

568 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Promised Messiah 
Matthew
in heaven and earth has been given to our Lord. We should not go out to 
make disciples if we are not convinced that our Lord rules heaven and 
earth with absolute authority. We don’t go to make disciples because there 
is a need somewhere or because someone urged us to go, but because 
Jesus  Christ  has  all  authority  in  heaven  and  earth  and  He  commands  
us to go.
What are we to go and do in every nation? We are to make disciples 
–  not  mere  converts.  We  are  not  to  just  get  them  to  “accept  Christ  into  
their hearts”. A disciple is a learner and a follower of the Lord Jesus. This 
is what we are to make people into in every nation. Only those who are 
willing to become disciples should be baptised.
Baptism in the threefold Name is not optional. It is essential. We are 
not to be like the inter-denominational groups that say, “We won’t preach 
on baptism because that will disturb our unity.” We will preach all that 
our Lord told us to preach. Then after that, we are to build all those disci-
ples  into  local  churches,  where  we  teach  them  to  do  every  single  thing  
that Jesus commanded.
The  great  commission  is  very  clear.  First:  Go.  Then,  make  disciples.  
Then baptise them. Then, spend the rest of the time teaching them to 
obey every single thing that Jesus commanded. This great commission 
is surrounded on either side by a statement and a promise. First, “All 
authority  is  given  to  the  Lord  Jesus.”  And  at  the  end,  “I  am  with  you  
always unto the end of the age.”
Many like to claim that promise of the Lord, “Lo, I am with you always.” 
But to whom was it given? It was given only to those who go and make 
disciples,  and  then  teach  them  to  obey  ALL  that  Jesus  commanded  
(28:19, 20) – and not to believers who go here and there to make money. 
Such believers cannot claim that promise. But if you seek to make disci-
ples everywhere you go, then you can claim the promise that the Lord will 
be with you always.

MARK
Jesus Christ – The Son of God
T
here  must  be  many  good  reasons  why  God  allowed  four  biogra-
phies of Jesus Christ to be written by four different people instead 
of one consolidated biography by one person. 
Matthew  begins  his  gospel  by  calling  Jesus  “the  Son  of  David,  Son  
of  Abraham”,  and  quotes  numerous  Scriptures,  to  show  the  Jews  that  
Jesus  was  their  promised  Messiah.  Mark,  however,  begins  by  saying:  
“This is the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God.” He wants to empha-
sise  the  Deity  of  Jesus.  In  Mark’s  gospel  there  is  a  greater  description  
of Jesus’ miracles; but not as much teaching or as many parables as in 
Matthew’s gospel. Matthew was laying down the teaching of the kingdom 
of heaven on earth. Mark was demonstrating that Jesus was the Son of 
God on earth.
Learning and Following
“When Jesus was going by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, 
the brother of Simon, casting a net, for they were fishermen. Jesus said to 
them, ‘Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men’ ”  (1:16, 17). There 
were hundreds of fishermen along the coasts of Galilee. He did not call all 
of them. He called only four – Peter, Andrew, James and John. We are all 
called to be witnesses for Christ. But to enter into full-time ministry for 
the Lord, one must be specifically called by God. You cannot say, “I want 
to be an evangelist or a teacher.” God has to call you for that ministry 
and equip you for it. God sovereignly calls His servants even today. Every 
ministry  in  the  Body  of  Christ  is  important,  just  like  every  part  of  the  
human body. Some parts like the face can be seen, whereas others like 
the kidneys and liver are unseen. In the Body of Christ too, some minis-
tries are more visible than others.

570 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Son of God
Mark
In Matthew 11:29, Jesus said, “Learn from Me.” Here He said, “Follow 
Me.” These are the two things that a disciple has to do. A disciple is a 
learner and a follower. All through his life he has to learn from Jesus and 
follow Him. In the army they march saying, “Left, right, left, right.” We 
have to say, “Learn, follow. Learn, follow” – until Christ returns.
If you are only learning but not following, you will be like a man who 
tries to walk only with his left foot, marching to the command, “Left, left, 
left, left”!! But the true disciple of Jesus learns and then practices what 
he has learnt. If you don’t practice what you learn, you will only produce 
others like yourself – who march on one foot. We can never say that we 
have learnt enough. Until the end of our life we have to learn from Jesus.
The  second  part  of  that  verse  is  a  promise.  “If  you  follow  Me,  I  will  
make you....” Think of that expression, “I will make you.” This is like a 
potter making a vessel. Potters don’t make all vessels of the same shape. 
God also makes us in different shapes. Don’t ever ask God to make your 
ministry  in  the  shape  of  some  other  brother’s.  God  will  never  do  that  
because  He  makes  each  vessel  in  a  unique  shape.  If  you  seek  to  have  
someone else’s ministry, you will hinder the shape God is trying to make 
out of you.
I’ve repeatedly told people in my church, “Don’t ever try to imitate my 
ministry  –  because  God  wants  you  to  be  unique.  He  wants  you  to  be  
you.” God wants only one person like me in His church – and He wants 
one person like you.
If you follow the Lord, He will make you what you are supposed to be. 
That is the Lord’s responsibility. In the case of these men, they were to 
be shaped into fishers of men. In your case it may be something else 
–  perhaps  a  help  in  the  church.  Some  are  called  to  be  apostles,  some  
prophets and some evangelists. Evangelists are the fishers of men. Some, 
like Paul, are everything: apostle, prophet, teacher, shepherd and evan-
gelist. But it is rarely that God gives one person all of these special gifts. 
Most of us usually have only one gift. In the early days the apostles had 
to  have  so  many  gifts,  because  there  were  so  few  gifted  people  in  the  
church. But with the expansion of the church, God has distributed the 
gifts more widely. But whichever your gift is, the principle is still: “I will 
make you.” We must allow the Lord to make us what He wants us to be. 
We cannot make ourselves.
Don’t ever try to make yourself into an evangelist or a teacher or an 
apostle  –  for  you  will  be  a  total  failure.  Don’t  ever  try  to  do  a  ministry  
that God never called you to. Humble yourself, wait on the Lord, and let 
Him show you what He has called you for. I’ve seen numerous people in 
this country who have tried to make a ministry for themselves. They get 
money from America and start a ministry. But one day God will pull it 
all out and destroy it. Remember that you have only one life. Don’t waste 
it by trying to impress people that you have some great ministry. Fulfil 
the task God has called you to fulfil in the body of Christ. “Take  heed  

Doing His Father’s Will                                                                                                                             571
Mark
to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfil it.” 
(Colossians 4:17). Wait on the Lord and He will make you into the vessel 
He desires. He doesn’t call everybody for the same thing. All those fisher-
men by the Sea of Galilee could become disciples of Jesus. But they could 
not all become apostles. Apostles have to be called specifically. We need 
to  distinguish  between  the  calling  for  our  life  and  for  our  ministry.  So  
don’t try to force people to have your ministry. That is foolish.
When  Jesus  was  dealing  with  demon-possessed  people,  some  of  the  
demons would cry out, “This is the Son of God” (1:34). Wouldn’t it thrill 
you if others heard that a demon recognised you as a man of God? But 
Jesus told the demons to be silent, because He did not want a testimony 
from  any  demon.  Demons  are  liars  in  any  case.  So  what  is  their  testi-
mony worth? Nothing! We should do what Jesus did. Some people carry 
on a conversation with demons, before casting them out. This is always 
foolish. Jesus never did that. He just cast them out.
Doing His Father’s Will
In 1:35, we read of a habit that Jesus had, that is good for each of us to 
have – getting up early and listening to God (See also Isaiah 50:4). Even 
though  he  was  busy  ministering  late  into  the  previous  night,  He  still  
woke up before the sun rose and got alone with His Father. In which area 
would you like to follow Jesus primarily? In healing the sick? Why not 
start with what is written here? He lived each day listening to His Father 
from  morning  till  night.  Somebody  said  that  just  as  tourists  enquire  
about the sights to be seen whenever they come to a new place, Jesus 
always looked around to see where the lonely and deserted places were, 
where He could be alone with His Father. Some Christians don’t like to 
be alone. They always want to be with others. And that is why their lives 
are so shallow. Jesus wanted to spend time talking to His Father daily, 
because that is where He got His strength and His wisdom from.
When the people came and urged Jesus to stay on there for some more 
time, because a revival had broken out, He said He could not, because He 
had already heard His Father telling Him that morning, to go elsewhere. 
Human reason would suggest that one should stay on in a place where 
revival  has  broken  out.  But  Jesus  was  not  moved  by  the  need  of  the  
people primarily, but by the voice of His Father. If Jesus had woken up 
late and not waited on the Father that morning, He would have followed 
His reason and stayed on in the same place and missed the will of God 
for one day. We may say, “What does it matter if we miss the will of God 
just for  one  day?”  But  for  Jesus  every  day  was  important  in  order  to  
complete  the  task  His  Father  had  assigned  to  Him.  He  was  as  careful  
with His time as we are with our money.
We must have this attitude: “Lord, I don’t want to waste a single day 
of my life. Arrange my circumstances so that I will always be in the place 

572 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Son of God
Mark
where You want me to be – every single day of my life.” That is a good 
prayer to pray. Even if we don’t hear a voice from heaven to direct us, 
God  can  still  arrange  our  circumstances  such  that  we  are  where  God  
wants us to be every day of our life. Don’t go to a place because it is a 
comfortable  place  to  live.  Ask  yourself  whether  God  wants  you  there.  
Then you won’t miss the will of God. And when you come to the end of 
your life, you won’t have any regrets over the way you lived.
Jesus Loved People
In 2:3, we read about a man who was paralysed being brought to Jesus’ 
house. Four people carried him there and when they found they couldn’t 
get in because of the crowd, they decided to break open the roof. How did 
they dare to think of doing such a thing? Because the house belonged to 
Jesus (compare verse 1 with Matthew 4:13) and they knew that He loved 
people so much that He would not mind His house being damaged if it 
would result in someone being healed!! 
Jesus saw the faith of those who carried him in (verse 5) and healed 
the man (verse 11). Generally speaking, we receive from God “according 
to our own faith”. Jesus always worked on the basis of faith, But here we 
see  someone  else’s  faith  bringing  God’s  blessing  to  the  man.  This  man  
may have had no faith at all. But the faith of his friends still brought him 
healing.
A father’s faith once brought deliverance to his demon-possessed son 
(Mark  9:24);  a  Canaanite  mother’s  faith  brought  deliverance  to  her  
daughter (Matthew 15:28); and a centurion’s faith brought healing to 
his  servant  (Matthew  8:13).  So  today,  we  too  can  bring  people  who  
are paralysed and hounded by discouragement and fear, to Jesus in 
prayer,  and  see  Him  delivering  them  through  our  faith.  We  can  pray  
down God’s blessing on others.
We  also  learn  from  this  incident  our  interdependence  in  the  Body  of  
Christ.  We  are  not  to  live  the  Christian  life  all  by  ourselves,  but  along  
with others. It is certainly more convenient to work on our own, because 
we can do what we like, when we like and we are answerable to nobody. 
But those who work like that will finally destroy themselves. Seek for 
fellowship  –  and  that  will  be  to  your  salvation.  Find  a  godly  brother,  
particularly when you are young, and be subject to his authority. When 
you are weak, their faith will carry you through.
In 2:18–22,  we  read  that  Jesus  was  asked  why  His  disciples  did  not  
fast when many other religious groups fasted. The Lord told us to fast 
secretly  and  so,  strictly  speaking,  it  is  none  of  our  business  to  know  
whether  someone  else  fasts  at  all.  Jesus  however  told  them  that  His  
disciples would fast once He (their Bridegroom) had left them and gone 

Jesus Loved People                                                                                                                                   573
Mark
back to heaven. Jesus never gave us a command to fast. But the Bride of 
Jesus will fast and pray – in secret – voluntarily.
Then Jesus explained that in the new covenant, everything (including 
fasting) was different from what it was under the old covenant. There are 
no rules now. Everything is voluntary. He illustrated this by saying that if 
you stitched a piece of new unshrunk cloth on to an old cotton garment, 
the  old  garment  would  tear  when  washed.  The  application  of  this  was  
that you couldn’t take a little bit of new-covenant truth and attach it to 
an  old-covenant  system.  You  can’t  run  a  church  75%  according  to  old  
covenant principles and add a 25% new-covenant patch on it. A church 
must  be  run  100%  by  new-covenant  principles.  Otherwise  it  will  have  
serious problems.
He  then  illustrated  the  same  truth  by  saying  that  new  wine  needed  
new  wineskins  (2:22).  In  those  days,  wine  was  stored  in  animal  skins.  
When  the  wine  inside  began  to  ferment  and  its  volume  expanded,  the  
skin would also expand. But the skin could not stretch beyond a certain 
limit. So if you put new, unfermented wine into an old stretched wineskin, 
it would burst the old skin when it fermented. The old wine is life under 
the law and the old wineskin is the old covenant system. The new wine is 
the life of Jesus and the new wineskin is the new covenant church. If we 
take the life of Jesus, and put it into an old covenant system with priests 
and tithes and rituals and rules, the life of Jesus will burst out of it. If 
you want to retain the old covenant system of laws and regulations, then 
you  must  also  choose  to  live  under  the  Mosaic  Law.  You  can’t  mix  the  
old and the new covenants. The life of Jesus must have a new covenant 
church to express itself in. You have to get rid of the old covenant rules 
totally  from  your  church.  The  vast  majority  of  Christians  however  live  
in church-systems that follow the old covenant. They try to put the new 
wine into their old wineskins and find it bursting here and there, just as 
Jesus said would happen.
In 3:1–6,  we  read  that  Jesus  went  into  a  synagogue  on  a  Sabbath  
day.  There  was  a  man  with  a  paralysed  hand  there  and  the  Pharisees  
watched  to  see  whether  He  would  heal  him.  This  is  the  one  place  in  
Scripture where we read that “Jesus was angry”. I am sure He was also 
angry  when  He  made  a  whip  in  the  temple  and  chased  out  those  who  
were  making  money  in  the  Name  of  God.  Jesus  looked  at  them  with  
anger here, because He was grieved to see the hardness of their hearts. 
He healed the man ignoring what the Pharisees thought of Him. The evil 
nature of the Pharisees becomes manifest here in that instead of rejoic-
ing over the healing of that man, they began to plan to “destroy Jesus”.
Why  did  they  want  to  destroy  Jesus?  That  man  with  the  paralysed  
hand had sat in their synagogue for so many years and those Pharisees 
could  not  heal  him.  But  here  an  unlearned  carpenter  comes  from  the  
despised  town  of  Nazareth  and  He  heals  the  man  immediately.  They  
became jealous of Jesus and realised that the people would know that 

574 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Son of God
Mark
this Preacher could help them more than the Pharisees could – and they 
would then follow Him. So they planned to destroy Him and His minis-
try. They would call Him a false prophet or a heretic. There are Christian 
Pharisees today who can become jealous of God using you, and who can 
try  to  destroy  your  ministry  or  even  your  life.  They  may  try  to  destroy  
your ministry by scandalising you or calling you a false prophet. They are 
jealous because they cannot do what God is doing through you. Beware 
of being jealous of another man’s ministry.
Let me say something about anger here. Ephesians 4:26 says, “Be angry 
but do not sin.” There is an anger that is sinful and there is an anger that 
is not sinful. We can observe anger without sin in Jesus’ life. When was 
He angry and when was He not angry? He was angry when people were 
hard-hearted  towards  other  poor  people  as  we  see  here.  He  was  also  
angry when He saw people exploiting the poor and making money in the 
temple in God’s name. But He never became angry when people called 
Him a devil, or spat on His face, or crucified Him. So, anger is sinful when 
it is a reaction to what others do or say to us – as when Paul shouted at 
the high-priest for commanding someone to slap him (Acts 23:3). Anger 
is righteous when we see God’s Name being dishonoured in the church.
With  many  Christians,  however,  it  is  exactly  the  opposite.  They  are  
angry when people harm them. But they are not angry when God’s Name 
is dishonoured. There are so many preachers in India making money in 
the  Name  of  Jesus  from  poor  people.  Are  Christians  angry  with  them?  
No. Why? Because they are not like Christ. Jesus says, “Learn from Me 
and follow Me.”
In 4:38, we read of Jesus sleeping on a cushion in the boat. A cushion 
speaks of comfort. It blesses my heart to read that Jesus did not sleep on 
the hard wooden floor of the boat but on a cushion. He was not an ascetic 
who would refuse to use a comfortable bed when it was freely available. 
Many Christians think that one is more spiritual if he sleeps on a hard 
floor. That is not spirituality – nor is it following Jesus.
In Chapter 5, we read about a demon-possessed man being delivered. 
The  demons  requested  that  they  be  permitted  to  enter  some  pigs  and  
Jesus permitted them. This man must have had at least 2000 demons 
in  him  because  they  entered  into  2000  pigs!  When  the  people  of  that  
area  saw  this  man  totally  delivered  and  sane,  instead  of  being  excited  
and  saying,  “Lord,  this  is  wonderful.  Come  and  minister  in  our  land,”  
they urged Jesus to leave immediately (verse 17). That tells us something 
about their sense of values: They valued pigs more than human beings. 
Whereas  Jesus  taught  that  one  soul  was  worth  more  than  the  whole  
world (Mark 8:36). Jesus respected their wishes and went away but told 
the saved man to be His witness in that land (verse 19).
In 6:3,  we  read  that  Jesus  had  four  brothers  –  James,  Joses,  Judas  
and Simon. He had sisters also – which means at least two. So Mary had 
at least seven children. Since we don’t hear of Joseph, it is most likely

Mark
that he had died by now. So, for many years of Jesus’ life He had to work 
as a carpenter and support a family of eight members. God allowed His 
Son to go through that experience so that Jesus could be an example to 
parents who have to struggle through difficult circumstances to bring up 
a large family. He can sympathise with their struggles (Hebrews 4:15).
In 6:4,  Jesus  said,  “A  prophet  has  honour  everywhere  except  in  his  
hometown and among his relatives in his household.” That was true in the 
1
st
 century – and it is true in the 21
st
 century too. A prophet is despised 
by his own relatives and generally not appreciated in his home-town. He 
is valued by the few godly people who know him and in other towns more 
than in his hometown. Familiarity breeds contempt. And so Jesus could 
not do many miracles in His hometown (6:5). If you don’t value a man of 
God, his ministry won’t bless you as much as it blesses others who value 
him. Because of the unbelief of the people in His hometown, Jesus could 
not do all that He wanted to do for them. We tie the hands of Jesus when 
we are unbelieving. Then He cannot do for us all that He wants to do.
Denouncing the Traditions of Men
In Chapter 7, Jesus denounced the Pharisees for valuing their traditions 
above God’s Word. This is true of most religious Christians today as well. 
This was the great conflict that Jesus had with the people of His time: 
Jesus  stood  for  God’s  Word  while  the  Pharisees  stood  for  the  tradition  
of the elders. And this is the great conflict that we find in Christendom 
today as well. Most Christians value what their forefathers have believed 
and practiced for many years and do not bother to check whether God’s 
Word teaches that or not. Jesus warned here of three steps downward if 
we hold on to religious traditions that are not found in the Word of God: 
First, it will lead to neglect of God’s commandments (verse 8). Then, we 
will set aside God’s commandments (verse 9). Finally, we will cancel out 
the Word of God altogether (verse 13). That is the danger. So check every 
religious tradition you hold with the word of God. If it is not according to 
God’s Word, throw it away, no matter how many people tell you to keep 
it. It is religious traditions that breed legalists and Pharisees even today.
Consider  our  attitude  when  it  comes  to  earthly  matters.  When  we  
are  sick,  we  don’t  go  to  the  hospital  that  our  great-grandfather  went  
to  –  because  there  are  better  and  more  modern  hospitals  today.  When  
it comes to education, we don’t send our children to the school that our 
great-grandfather went to – because there are better schools today. But 
when it comes to spiritual matters, many so-called “believers” choose the 
church their ancestors went to! Why don’t they look around and choose 
the  best  in  spiritual  matters  too?  Because,  despite  calling  themselves  
“born-again  believers”,  they  are  still  earthly-minded  and  not  spiritual.  
They want the best of all earthly things, but not spiritually. If they were 
as interested in their spiritual life as in their health and education, they 

576 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Son of God
Mark
would have looked around for the most spiritual church and joined it – 
even if it was not the one their parents went to. But how many believers 
have the courage to do that? Perhaps one in a hundred. All the rest follow 
the traditions of their elders and ancestors, just like the Pharisees did in 
Jesus’ time. And that is why they stagnate and miss the will of God for 
their lives. I want to challenge at least the young people in this genera-
tion to be bold and to break with all human traditions that are contrary 
to God’s Word. Then only will you be able to follow Jesus all the way. I am 
not here to tell you which church you should join. I would only urge you 
to join the best group of disciples that you can find in your hometown – 
whatever its label may be.
That’s what I would do. My loyalty is to Jesus Christ, and not even to 
the group of churches that the Lord has planted through us and given me 
responsibility for. I don’t believe in denominations but in individual local 
churches as we read in Revelation 1 to 3. I tell the folks in our church 
that if they move to another town and find a more spiritual church than 
the church that is in fellowship with us, in that town, then they should 
join that other church and not the one linked to us. In every locality the 
quality of a church depends on the quality of its leadership.
In 7:10, 11, Jesus spoke of the importance of helping our parents when 
they are old. Some people in those days (and even now) think that the 
spiritual thing to do is to tell their parents, “I am sorry. I am serving 
the Lord. I can’t help you in any way.” Jesus said that that amounted 
to cancelling out the word of God (verse 13). We must help our aged 
parents. You can’t tell them, “I have given my money to God and have 
nothing left to help you with.” Your service to God must include helping 
your parents. You don’t have to obey your parents after you have left 
your home and you must not allow them to hinder you from serving 
the Lord. But you must help them financially and in other practical 
ways when they are in need. You must care for them.
Three Types of Christians
Jesus  warned  His  disciples  against  three  types  of  leaven.  In  Matthew 
16:11, he warned against the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of 
the Sadducees. Here He warns them against the leaven of Herod as well. 
What are these three leavens?
The Pharisees were the evangelicals of Jesus’ time, who had all their 
doctrines correct. (Jesus Himself gave them that certificate in Matthew 
23:3). The Sadducees were the liberals of Jesus’ time, who did not believe 
in  miracles,  angels,  resurrection  etc.  The  Herodians  were  followers  of  
Herod  and  were  thoroughly  worldly.  Herod  could  enjoy  listening  to  a  
powerful message by John the Baptist and also enjoy a sensual dance by 
a scantily-clad Salome (Mark 6:20, 22). He was like the Christians who 

Three Types of Christians                                                                                                                        577
Mark
can enjoy a good sermon or a time of praise and enjoy sensual scenes in 
a movie equally wholeheartedly!!
These three types of Christians exist today too: Evangelicals, liberals 
and worldly Christians. Note however, that the ones who opposed Jesus 
the most were not the Herodians, or the Sadducees, but the Pharisees. 
The evangelicals of His time were the biggest hypocrites; and that is true 
today as well. The biggest hypocrites today are not found among worldly 
and liberal Christians, but among evangelical, fundamental Christians. 
Many fundamentalists who are proud of having all their doctrines correct, 
don’t realise how legalistic and hypocritical they are. They do not respond 
to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, and so they never become free from 
their legalism. The Lord is in conflict with such people even today – just 
as He was when He walked on earth 2000 years ago.
In 8:23–26, we find a very important teaching on healing. There Jesus 
prayed for a blind man and the man was not fully healed. Jesus asked 
him, “Do you see everything clearly?” He said, “No. I see men like trees 
walking.” If Jesus were like some preachers today, He would have told 
him, “No. You must make a positive confession. Believe that you are fully 
healed and ignore the symptoms. Confess that you are healed and only 
then will you be healed”. But Jesus didn’t tell him to say that, because 
Jesus doesn’t want anyone to tell a lie. What Jesus did was He prayed for 
him again and completed the work of healing. Why did Jesus heal him 
in this way? In every other case, He healed people with a single touch or 
word. Why was there a need for a second touch here? The Lord did this 
because  He  knew  that  in  the  20
th
  century,  “healers”  would  go  around  
teaching people that even when they are not healed they must confess 
that they are healed. Jesus did not teach us to tell lies under the pretext 
of positive confession. We are not to say that we can see clearly when we 
still  see  men  like  trees.  Don’t  be  confused  by  the  false  teaching  about  
faith that is found in Christendom today. Faith is not positive confession. 
It is confessing what God has specifically promised to me. If we are not 
healed, let us be honest and say so – and seek God for healing..
In 8:33, we see Jesus rebuking Peter with the strongest words He ever 
used to anyone: “Get behind Me, Satan.” Why did He say that? Would 
Jesus ever have to say to any of us, “Get behind Me, Satan”? We are 
not better than Peter, are we? Peter had forsaken everything to follow 
Jesus. Yet he was deceived by Satan. Who is the one who is deceived 
by Satan? If we know the answer to that question, we can be protected 
from deception. What is the mark of a man who is influenced by Satan?
Here is the answer – in the same verse. “Your mind is set on your own 
interests and not God’s interests.”
The Christian worker who will be deceived by Satan is the one whose 
mind is set on his own interests and not God’s. You may be born again 

578 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Son of God
Mark
and baptised in the Holy Spirit. But if your mind is set on your own inter-
ests and your own gain, Satan will deceive you thoroughly. His deception 
will make you imagine that you are serving God when you are not serving 
God – but only yourself. There were many people like that in Paul’s time 
who sought their own. Timothy however was one who did not seek his 
own (Philippians 2:19–21). So the way to escape deception is to ensure 
that our mind is not set on our own interests, our own gain or our own 
profit – but on God’s interests alone – all the time.
The Kingdom of God Coming With Power
In 9:1, Jesus said, “I say to you that some of you standing here will not 
taste  of  death  until  they  see  the  kingdom  of  God  after  it  has  come  with  
power.”  This  happened  on  the  day  of  Pentecost  –  and  some  who  were  
standing there when Jesus spoke those words, experienced it. The power 
of God came into 120 hearts on the day of Pentecost (Acts 1:8) when the 
Holy Spirit brought the kingdom of God to earth (Romans 14:17). Jesus 
defined the day of Pentecost here as the kingdom of God or the govern-
ment  of  God  coming  to  earth  with  power.  That  is  what  the  church  is  
supposed to be – a small pocket of the kingdom of God manifesting the 
power of God, in the midst of the kingdom of the devil.
In Chapter 9, we see three disciples with Jesus on the mount where 
Jesus was transfigured. When Peter saw Moses and Elijah, he was 
excited and said “Let’s make three tabernacles here for Jesus, Moses 
and Elijah” (verse 5). Immediately a cloud covered all of them and God 
spoke  from  heaven  saying,  “Don’t  put  My  Son  on  the  same  level  as  
Moses and Elijah. This is My Son. Listen to Him.” What is the message 
here for us? However much we are blessed by a man of God, we must 
never allow him to come between us and the Lord. Our vision of Jesus 
must always be clear. The moment a man comes between us and the 
Lord, a cloud will come in our relationship with Christ. Why is it that 
the vision of so many believers is so cloudy today? Because they are 
looking at a man of God and not at Jesus. They are listening to a man 
and not to Jesus. We must certainly respect men of God, but we must 
run the race “looking at Jesus alone” (verse 8).
In 9:20–29,  we  see  how  a  father’s  faith  brought  deliverance  to  his  
son  who  was  demon-possessed.  The  disciples  asked  Jesus  why  they  
couldn’t cast out the demon. Jesus replied and said, “Because you did 
not have faith; and you did not have faith because you did not fast and 
pray.” (Matthew 17:20, 21). There are different degrees of strength in the 
demons and some demons can be cast out only if we are strong enough in 
faith through fasting and prayer. I can’t explain that. I’ve never been able 
to explain the logic of prayer or of fasting. But I know it works. I simply 
believe what Jesus said and obey Him.

The Seriousness of Sin                                                                                                                             579
Mark
The Seriousness of Sin
In 9:43–48, Jesus said, “If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it 
is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go 
into hell, into the unquenchable fire.... If your foot causes you to stumble, 
cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame, than, having your two feet, 
to be cast into hell.... If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is 
better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two 
eyes, to be cast into hell.” Jesus spoke about Hell more than anyone else, 
because  He  alone  had  seen  the  reality  of  Hell.  He  said  that  Hell  was  a  
place where the fire and the worm never die. If anyone asks, “How can 
worms not die in a fire?”, my reply is, “I don’t want to find out. Those who 
go to Hell can find out for themselves.” Jesus warned those who sinned 
with their hands and their eyes that they could go to hell if they didn’t 
stop sinning. He knew the dangers sinful people faced more than anyone 
else did. Every true servant of God will preach about Hell, because Jesus 
did. We don’t have to understand everything about Hell. It is a reality and 
so we must warn people against it.
In 9:49, Jesus said, “Everybody must be salted with fire.” I understand 
that verse to mean that everyone must have one of two fires – either the 
fire of heaven or the fire of hell. You can have your choice. I’ve chosen the 
fire of heaven. John the Baptist said something similar when He prophe-
sied that Jesus would baptise people with fire and also burn up the chaff 
in unquenchable fire (Matthew 3:11, 12).
In 10:17, we read of a rich, young ruler who wanted to follow Jesus. 
Jesus diagnosed his case as a serious lover of money and told him, “You 
must first give away all your money to the poor.” Jesus didn’t say such 
words to everyone. Zaccheus gave away only half his money to the poor 
and Jesus accepted that (Luke 19). Mary and Martha had a house and 
Jesus never told them to sell their house (John 12). Why this difference? 
Because the love of money is like a cancer. In some people, the cancer 
has  spread  so  widely  that  a  whole  bodily  organ  has  to  be  removed.  In  
others,  chemotherapy  can  remove  the  cancer.  In  Zaccheus  the  cancer  
had not spread as much as in this rich ruler. And in Mary and Martha 
the cancer was minimal. The Lord doesn’t tell everyone to give away all 
their money – but only where He sees that the cancer is deeply-rooted. 
Then Jesus told His disciples, “It is easier for a camel to go through the 
eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter God’s kingdom” (10:25). The 
kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of earth are poles apart. We cannot 
choose both. We have to choose one. Jesus went on to say that only God 
could save a man from the love of money (10:27).
Faith
In 11:22–24, Jesus taught about faith. When we see a mountain in our 
way,  that  is  not  necessarily  an  indication  that  we  should  turn  back.  

580 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Son of God
Mark
It  could  be  a  challenge  to  our  faith.  God  may  want  us  to  remove  that  
mountain and move forward to do His will (verse 23). 
There are two amazing statements in Mark’s gospel. When put together, 
the truth is staggering: 
“All things are possible with God” (Mark 10:27).
“All things are possible to him who believes” (Mark 9:23).
All believers believe the first of these two statements. But it is faith 
in the second statement that brings the power of God into our life and 
ministry. We have all got to confess that we lack faith tremendously. It 
is faith that we need to seek for, because “without faith it is impossible to 
please God” (Hebrews 11:6). Faith can make all the difference in our life 
and ministry.
Jesus  then  mentioned  one  of  the  greatest  hindrances  to  faith  –  an  
unforgiving spirit (11:25, 26). If there is even one human being anywhere 
on the face of the earth whom we have not forgiven, that will rob us of 
faith and even our salvation.
In 12:17, Jesus taught that we must clear our debts to man before we 
can  give  anything  to  God:  “(First)  Render  to  Caesar  the  things  that  are  
Caesar’s, and (then) to God the things that are God’s.” God doesn’t want 
us to give Him Caesar’s money or anyone else’s money. We must clear 
our debts to man first.
In 12:42–44,  we  read  of  a  widow  who  put  two  copper  coins  into  the  
offering-box.  Jesus  was  sitting  near  the  treasury  watching  how  people  
were giving money (12:41). He was not watching how much they put in, 
but how they put in. In the old covenant the important question was how 
much. Ten percent. In the new covenant, however, it is how we give that 
matters. Do we give cheerfully and sacrificially as this widow did? That 
is what the Lord looks for.
In 14:34–36, Jesus tells Peter, James and John in Gethsemane, “My 
soul is deeply grieved to the point of death”. He then fell down to the 
ground  and  prayed  saying,  “Abba!  Father!  All  things  are  possible  for  
You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will.” 
What was the cup that Jesus shrank from? It was not physical death, 
for He was braver than any Christian martyr. What Jesus dreaded was 
the break of fellowship with His Father that would take place when He 
took the punishment for our sins on the cross. He had had unbroken 
fellowship with His Father from all eternity. But now for three hours 
that  fellowship  would  be  broken  on  the  cross.  In  His  human  weak-
ness, He asked His Father if there wasn’t any other way. He prayed for 
perhaps three hours, sweating great drops of blood, for His agony was 
so great. He could have gone back to heaven from Gethsemane, for He 
had  never  sinned.  But  His  love  for  you  and  me  prevented  Him  from  
doing that. And so He went to the cross. 

Faith                                                                                                                                                            581
Mark
Then we read in 15:33, 34 that He faced the wrath of God for our sin – 
being forsaken by His Father and enduring the pains of an eternity in hell 
concentrated into three hours. This was the only time He ever addressed 
His Father as God – because He was now hanging before the Judge of 
the universe. And then the work was finished – and His last cry was His 
committing Himself again to His Father with whom fellowship had been 
restored (15:37). And the veil of the temple was torn indicating that the 
way was now open for us to enter into the Father’s presence too (15:38). 
Hallelujah for such a Saviour!
In 16:7, we see the angel sending a message from the Lord to “His disci-
ples and Peter...”. Why does he say “and Peter”? Wasn’t Peter also one of 
Jesus’ disciples? This is very precious. Peter would never have believed 
that  any  message  sent  to  Jesus’  disciples  could  possibly  include  him,  
because  he  was  certain  that  because  he  had  denied  the  Lord,  he  was  
permanently disqualified from being an apostle. That was why the Lord 
very tenderly included that phrase “and Peter...” – to assure him that the 
invitation to meet with the Lord was for him too. And that is how the Lord 
speaks today also to those who have failed Him. He calls you especially 
to come to Him. The invitation is for you as well.
In 16:14 we see Jesus again reproving His disciples “for their unbelief 
and hardness of heart”. Seven times in the gospel records we see Jesus 
rebuking His disciples for their unbelief. He reproved them for unbelief 
more than for anything else. What he longed to see in them was faith. 
And that is what He longs to see in us too.
In 16:15–18, we see the Lord commanding His disciples to go into all 
the world and preach the gospel to every human being. We have already 
seen  the  commission  He  gave  them  in  Matthew  28  to  make  disciples  
in every nation. These two commissions are like two sides of one coin. 
Here the emphasis is on evangelism and the Lord promises to confirm 
the word of the evangelist with supernatural miracles. And He is doing 
that even today wherever the gospel is being preached for the first time 
(as in Acts). In Matthew 28, the emphasis was on making disciples and 
teaching them to keep all His commandments. That refers to building the 
church as the Body of Christ. The great tragedy today is that Christians 
have separated what God has joined together – these two commissions. 
Evangelism without disciple-making is a one-sided coin – and therefore 
a counterfeit coin. 
God  intended  evangelists  to  bring  their  converts  into  local  churches  
where they could be made into disciples. That is why the evangelist must 
work along with the apostle, prophet, teacher and shepherd to build the 
Body of Christ (Ephesians 4:11). That is how they worked together in the 
first century. But unfortunately, it is rare to see that type of cooperation 
in  today’s  Christendom.  And  that  is  why  the  Christian  church  has  so  
many shallow converts today. 

582 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Son of God
Mark
The  evangelist  is  like  a  person  who  goes  to  the  quarry  and  cuts  out  
stones  and  brings  them  to  the  building  site.  The  other  four  ministries  
are  to  then  build  these  stones  into  a  holy  temple  for  the  Lord  to  dwell  
in. Which of these ministries is more important? All five are required. 
No-one can do it all by himself. The evangelist’s ministry is a difficult 
and  dangerous  one  –  and  so  you  should  not  enter  into  this  ministry  
unless God has called you for it. But you should not criticise the masons 
who  are  building  those  stones  into  a  building,  imagining  that  they  are  
having an easier work than you. If they also join you in the quarry, the 
temple of the Lord will never be built. Each of us must fulfil the task God 
has  assigned  to  us.  If  all  the  emphasis  is  given  to  evangelism,  we  will  
have piles of stones everywhere without any temple, without any living 
expression of Christ’s Body. So let us ask the Lord to help us to fulfil our 
specific calling in relation to these two great commissions. Amen.

LUKE
Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
L
uke’s burden is to give us, as far as possible, an accurate record of 
everything right from the time of Jesus coming into Mary’s womb all 
the way to His resurrection, and to some extent what followed after 
His resurrection (1:3).
Luke was the only writer in the New Testament who was not a Jew. He 
wrote the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. The other 25 books 
of the New Testament were all written by Jews. (In the Old Testament, 
except for the book of Job, all the other 38 books were written by Jews). 
Luke  was  a  Greek  who  wrote  these  two  books  to  Theophilus  who  was  
also a Greek. It was a Greek man writing to a Greek man trying to show 
how Jesus came to earth as a Man and how He lived and fulfilled God’s 
purposes.
The Ministry of the Holy Spirit
Luke  speaks  much  about  the  ministry  of  the  Holy  Spirit  in  the  two  
books that he wrote. In fact, this is one of his major emphases. Look 
at these examples in this gospel: John the Baptist would be filled with 
the Holy Spirit from the womb (1:15). Mary would have the Holy Spirit 
come upon her (1:35). Elizabeth and Zachariah were filled with the Holy 
Spirit (1:41, 67). Simeon had the Holy Spirit upon him, he got revelation 
from the Holy Spirit and was led by the Spirit to the temple (2:25–27). 
Jesus baptises  in  the  Holy  Spirit  (3:16).  Jesus  was  praying  when  He  
was  baptised  (obviously  for  the  anointing  of  the  Holy  Spirit)  and  the  
Spirit came upon Him immediately (3:21, 22). Jesus was full of the Spirit 
and led by the Spirit into the wilderness and returned in the power of 
the Spirit (4:1, 14). Jesus proclaims that the Holy Spirit was upon Him 
(4:18). The Holy Spirit is given to those who ask for Him (11:13). Jesus 
commands His disciples to wait for the power of the Holy Spirit (24:49). 

584 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
In the Acts of the Apostles, Luke mentions the Holy Spirit more than 50 
times. Luke was undoubtedly a Spirit-filled man and was excited about 
this new-covenant life that was made possible through the gift of the 
Holy Spirit. I wonder how many Christians are as excited as he was.
The baptism in the Holy Spirit is mentioned at the beginning of each 
of the first five books of the New Testament. This teaches us the tremen-
dous importance of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in this new covenant 
age. So, if there is one thing that the devil will seek to counterfeit, it will 
be the baptism in the Holy Spirit; and we see plenty of those counterfeits 
today.
How  does  the  devil  ensure  that  believers  will  never  get  baptised  in  the  
Holy Spirit? 
First of all, by giving some of them a physical or emotional experience. 
They  lack  the  power  to  overcome  sin  and  to  serve  the  Lord.  But  Satan  
assures them that they have been baptised in the Holy Spirit. Such believ-
ers will never again seek for the baptism in the Holy Spirit, because they 
are  convinced  that  they  have  already  received  it.  There  are  millions  of  
Christians like this everywhere. They are defeated by sin, they love money 
and they live for the world. But they speak some gibberish which they call 
“tongues” and claim to be getting unusual physical and visual experiences. 
Secondly, Satan gets some other believers (who are at the opposite pole 
doctrinally  on  the  baptism  of  the  Spirit)  to  react  against  these  obvious  
counterfeits and to stay away from the baptism of the Spirit altogether. 
Thus  he  succeeds  in  ensuring  that  both  groups  of  believers  (and  that  
constitutes the vast majority of believers) never receive the genuine power 
of God and the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
Be careful and avoid both these groups.
How was John filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother’s womb? Did 
he tarry for the Spirit in his mother’s womb as a foetus? Did somebody 
exhort him inside the womb to pray? No. God filled him. It is God’s work 
to fill you with the Holy Spirit. If we submit to Him, He will fill us. Here is 
something that will stimulate your faith: If God can fill a helpless foetus 
in a mother’s womb with the Holy Spirit, why can’t He fill you? 
Don’t be satisfied with any cheap counterfeit. I told the Lord when I 
was a young man that I would never be satisfied with a counterfeit 
and would be willing to wait ten years if necessary to get the genuine 
experience. It was worth waiting. When you are genuinely baptised in 
the Spirit, it will change your whole way of life. 
When John was filled with the Holy Spirit, he became great in the sight 
of the Lord (1:15). This is what the Spirit wants to make us too – great in 
God’s sight, not man’s.

The Ministry of the Holy Spirit                                                                                                               585
Luke
In 1:34, 35, we read that when Gabriel came to Mary, she quite natu-
rally asked him, “How can this be? I am a virgin. How can a virgin have 
a baby?” The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the 
power  of  the  Most  High  will  overshadow  you.”  The  Holy  Spirit  always  
brings the power of God to us (See Acts 1:8 and 10:38).
As  the  Spirit  of  God  came  on  Mary  to  produce  Jesus  in  her,  so  the  
Spirit comes upon us primarily to produce Christ in us. That is the clear-
est guideline you can have to understand the ministry of the Holy Spirit 
in our life and in our service for the Lord. As it took time for that body to 
grow inside Mary’s womb, it will take time for Christ to become manifest 
in our lives too.
In 1:37, we see a lovely promise, “Nothing will be impossible with God.” 
(“No  word  that  God  speaks  will  be  without  power.”)  If  God  has  spoken  
a word, you can be sure that there is power in it. When God said, “Let 
there be light”, something happened. We see that throughout Genesis 1. 
No word from God is powerless. This is why it is important that we study 
God’s Word and claim its promises. Here is a powerful promise: “Sin shall 
not rule over you” (Romans 6:14). That will become true in your life, if you 
believe it, for no word from God can be powerless.
God wants us to believe that everything is possible for Him. That was 
why He stated this at the beginning of both the Old and New Testaments 
(See Genesis 18:14 and Luke 1:37). When we begin our Christian life 
our faith in the Bible as God’s Word may be blind faith. But it should 
not remain as blind faith. If we claim the promises of Scripture, we can 
prove in our life that nothing is impossible with God. Then our faith 
that the Bible is God’s Word will become a proven faith, for we would 
have tasted and experienced that no word of God is powerless. 
Jesus  never  questioned  the  Old  Testament.  He  was  not  bothered  by  
what all the critics and theologians said. He believed it and He experi-
enced its power. Today, the devil is leading so many people astray from 
such simple faith. Instead of believing God’s Word and thus experiencing 
power,  they  go  use  their  cleverness,  and  try  to  analyse  Scripture  and  
waste their entire lives without once experiencing the power of God. How 
do you want to live? Do you want to live analysing Scripture or experienc-
ing the power of God through it? The choice is yours.
Mary submitted to God’s Word and said, “Let it be done to me according 
to Your word.” (1:38). I am a great admirer of Mary (even though I am not a 
Roman Catholic) because she was such a godly young woman. God looked 
all over Israel to find one young woman who was really godly; and He 
found Mary, who was probably only about 18 years old at that time. Read 
Luke 1:46–55 and see how mature she is and how steeped in Scripture her 
song is. It is amazing how mature one can become even by the age of 18, 
if a person is God-fearing. God doesn’t make any mistakes in the persons 

586 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
He chooses. Mary knew that everyone in Nazareth would spread scandal-
ous stories about her when they knew she was pregnant. No-one would 
believe that this was the work of the Holy Spirit. And she was willing to 
suffer that reproach – to bring forth the body of Jesus from her body.
Now apply that to your life. Do you want to build the body of Christ 
in your town? Do you want honour for that or are you willing to suffer 
“the reproach of Christ”. God does not support those who seek for honour 
in His work. Such people will only build a congregation, not the body of 
Christ. Building the body of Christ will always bring reproach, misunder-
standing, wagging tongues and gossip – as Mary faced in Nazareth. But 
all that didn’t bother her. She still brought forth the body of Christ. And 
so it is even today. The body of Christ will come forth where people are 
willing  to  “go  outside  the  religious  camp  of  denominational  Christendom  
and bear His reproach”.
The Remnant in the First Century
Notice here that Zacharias and Mary asked the angel almost the same 
question: “How can this be?” (1:18, 34). Why then was Zacharias struck 
dumb as a punishment and not Mary? Because of two reasons. First of 
all,  Zacharias  had  an  example  before  him  of  an  older  couple  who  had  
a child – Abraham and Sarah. So there was no excuse for his unbelief. 
Mary, however, did not have any example before her of a virgin conceiving 
and  giving  birth  to  a  child.  Secondly,  Zacharias  was  a  leader  who  had  
studied the Scriptures for many years. Mary was a young girl. To whom 
more is given, from them more will be required. If you are an older person 
and a leader, God will expect more from you than from a young person. 
If you have even one example in front of you and you have not followed 
him, you will be more guilty than someone else who has no example to 
follow. The people under the law had no example to follow. But today we 
have an example in Jesus. So more will be required from us.
In 1:74,  we  read  Zacharias  prophesying  saying,  “Now  the  Lord  has  
come to grant that we will be delivered from the hand of our enemies and 
serve Him without fear.” Those enemies are our sins which enslaved us. 
Now Jesus has come to deliver us from all of them. The Holy Spirit has 
come to deliver us from all our enemies and to enable us to serve God 
without any fear. Throughout the 1500 years of the old covenant, Israel 
served  God  out  of  fear  –  a  fear  that  if  they  didn’t  obey  God,  He  would  
punish them with sickness, madness, poverty, etc. (Deuteronomy 28:15–
68).  Zacharias  prophesied  that  a  new  age  was  dawning  where  people  
would serve God out of love and not out of fear. Have you entered into 
that life? Do you serve God out of love alone?
God announced the birth of His Son to only four groups of people who 
came to see the baby Jesus – some poor shepherds, some wise men from 
Persia, an old Spirit-filled man (Simeon) and an old praying woman (Anna). 
These  were  all  very  different  types  of  people,  of  different  ages  and  from

different countries – but they were all humble, God-fearing people. And 
they are a picture of the remnant that God is preparing all over the world 
today for the second coming of His Son. The great Bible-scholars and the 
proud preachers of today remain ignorant of the times in which we live, 
just like Annas, Caiaphas and the scribes and Pharisees, 2000 years ago.
It is interesting to note that out of these four groups of people, three 
of them are significant for their activity at  night.  The  shepherds  were  
watching their flocks at night. The wise men travelled at night watching 
the  star.  (They  could  not  travel  during  the  day,  because  the  stars  are  
visible only at night). Anna was fasting and praying at night. Those who 
are a part of the remnant today are also people who seek God in the night 
seasons.  When  others  are  sleeping,  they  are  seeking  God.  God  reveals  
things to them that He never reveals to lazy Christians who are looking 
only for a comfortable life on earth.
If you want to be a part of God’s powerful remnant who have under-
standing of the times in which they live, who get revelation from heaven, 
then  seek  God  wholeheartedly,  study  His  word,  and  break  with  human  
traditions. The Lord will then show you (like He showed Simeon) things 
that others never see. You may be a non-Christian. God will give you reve-
lation too just like He gave to those wise men. Jesus revealed Himself to 
Sadhu Sundar Singh in a vision, because he sought God earnestly as a 
14-year-old boy. He was like one of those wise men from the east who had 
no knowledge of Christ or the Scriptures, but who sought God and found 
Him. God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him even today.
The Birth and Baptism of Jesus
We read in 2:7 that Jesus was born in Bethlehem. This was prophesied in 
the Old Testament. And so when the time for His birth came, God made 
Caesar, in Rome, to pass an order that everyone in Israel should go to 
their hometown for a census. So Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem. 
This was no doubt inconvenient for them, for they had to travel the 100 
kilometres  from  Nazareth  to  Bethlehem  on  a  donkey.  By  the  time  they  
arrived in Bethlehem there was no room in any of the inns there. 
Would it have been difficult for almighty God (who had all eternity to 
plan the birth of Jesus) to keep a room empty for them when they arrived 
in  Bethlehem?  Not  at  all.  He  who  runs  the  universe  could  easily  have  
arranged that. But He wanted His Son to be born in a cowshed and to 
be laid as a baby in a manger (the little trough that cows eat from). God 
might even have delayed them on their journey so that by the time they 
reached Bethlehem, all the rooms in the hotels were full. God’s delays are 
all part of His plan – Jesus had to be born in a cowshed.
Think  of  the  shame  of  being  born  in  a  cowshed.  I  have  never  met  a  
human being who was born in a cowshed. But Jesus had come to serve 
all humanity. And so He had to go underneath all men – so that no-one 
would ever feel that he was too low for Jesus to lift him up.

588 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
We must understand a principle here – because this is how we are to 
serve the Lord too. He who goes to serve others in Jesus’ Name must go 
below them if he is to serve them effectively.
But many of today’s famous preachers are quite different. They seek 
to live at a higher standard than others and collect money from people 
to do so. To meet them, one has to go through their secretaries first. Did 
Jesus have a secretary through whom you had to go, if you wanted to 
meet Him? No. Jesus was a servant of all men – and servants don’t have 
secretaries. It is kings who have secretaries. Jesus was accessible to all 
people at all times. You could go to Him directly any time you wanted. 
Nicodemus could go and see Him at night. 
If you want to serve God, make Jesus your example – and don’t follow 
the examples of the preachers of today. Go below everyone and remain 
there. Jesus started there at birth and that is where He was at the end of 
His life too – washing the feet of His disciples, as a servant. He was born 
in a dirty cowshed and died on a shameful cross. May the Lord help us to 
go the way our Saviour went, all our life. No matter how much God uses 
you, remain a servant, ever ready to wash the feet of others, till the end 
of your life.
I am certain that Mary did not complain about the difficult circum-
stances she found herself in, in that cowshed. Imagine if Mary had been 
like  some  of  the  spoilt  teenagers  today.  She  would  have  been  yelling  
at  Joseph  saying,  “I  told  you  we  should  have  started  our  journey  two  
days  earlier.  Here  we  are  now  without  any  room  available.  I  have  no  
privacy at all – and I have to deliver my baby in this cowshed with all this 
filth around me. What an irresponsible husband you are,” etc. Can you 
imagine Jesus being born into an atmosphere of complaining and grum-
bling like that? God would not have permitted that. So He needed a girl 
who would not complain. That was why He chose Mary to be the mother 
of Jesus – one who had learnt in her youth to be content with poverty and 
difficult circumstances. And that was why God could not choose any of 
the other girls in Israel.
In 2:34, 35, we read Simeon’s prophecy: “This Child is appointed for the 
fall and rise of many people in Israel and for a sign to be opposed. A sword 
will pierce your own soul to the end that the thoughts of many hearts will 
be revealed.” He was revealing the type of ministry that Jesus would have. 
That is important for us to see also, because the church has to have a 
similar ministry. The church is called the body of Christ, because it is to 
continue the ministry that Jesus began in His earthly days. As He was a 
servant of all men, we too are called to be servants of all. Church-leaders 
must be the greatest examples of servanthood on earth. Simeon said that 
Jesus would be a sign that would be opposed. If you are a leader in the 
body of Christ today, you too will be opposed as Jesus was. And it is reli-
gious people like Pharisees who will oppose you. But, as they oppose you, 
the thoughts of their hearts will be revealed (verse 35). Those Pharisees

Luke
will discover what a lot of jealousy there is in them, when they see Jesus’ 
ministry. When God blesses a man’s ministry today, many others will see 
what a lot of jealousy there is in their hearts.
In 2:47–52,  we  read  of  the  time  when  Jesus  went  to  Jerusalem,  and  
Joseph and Mary left Him behind in the temple. At the age of 12, Jesus 
knew  the  Scriptures  better  than  all  the  scholars  in  Israel.  They  were  
amazed at His explanations of the Scripture. Jesus did not have a Bible 
at  home.  There  were  no  printed  Bibles  in  those  days  and  it  was  very  
expensive to have a handwritten scroll of the Old Testament. No-one had 
one at home. How then did Jesus know the Scriptures by the age of 12? 
He listened carefully when it was read in the synagogue and in the school.
Today, we have the printed Bible in our homes – and many of us have 
many  versions  of  it  too.  Yet,  most  Christians  today  know  so  little  of  
the Bible. You can’t build the body of Christ if you don’t study God’s 
Word. Even Jesus had to study the Scriptures from childhood in order 
to serve His Father.
If  you  are  too  lazy  to  study  the  Scriptures,  I  am  sure  that  God  will  
never use you. But if you are diligent to study the Scriptures and seek to 
be filled with the Spirit, God will use you mightily. So from your earliest 
days when you are converted get into the habit of meditating on God’s 
Word.  Thus  you  will  know  God’s  mind  and  God’s  ways.  People  study  
so  diligently  to  pass  earthly  examinations!  They  also  work  diligently  to  
promote  their  business!  If  Christians  had  even  5%  of  that  diligence  to  
study the Word of God, their lives would have been so effective for God. 
Don’t study the Bible as a text book in an academic way. Seek to know 
God through His Word.
In 2:49,  we  see  something  else  in  Jesus  which  is  as  an  example  for  
us. He had a great burden and passion for “the Father’s business” (KJV). 
Many preachers study God’s Word to gain honour as preachers, and not 
to do the Father’s business. We must know God through His Word and 
we must have a passion for His work. Otherwise, we will waste our life 
on earth. We were sent to earth to do a work for God. It doesn’t matter 
if we have to live in a hut or a palace. It doesn’t matter whether we get 
martyred for Christ’s sake or whether we die a natural death. We must 
complete our Father’s business before we leave this earth.
In 3:1, 2, we read of the ministry of John the Baptist. It is interesting 
to read what is written here; Tiberius Caesar was the greatest man in the 
world at that time. Pontius Pilate was the greatest man in Judea. Herod 
was the greatest man in Galilee. Philip was the greatest man in Ituraea 
and Trachonitis. Lysanias was the greatest man in Abilene. Annas and 
Caiaphas  were  the  greatest  men  in  religious  Israel.  But  the  word  from  
God bypassed all of them and came to an unknown man in the wilder-
ness called John the Baptist. 

590 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
It is the same today. The word from God will bypass all the great men 
of the world and all the great theologians in Christendom and will come 
to you, if you will be like John the Baptist – longing to decrease so that 
Christ  might  increase  (John  3:30),  willing  to  be  an  unknown  voice  in  
the  wilderness  (3:4). John  the  Baptist  was  not  in  a  hurry  to  preach.  
He waited until God’s time came. “He was in the desert until the day of 
his public appearance” (Luke 1:80). One day God said, “All right, John. 
I’ve  taught  you  enough.  Go  and  preach  now.”  And  he  went  forth  and  
preached. He never did a single miracle (John 10:41). Yet all Judea went 
out to the wilderness to hear him, because God was with him (Matthew 
3:5).  People  will  come  from  everywhere  to  hear  a  man  who  knows  God  
and who speaks His mind.
In 3:8–13, we see that John the Baptist’s ministry was fiery and very 
practical. He did not baptise everybody who came to him. He had discern-
ment, and when he discerned that some like the Pharisees had not really 
repented, he refused to baptise them. He kept the standards high in his 
preaching,  because  he  was  not  interested  in  numbers  but  in  quality. 
He was not enslaved to any mission board by having to send reports to 
them. He gave some “down-to-earth” practical advice to all who asked – 
whether tax collectors or soldiers. “Don’t exploit people”, he told them. 
His  preaching  was  not  theoretical,  analysing  Old  Testament  verses.  It  
was  practical.  The  teaching  of  Jesus  and  the  apostles  too  was  always  
practical.  Many  preachers  have  been  taught  in  Bible-schools  that  the  
best preaching is expository – explaining the whole Bible verse by verse. 
But we never see Jesus or any of the apostles, prophets or teachers in the 
Bible doing that. They always preached topically with occasional expla-
nations  of  some  Old  Testament  verse.  Let  me  encourage  you  to  follow  
the  example  of  Jesus  and  the  apostles  in  your  teaching  –  and  not  the  
 opinions of today’s Bible-scholars.
In 3:21,  22,  we  read  about  the  baptism  of  Jesus  and  how  the  Holy  
Spirit came upon Him. If John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit 
from his mother’s womb, Jesus was too. He overcame temptation for 30 
years  through  the  Spirit’s  power.  Yet  we  read  here  that  the  Holy  Spirit  
came upon  Him  when  He  was  30  years  old  and  anointed  Him  for  His  
ministry (See Acts 10:38). Many argue saying that since we are born of 
the Spirit, there is no need of any second experience of the Spirit. But 
Jesus was born of the Spirit too in Mary’s womb. He had the Holy Spirit 
in Him for 30 years. Yet He needed to be anointed with the Holy Spirit 
before He began His ministry.
The Holy Spirit is God, and so we cannot fully explain His work in us, by 
using theological terms. To try and explain the ministry of the Holy Spirit 
fully would be as foolish as one dog trying to explain human behaviour to 
another dog!! All that a dog may be able to say to another is this: “I don’t 
know anything about human psychology. But I do know that my master 
is  very  kind  to  me.  He  takes  good  care  of  me  –  and  I  am  very  happy.”  

Miracles and Teaching                                                                                                                             591
Luke
That  dog  can  experience  his  master’s  goodness,  but  he  cannot  explain 
his master’s psychology. So it is with us and the Holy Spirit. We cannot 
explain His activity fully. But we can experience His love, His goodness 
and  His  power  –  and  that  is  enough.  The  distance  between  God  (the  
Creator) and man is far greater than the distance between two created 
beings – man and a dog. So it is impossible for us to be able to explain all 
of the Spirit’s workings.
We read that Jesus was praying when He was being baptised (3:21). 
What for? Obviously, to be anointed with the Holy Spirit. We know that, 
because His prayers were always answered immediately – and we see the 
Holy Spirit coming upon Him as soon as He came up out of the water. So 
we see that even Jesus received the anointing only in answer to prayer. 
This is the way for us too. If we acknowledge that we do not have God’s 
power (Acts 1:8) and that rivers of living water are not flowing out through 
us (John 7:38) and seek God in prayer, He will fill us also with His Spirit 
(Luke 11:13) – and then we too will be able to accomplish a mighty minis-
try for God on earth.
In 3:28–33,  we  have  the  genealogy  of  Mary.  In  verse  23,  it  says  that  
Jesus was supposedly, “the son of Joseph, the son of Eli”. The word ‘son’ 
in italics indicates that the word is not in the original Greek. We know 
from Matthew 1:7, 16 that Joseph’s father’s name was Jacob, not Eli. Eli 
was obviously his father-in-law – Mary’s father. Further proof of this is 
seen in the fact that the genealogy in Luke traces the line from David’s 
son Nathan (3:31) and not from his son Solomon (see Matthew 1:7). Luke’s 
genealogy goes all the way to Adam because Luke is writing to non-Jews.
In 4:1–14 we read that after Jesus was tempted (see Matthew 4:1–10), 
He came in the power of the Spirit and preached. Overcoming temptation 
equips  us  to  preach  God’s  Word  with  power.  In  the  synagogue,  Jesus  
read Isaiah 61 and said that the prophecy was now fulfilled. 
The Spirit of God anointed Him to bless others – to preach the gospel 
to others, to release others from prison, to open the eyes of others, and to 
set others free. Every result of the anointing was for others. 
The fruit of the Spirit is for ourselves – love, joy, peace, longsuffering, 
gentleness,  goodness,  faithfulness,  meekness  and  self-control.  But  the  
gifts of the Spirit are all for others. If God gives you the gift of preaching or 
healing, it is to bless others with – and not for you to make money or get 
honour for yourself. Even the gift of tongues is meant to enable you to be 
constantly fresh so that you can bless others. If you use a gift of the Spirit 
for yourself, you will only build Babylon with it. Remember that always.
Miracles and Teaching
In 5:1–11 we read of a miraculous catch of fish. Jesus told Simon to go 
out into the sea and cast his nets for a catch. Simon had already tried 
all of the previous night and caught nothing. But He decided – without 

592 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
much faith – to obey the Lord. And he caught the biggest catch of fish he 
had ever got in his whole life. When the Lord tells us to do something, we 
may say, “Lord, I’ve tried that so many times. But it didn’t work.” But the 
Lord says, “But do it now because I tell you to do it.” You will be surprised 
at the results you see. It is best to go to places the Lord tells you to go to 
and not elsewhere. If you go where you like, you will not see eternal fruit. 
But if you go led by the Lord, you will see fruit that lasts forever. So let 
God tell you where to go – and when.
In 5:15, 16, we read that large crowds came to hear Jesus and to be 
healed of their sicknesses. (When studying the Scriptures, it is good at 
times, to place ourselves in that situation and consider what we would 
have  done  there).  If  you  had  seen  such  results  in  your  ministry,  what  
would you be in danger of? Pride. Jesus was tempted like us. What did he 
do? “He would often slip away into the wilderness to pray” (5:16). While 
other people were sitting around and talking, He would slip away to get 
alone  with  His  Father  and  to  pray.  Develop  that  habit  in  your  life.  Get  
alone with God. It’s good to be with people. But you need to have plenty 
of times when you are alone with God. The more your ministry spreads, 
the more you need time to get alone with God. This was something He 
would often do, not just once in a while.
In  5:27–29,  we  read  of  Matthew  (Levi)  being  called  by  Jesus  and  
arranging a big feast for the Lord. If you compare this with what Matthew 
himself wrote about this feast in his gospel, you will see that he doesn’t 
say a word about the fact that it was he who arranged this great feast 
(Matthew 9:9, 10). If you do something good, let other people report on it, 
and not you yourself.
In 6:12, 13, we see how Jesus called His disciples. He prayed all night – 
because He wanted to be clear in His mind as to whom to choose. Even a 
sinless Jesus needed to pray to know the Father’s will. Let me also point 
out here that Judas Iscariot was not a crook when Jesus chose him. It 
says in 6:16 that Judas Iscariot “became a traitor.” He was not a traitor 
when he was chosen. He became a traitor later. When he was selected, 
he  was  as  wholehearted  and  sincere  as  Peter,  James  and  John.  Jesus  
chose a wholehearted sincere man who later became crooked and went 
to hell.
In 6:20–49,  we  have  the  sermon  on  the  mount  in  condensed  form.  
Those who are serving the Lord in difficult situations where they are 
persecuted,  misunderstood,  criticised,  harassed,  humiliated,  insulted  
and physically assaulted can remember these words of our Lord and be 
comforted: “Blessed are you when men hate you, and ostracize you, and 
insult you, and scorn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man. Be 
glad in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. 
For in the same way their fathers used to treat the prophets” (6:22, 23). 
Do you believe that you are blessed when men hate you and won’t have 
anything to do with you and scorn your very name? This could be your 

Miracles and Teaching                                                                                                                             593
Luke
relatives, other Christians, non-Christians, your neighbours or anyone. 
If they reject you because you are a disciple of Jesus, and proclaim the 
whole counsel of God, you are so blessed that Jesus said that you should 
jump for joy. That is the time to “dance in the Spirit”. Why is it then that 
many Christians seek for popularity and honour? Jesus your Bridegroom 
was hated, insulted and ostracised. Why is His bride not willing to stand 
with her Bridegroom?
If,  on  the  other  hand,  all  the  people  praise  you  and  say  nice  things  
about you, that probably proves that you are a false prophet – because 
false prophets in the Old Testament were always honoured and praised. 
False prophets are always praised and honoured, and true prophets are 
always criticised and rejected – in every century. 
How should we treat these people? 6:27 says, “Love them and do good 
to them. Pray for them”. I pray for my persecutors like this: “Lord, please 
give  me  an  opportunity  to  serve  them  and  to  do  good  to  them,  so  that  
they will know that for all the evil they have done to me, I love them in 
return with the love of God. I am even willing to help them financially 
if they are in need. I want to show them that my kingdom is not of this 
world.” We belong to a kingdom which is full of love. There is not an atom 
of hatred there and so we can bless all who curse us (6:28).
You cannot live this life if you are not filled with the Holy Spirit. When 
people mistreat you, it is not enough if you just forgive them. That’s good. 
But you have to pray for them too. We refuse to fight with the one who 
slaps us on the cheek. If they take away our coat, we say that they can 
have our shirt too. This is a completely different way of life from the way 
of  this  world  where  everybody  is  seeking  to  push  others  down  and  get  
up higher. If you want to build the body of Christ, you must teach these 
words to the people in your church.
Jesus went on to say that if we did good only to those who did good to 
us, we won’t get any marks for that (verse 33). If we give gifts to someone 
who  gave  us  gifts,  we  get  0%  from  God  for  that.  But  if  we  do  good  to  
someone who did harm to us, then we get 100% from God.
In 6:31, Jesus said that we must treat others in the same way as we want 
to be treated ourselves. Do you want others to speak evil about you behind 
your back? No. Then don’t speak evil about others behind their back. Do 
you want people to forgive you when you have made a blunder? Yes. Then 
forgive others when they commit blunders. It is as simple as that.
In 6:36, Jesus said that in one area we must be as perfect as our heav-
enly Father is – in the area of mercy, Compare this with Matthew 5:48: 
“Be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect”. We cannot be as holy, 
as loving, as wise or as powerful as God. But we can all be as perfect 
as He is, in forgiving others. That means that if we have ten enemies, 
we forgive all ten. “Be merciful as your Heavenly Father is merciful.”

594 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
Don’t  judge  others  (6:38).  Leave  it  to  God  to  judge  them.  He  doesn’t  
need your help to do that.
Don’t be tightfisted but give generously to the needy (6:38) – and God 
will give generously to you. A rich businessman who reportedly used to 
give 90% of his income to the Lord, once said, “I shovel out the money, 
and God shovels it back to me – but God has a bigger shovel!” 
In 6:40, Jesus assured us that if we allow Him (our Teacher) to train 
us fully, one day we will be like Him. Praise God for such a wonderful 
promise. Let us then allow Him to train us through the difficulties and 
trials He takes us through.
Women Who were Blessed
In 7:13, we see again how Jesus was moved with compassion whenever 
he saw human suffering. When the Lord saw this widow in Nain having 
just lost her only son, He was moved with compassion for her. We read 
in the gospels that it was compassion that moved Jesus to heal the sick, 
feed the multitudes and even teach the Scriptures. Every ministry in the 
church must flow out of the compassion of Jesus filling our hearts. Think 
much about the people around you who are suffering, deceived, and led 
astray by the devil. Allow God to move your heart with compassion for 
them and then, from that compassion, go out and serve, preach, teach 
and pray for them.
In 7:36,  we  read  of  a  Pharisee  who  invited  Jesus  for  a  meal.  Jesus  
wasn’t so proud that He wouldn’t go to the house of Pharisees. He’d go 
anywhere where He could bless people. He didn’t go only to the houses of 
sinners. He went to the houses of Pharisees as well. A converted prosti-
tute came there and anointed His feet with an expensive vial of perfume 
as an expression of her gratitude for her sins being forgiven and for being 
saved.  She  had  no  doubt  bought  that  perfume  from  her  earnings  as  a  
prostitute. There was an express command in Deuteronomy 23:18 that 
the  wages  of  a  prostitute  must  never  be  offered  to  God.  Didn’t  Jesus  
know that Scripture? He certainly did. But He was not a legalist like his 
host. His host, Simon the Pharisee thought, “If this Man were a prophet 
He  would  know  who  is  touching  Him.”  Jesus  then  told  the  parable  of  
a man who had forgiven two people – one of 500 denarii and the other 
50 denarii. Both could not repay and he forgave them both. Who would 
love him more? Simon said, “Naturally, the one who was forgiven more.” 
Jesus  then  pointed  out  that  it  was  because  Simon  thought  he  did  not  
have many sins to be forgiven that he did not love the Lord as much as 
this converted prostitute who knew that she was a great sinner who had 
been  forgiven  much.  Our  love  for  the  Lord  depends  on  how  much  we  
realise we have been forgiven.
Many Christians have a false humility that makes them say, “I am the 
greatest  of  sinners.”  If  you  really  believe  that  about  yourself,  then  you

Luke
should  be  loving  the  Lord  more  than  anyone  else.  He  who  is  forgiven  
much should love much. But many who claim to be the chief of sinners 
are often in the pursuit of more money and not living for the Lord. They 
are then just using pious language to get a reputation for humility! Don’t 
ever say you are “the chief of sinners” unless, like Paul, you are willing to 
forsake everything for Christ’s sake. If you have been forgiven much, you 
will love much. If you have given up only little for the Lord, it proves that 
you believe that you have been forgiven only very little.
In 8:1–3, we read that it was certain rich women who were the chief 
financial supporters of Jesus’ team and of His ministry. Jesus was not 
against rich people. He was only against the proud. But rich or poor, if 
they were humble, they could be His disciples and support Him finan-
cially.  Up  to  the  age  of  30,  Jesus  was  a  carpenter  supporting  Himself.  
Thereafter as a full-time worker, He was supported by the voluntary gifts 
of some of His disciples. He never made known His needs to anyone and 
He never asked anybody for anything. And He never promised His disci-
ples  a  salary.  His  Father  provided  all  their  needs  by  moving  people  to  
give. Here we see that rich people can also have a ministry – of support-
ing God’s work financially.
The Lord talked about being a light in 8:16–18. When you put a lamp 
in your room you don’t cover it with a bucket or put it under a bed. You 
always place it where all can see it. This is how we are to let our light 
shine for the Lord too. I have seen in banks and government offices in 
India, how non-Christians hang pictures of their gods near their tables. 
But I have almost never seen a Christian officer hanging up a Bible verse. 
Most Christians are ashamed. Some are afraid that their promotion pros-
pects will suffer thereby – and so they hide their light. What a tragedy! 
Jesus was not ashamed to hang openly on a cross for us. Let us never be 
ashamed to confess Him boldly. When I was working in the Navy, I could 
not  witness  openly.  But  I  would  keep  a  Bible  on  my  table  and  some  
tracts. Those who wanted a tract could take one. There are many ways 
of letting our light shine. It is more important to confess Christ outside a 
church building than inside it. Our light must shine brightly where there 
are no other lights.
In 8:43,  44,  we  read  of  a  woman  who  touched  the  hem  of  Jesus’  
garment.  Many  were  crowding  around  Jesus  at  that  time  but  only  she  
got healed. In church meetings too, many crowd around Jesus. But only 
those who have faith – one here and one there – touch the Lord. At every 
meeting, we should seek to be like that woman, reaching out and touch-
ing the Lord in faith.
Enlarged Hearts to Bless Others
In 9:16, we read about the feeding of the 5000. God wants to use each of 
us to be a blessing to others in this way. The first step is to surrender all

that we have to the Lord. That little boy had 5 loaves and 2 fish and he 
gave all to the Lord. He didn’t keep anything back for himself. Jesus then 
blessed the loaves and fish. That is the second step – God has to put His 
blessing on what we give to Him. He has to pour out His Spirit on us. But 
the multitude is still not fed. The third step is to allow the Lord to break 
us. Jesus broke those loaves. And he breaks us too - through people and 
through situations. Then He fed the multitude. I have seen many Spirit-
filled believers who do not fulfil God’s purpose for their lives – because 
they  have  not  allowed  the  Lord  to  take  them  through  this  last  step  of  
being  broken.  They  have  surrendered  everything  to  the  Lord  and  been  
anointed by the Spirit. But they are self-confident and unbroken. They 
may have large numbers in their ministry. But the quality of their work is 
poor. Even the cults have large numbers. So don’t glory in large numbers 
being added to your church. What is the quality of those people? Are they 
disciples or just converts?
Here is a parable: A doe-rabbit once boasted to a lioness that she had 
20 little ones born that year and asked the lioness how many she had 
given birth to. The lioness replied, “I had only one, but it was a lion.” It is 
better to get one disciple, than twenty converts.
9:23 is one of the most important verses in Luke’s gospel: “If anyone 
wishes  to  come  after  Me  let  him  deny  himself,  take  up  his  cross  every  
day  and  follow  Me.” You  cannot  follow  Jesus  unless  you  are  willing  to  
deny yourself and die to Self daily. To deny Self means to say, “No,” to 
everything  that  your  Self-life  wants.  What  does  “taking  up  the  cross”  
mean? We could put it like this: The cross comes in at the place where 
your  will  crosses  God’s  will.  Your  will  is  like  the  horizontal  arm  of  the  
cross and God’s will is like the vertical arm. To take up the cross means 
dying to your will and doing God’s will. It means giving up your choices, 
your ambitions, your reputation, your preferences and the way you would 
like to react to people, etc. It means to reckon yourself dead with Christ 
every day.
In 9:49, 50, Jesus teaches us what to do when we find someone having 
a ministry that is totally different from ours. Someone was casting out 
demons, but he didn’t join the disciples. John asked Jesus to stop him. 
But Jesus told John to leave him alone and to let him continue that minis-
try. You stick to your calling and let them fulfil theirs. Many Christians 
are so taken up with the importance of their own ministry that they feel 
that everyone should be doing that. “But if the whole body were an eye, 
where would the hearing be; and if the whole were hearing, where would 
the sense of smell be?” (1 Corinthians 12:17). A mature Christian realises 
that God gives different ministries to different people. If one wants to do 
evangelism, and another wants to do social work, let each fulfil his own 
ministry. Something of Christ can be manifested through both. But let 
us  not  criticise  one  another.  There  is  variety  in  creation.  God  did  not  
make every flower the same colour, the same shape or the same size. 

Enlarged Hearts to Bless Others                                                                                                             597
Luke
The rainbow has so many different colours. So also is the body of Christ. 
Some people feel that nobody should go to a Bible-college because they 
themselves  did  not.  Others  feel  that  everybody  should  go  to  a  Bible-
college, because they went themselves. Both are wrong. God can use both 
methods,  according  to  the  calling  of  each  one.  Narrow  minded  people  
however never see anything other than their own ministry. Here is a word 
for such people: “Thank God for every ministry, and stick to your own.”
In 9:52, we see Jesus coming towards Samaria. This was the city where 
a year earlier there had been a great revival. Through one sinful woman 
who was converted, the whole city had been drawn to Jesus (John 4). So 
Jesus sent messengers ahead of Him to make arrangements there. But 
this time, they did not receive Him (verse 53). Perhaps many who were 
converted in Samaria, had decided to get rid of their prejudices against 
the Jews and leave their dead religious systems and follow the Lord. This 
must  have  disturbed  their  religious  leaders;  so  they  decided  not  to  let  
Jesus into the city again. So James and John wanted to call down fire 
on the Samaritans. Jesus rebuked them saying that He had not come to 
destroy men’s lives but to save them (verse 55). If some church kicks you 
out,  just  humble  yourself  and  go  somewhere  else.  That  is  what  I  have  
done more than once.
In  both  the  above  examples,  Jesus  was  trying  to  enlarge  the  hearts  
of His disciples. In many Christian groups, I have seen that the leader 
often  has  a  large  heart,  but  his  followers  are  narrow-hearted,  because  
they don’t know God like their leader. John Wesley and George Whitefield 
were  two  great  preachers  in  England  in  the  18
th
  century.  John  Wesley  
and his followers believed and preached that one could be lost after being 
saved. George Whitfield and his followers preached that once a man was 
saved, he was saved forever. But Wesley and Whitfield were good friends 
and when Whitfield died, it was Wesley who conducted his funeral. One 
of Wesley’s followers then asked him, “Will you see George Whitfield in 
heaven?”  John  Wesley  replied,  “I  don’t  think  so,  because  he  will  be  so  
near the throne and I will be so far back that I may not be able to see him 
there.” Wesley’s followers were narrow-hearted. But Wesley himself was a 
humble, large-hearted man who esteemed Whitefield above himself.
In 10:5, Jesus told His disciples, “Whenever you enter a house, first of 
all say, ‘Peace be to this house’. If a man of peace is there, your peace will 
rest upon him. If not, it will return to you.” Our homes must be islands of 
peace in the restless sea of this world. The man, as the head, must espe-
cially be a man of peace – even if the woman is not a woman of peace. The 
man must be one who will never quarrel, fight, argue, lose his temper, or 
get into controversies. Every Christian home must have a man like that 
to lead it.
In 10:19, we read that Jesus gave His disciples authority over all the 
power of Satan, and promised them that nothing would hurt them. There 
is a difference between authority and power. A truck may have a lot of 

598 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
power but when a small policeman lifts up his hand and tells it to stop, 
it stops – because the policeman has authority. This is a picture of the 
authority we have over ALL the power of Satan. The Bible says, “Submit 
yourself to God and resist the devil – and he will flee from you”  (James 
4:7, 8). Satan will flee from us at the speed of lightning – 300,000 kilo-
metres per second – for that is the speed at which Jesus saw Satan fall 
(10:18)! But we do not rejoice over the fact that Satan is subject to us, 
but that we are God’s children. We rejoice not in what we have done 
for God but in what God has done for us – He has written our names 
in the Book of Life.
Parables With a Message
In 10:30–37, we read the parable of the good Samaritan. The Levite and 
the priest belonged to a respected denomination that had its doctrines 
right. But they did nothing for the needy man here. We can sin even by 
doing nothing! The Samaritan, however, belonged to a despised denomi-
nation (whose doctrines were wrong in many areas). But it was he who 
helped the needy man. Jesus was teaching that often it is those whose 
doctrines are not correct, who do more for the poor and needy than the 
evangelicals. The Levite and the priest were more interested in going for 
their meeting in Jerusalem than in helping a needy man along the way. 
The  good  Samaritan  missed  the  meeting,  but  he  helped  this  man.  We  
may discover at the judgement-seat of Christ that many whose doctrines 
were wrong in some minor areas get a greater reward than those of us 
who  have  all  our  doctrines  right.  So  let  us  not  despise  those  in  other  
denominations who may be doing things differently from us. God values 
those who serve the poor with compassion in Christ’s Name. He will say 
to them, “I was hungry and you fed Me, I was sick and you came to visit 
Me, I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink. When My people 
(whose doctrines were right) were attending meetings, you (who had some 
wrong doctrines) came and helped Me.”
Some  who  hear  this  parable,  can  now  imagine  that  the  most  impor-
tant thing in life is to serve the Lord by helping the poor. And so the Holy 
Spirit gives us a balance here by describing another incident immediately 
thereafter. In 10:38–42, Jesus tells us what the most important thing in 
life really is – it is not to serve the poor but to listen to Him and do what 
He  tells  us  to  do! Here  we  see  Martha  feverishly  serving  the  Lord,  and  
Mary attentively listening to Him. Mary’s activity looked like laziness and 
inactivity, but Jesus rebuked Martha for serving Him and told her that 
what Mary was doing was “the one thing needful” (verse 42). We are not 
called to spend our life “doing something or the other for God”, but to “do 
the will of God”. “The most important thing about a servant is that He does 
just what His Master tells him to do” (1 Corinthians 4:2 - Living).

Parables With a Message                                                                                                                        599
Luke
In 11:1–13, we read that Jesus was praying in a certain place and His 
disciples  heard  Him.  And  they  were  amazed,  because  they  had  never  
heard  anyone  pray  like  that.  They  heard  Jesus  talking  intimately  to  a  
loving Father and not giving an impressive lecture to God (as they had 
heard  the  Pharisees  praying  in  the  synagogues).  So  they  asked  Him  to  
teach  them  also  to  pray  like  He  did.  So  Jesus  taught  them  to  talk  to  
God as their Father. This was revolutionary, because no-one in Israel’s 
history  had  ever  addressed  God  as  “Dad”  (which  is  the  real  meaning  
of  the  Hebrew  word  “Abba”).  We  are  not  to  pray  to  God  or  sing  to  Him  
addressing Him as Jehovah today, but as “Father”. Then Jesus told them 
a parable to complete answering their question on prayer. A man had a 
visitor come to his house at midnight and he had no food to set before 
him. So he went to his neighbour’s house and kept banging away at his 
door until he got some food from him. That, Jesus said, was how they 
were to seek for the power of the Holy Spirit (11:13). The point here is 
that you must, first of all, have a compassion and a burden for the needy 
people you encounter. Then you must recognise that God alone can give 
you what is required to meet their need. So you must seek God for His 
Spirit’s power. If your calling is to preach the word, then ask God first 
of all to give you a love and compassion for those you have to preach to. 
Then keep asking Him for the anointing and revelation of the Spirit for a 
specific word to meet their particular need. We can ask God in the same 
way, if we have to pray for someone’s healing or we have to cast out a 
demon from someone. We are not called to serve everyone in the world, 
but only those whom God sends to us. This man did not want bread for 
all the hungry people in the countryside, but only for the one person who 
came to him. That needy person could be your son or daughter. Jesus 
said that everyone who asks and knocks (like this man did) will get what 
he asks for (verses 9, 10). But those who knock only two or three times 
and give up will receive nothing. God is a better Father than any earthly 
father.  So  He  will  not  deny  us  anything  that  is  good  for  us  (verse  11). 
So let us “pursue after love – and earnestly desire the gifts of the Spirit” 
(1 Corinthians 14:1).
In 12:1,  Jesus  told  His  disciples  to  “beware  of  the  leaven  of  the  
Pharisees  which  is  hypocrisy.”  The  word  ‘hypocrisy’  is  not  an  English  
word but a Greek word – “hupokrisis”. If the translators had translated it 
(like they did the rest of the New Testament) and not transliterated it, the 
translation would have been “acting” or “playacting”. In ancient Greece, a 
“hypocrite” was an actor. So what Jesus was warning against was acting 
like holy people. A Hollywood actor may act as John the Baptist (a holy 
man) in a movie. But after the film-shooting is over, he goes back to his 
normal  life  of  drinking  and  adultery  and  divorce.  That  is  his  real  life.  
Then the next week when the film-shooting begins again, be becomes 
“a holy man” once again.

Luke
Many Christians are exactly like that. When they come to the Sunday 
services,  they  are  “holy”  people,  talking  spiritual  things  and  praising  
God  in  “other  tongues”.  But  when  they  go  home  they  are  back  to  their  
“ mother-tongue”, getting angry with their wives and telling lies. They are 
also back to the pursuit of money the whole week. Then, when Sunday 
comes  along,  they  return  to  their  “acting”  as  holy  men.  The  Hollywood  
actors are actually more honest, in that they don’t pretend that their act 
is  real  or  that  they  are  really  holy  men  all  the  time.  These  Christians,  
however, pretend that they are really holy always! This is what Jesus was 
warning His disciples against. We are to be the same on Sunday as on 
any other day of the week. That is why we must hate hypocrisy.
In 12:3–12, Jesus tells us not to be afraid of persecution, because the 
very hairs on your head are numbered by our Father. He knows the state 
of  every  sparrow  in  the  world,  and  we  are  of  more  value  to  Him  than  
many sparrows. God may allow people to take us to court or even to kill 
us.  But  we  are  never  to  be  afraid  of  men.  We  don’t  even  have  to  think  
what we will reply when questioned. The Holy Spirit will teach us in that 
moment, exactly what to say (verse 12). That is not a promise that we can 
claim when we are preaching, but when we are standing in a court being 
persecuted for our faith. Don’t try to claim this promise when preaching, 
because  it  won’t  work.  You  have  to  prepare  in  advance  for  preaching  
sermons. Preaching is like serving a meal for honoured guests. An Indian 
housewife spends many hours in her kitchen to prepare just one meal. 
We must also take pains to prepare a message for God’s people.
In 12:13,  we  read  of  a  man  who  came  to  the  Lord  and  said,  “Lord, 
tell  my  brother  to  divide  the  family  property  with  me.”  Even  though  his  
request  may  have  been  a  genuine,  righteous  request,  Jesus  refused  to  
get involved in such a dispute. Jesus came here only to help those who 
wanted to get property in heaven – not earth!
“Seek God’s kingdom first and these other things will be added to you” 
(12:31). Every Christian must live his life on earth in such a way that he 
is a living proof of the truth that those who seek God’s kingdom first will 
find all their earthly necessities added to them.
In 12:35 we are urged to be in readiness for the coming of the Lord. 
If the Lord has given you charge over other believers, be faithful not to 
beat them but to give them their food in due season (12:45). There are 
some preachers who instead of feeding the sheep, flog them. When they 
preach, they don’t give the people food to grow spiritually. They hit them 
with one Bible-verse after another. The Lord says that He will come one 
day and punish all those who flogged His children.
In 13:34,  we  see  the  tremendous  compassion  that  Jesus  had  for  
Jerusalem that He wept over the city.
In 14:13, 14, we find one of the commands of the Lord that very few 
believers obey. He said that when you give a luncheon or a dinner, you 
should invite those who cannot repay you. A true disciple of Jesus will 

Disciples and Backsliders                                                                                                                         601
Luke
care much for the poor in the church. If you are a preacher, don’t go to 
the rich primarily (for many go to them), but go to the poor who cannot 
reward  you.  And  the  Lord  Himself  will  reward  you  one  day.  Spread  a  
banquet of God’s Word for those who cannot give you any offerings.
Disciples and Backsliders
In 14:25–34,  the  Lord  laid  down  the  three  essential  conditions  of  
discipleship.
1. You must love Jesus more than anyone else (verse 26).
2. You must take up your cross every day and follow Jesus (verse 27).
3. You must not possess anything on earth (verse 33).
You  can  have  many  things,  but  you  must  not  possess  any  of  them.  
What is the difference between having and possessing? You may have a 
house; but you must treat it as a house that belongs to God, in which He 
has allowed you to live freely. And so with all your property. You must 
recognise that everything you have belongs to God. Only disciples are the 
salt which has not lost its taste (verse 34). Today, we have a lot of salt 
that has no taste, because evangelists have preached forgiveness of sins 
without making people disciples.
In  the  three  parables  in  Chapter  15,  we  see  pictures  of  four  types  of  
backsliders – a lost sheep, a lost younger son, a lost elder son and a lost 
coin – and also of the Triune God. The lost sheep is a picture of a believer 
who went astray accidentally or through carelessness. The shepherd is a 
picture of Jesus, the Son of God. The prodigal son is a picture of a believer 
who  went  away  in  rebellion  against  God  and  the  church.  The  father  is  
a picture of God the Father. He does not go seeking for such a one as in 
the first case. He waits until the son reaches the level of the pigs and 
comes back on his own. The older son is a picture of those who are lost 
in legalism and self-righteousness and pride. The woman who seeks for 
the lost coin is a picture of a church filled with the Holy Spirit. She lit a 
lamp and swept the house (15:8) and searched carefully until she found 
it. When she lost the coin, she was a careless church which was what 
caused some to backslide (the coin being lost). Then she lit a lamp (she 
was filled with the Holy Spirit) and began to seek and she found the lost 
backslidden ones and brought them into the fold. There are many believ-
ers who have no burden at all for the lost and for backsliders. They are 
only interested in themselves. Such believers are completely out of touch 
with God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. A   prayer that 
I have prayed for many years is this (and I have encouraged all the elders 
in  our  churches  to  pray  this  too),  “Lord,  if  there  is  anyone  in  this  area  
seeking for a godly life, please bring him in touch with us, or bring us in 
touch with him. And if You don’t do either of these, tell us what is wrong 

602 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
with us, so that we can set it right, so that we can be in tune with You and 
find the lost.” I would encourage you to pray that prayer. 
The type of fold we bring a lost sheep into is also very important. If the 
fold contains 99 sheep who are full of sicknesses and who are biting and 
tearing each other apart, then that lost sheep is better off in the wilder-
ness than inside such a fold. So we need not only a ministry that goes 
after the lost sheep, but also a ministry that keeps the 99 sheep healthy 
and  peaceful.  Jesus  said:  “There  is  more  joy  in  heaven  over  one  sinner  
that repents (that’s the lost sheep) than the 99 righteous persons who need 
no repentance” (verse 7). What a wonderful church (fold) this is, which 
has  99  righteous  people  who  don’t  need  to  repent  of  anything!  How  is  
that? It is because they are judging themselves and repenting every day. 
This has been my own habit for many years. As a result, I have discov-
ered some un-Christlikeness in my life almost every day in the past few 
years – and repented of it and cleansed myself from it. If you are like that, 
you won’t have time to find fault with other people – because you will be 
so busy cleaning yourself. Then you can build a church of people “who 
need no repentance” where the lost sheep can come and be healed. And 
so  in  our  churches  we  must  preach  repentance  constantly.  Gradually,  
over a period of time, we will have a church, where people have learned 
to judge themselves, and not judge other people.
When the shepherd lost a sheep, the loss was the shepherd’s. When 
the woman lost the coin, the loss was the woman’s. And in the case of 
the lost son, the loss was the Father’s. In all these parables, Jesus was 
teaching  that  it  was  God  who  lost  something  when  man  sinned.  Our  
work in the church is to bring back to God what He has lost.
One thing that the lost son knew was that his father loved him. That 
was why he decided to come home. How did the father know that his son 
was returning that day? Because he was looking out of the window every 
day to see if his son was returning. And one day, he saw him – and he 
ran to welcome him. The older son, however, did not share the passion of 
his father’s heart. He worked hard for his father and always obeyed him 
(verses 28, 29). But he had no passion for the lost. He had no fellowship 
with the heart of his father. Never once did he tell his father, “Let me go 
and look for my younger brother and find him”.
There  are  two  types  of  Christian  workers  and  elders.  One  is  like  the  
father in this story, full of love and compassion. The other is like the elder 
brother,  hard  and  rigid  and  professional.  Each  of  us  can  make  a  choice  
which of the two we are going to be like. In that story, at the beginning, the 
elder son is inside the house and the younger son outside. But when the 
story ends, the younger son is inside and the elder son outside. Many who 
are first now will be last in God’s kingdom. Many Christians will be outside 
the kingdom, because they had no fellowship with the heart of the Father. 
Every brother and sister in the church must be a servant of the Lord and 
must share fellowship with the Father’s heart for those who are lost.

Teaching on Money                                                                                                                                  603
Luke
I had a great longing when I was young to be an evangelist and to spend 
my life in North India. I told the Lord that I was ready to go anywhere He 
sent me – and I still am. But He never told me to go to North India – and 
I wouldn’t ever go where the Lord did not send me. God then gave me the 
gift of teaching and not of evangelism. But I still have a very keen interest 
in the work of the Lord in North India. So I read missionary magazines to 
know what is happening in North India. Even if you are not a missionary, 
I hope you have some desire to know what others are doing for the Lord 
in the difficult places of the world.
Teaching on Money
Chapters 16 to 21 deal with the subject of money. Jesus spoke a lot about 
money. In the gospels, you will find that 16% of His teaching refers to 
money – one in every six verses. That’s the amount of importance that 
Jesus gave to the subject. Whereas Jesus spoke about being free from 
the  love  of  money,  most  preachers  only  urge  people  to  pay  their  tithes  
–  which  Jesus  never  taught  His  disciples  to  practise  (He  only  told  the  
Pharisees who were under the old covenant to do that – Matthew 23:23).
The first parable Jesus spoke here was about an unrighteous steward. 
The essence of that story is that he planned for his future. He knew he 
was  losing  his  job,  and  so  he  did  some  cheating,  so  that  when  he  lost  
his  job,  he  would  have  friends  who  would  give  him  another  job.  Then  
Jesus said, “Make friends for eternity through money.” For that steward, 
his  future  was  only  on  this  earth.  For  us,  our  future  is  in  eternity.  He  
prepared for his future using the power over money that he had. We must 
also make friends for eternity by using our money to spread the gospel 
and  win  souls.  Then  one  day  people  will  meet  you  in  heaven  and  say,  
“Because you gave your money for the spread of the gospel, I was saved 
and I am here” (16:9).
And then Jesus said these very strong words, “If you are not faithful 
with earthly wealth, who will give you the true riches?” (16:11). The true 
riches are the Divine nature, the anointing of the Holy Spirit and reve-
lation on the word of God. Why is it most believers never become more 
Christlike in their speech or get any fresh revelation from the Spirit on 
the word of God? Because they are not faithful with money. 
Jesus then said that no servant could serve two masters. You cannot 
serve  both  God  and  money  (16:13).  You  have  to  make  a  choice.  The  
Pharisees  had  missionary  programmes  but  they  were  also  great  lovers  
of money (16:14). Jesus said to them, “You justify yourself in the sight of 
men (You try to appear very spiritual before men). But God knows your 
hearts. That which men value highly is an abomination in the sight of God” 
(16:15). I have kept this verse before me always and sought to remember 
it all my life. Make a list of all the things that man esteems greatly and 
recognise  that  God  considers  all  of  them  as  detestable.  Never  glory  in  

604 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
anything that man values highly. You may have some such things; but 
place the value on them that God places on them – zero. Don’t meditate 
on them or gloat over them. Are you good-looking or intelligent or rich 
or highly qualified? There is nothing wrong with any of these. But don’t 
imagine that God places any values on these – because many of the most 
godly  people  in  the  world  were  not  good-looking,  not  highly  intelligent,  
not wealthy and not academically qualified. What God values is humility 
and reverence for Him, which the world does not value. If you value the 
things that God values, your service for Him will be far more effective.
Then  Jesus  told  the  true  story  of  a  certain  rich  man  and  a  beggar  
named Lazarus (16:19). This is not a parable for Jesus never used any 
names (like Lazarus and Abraham) in any parable. This is the true story 
of a man who was entrusted with a lot of money by God, but who used it 
all selfishly for himself and did not use any of it to bless his needy broth-
ers with. He did not care for the poor beggar, Lazarus who sat at his gate. 
Lazarus was his own brother – for they were both children of Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob. But that rich man did not care for Lazarus. That proves 
that  he  did  not  have  any  living  faith  in  God.  James  says,  “What  use  
is  it,  my  brethren,  if  someone  says  he  has  faith  but  has  no  works?  Can  
that faith save him? If a brother is without clothing and in need of daily 
food, and you say to him, ‘Go in peace, be warmed and be filled’, but you 
do  not  give  him  what  is  necessary  for  his  body,  what  use  is  that?  Even  
so  faith,  if  it  has  no  works,  is  dead,  being  by  itself.”  (James  2:14–17). 
Salvation is by faith – and that rich man went to hell because he had no 
living faith. When Lazarus died, nothing is said about him being buried 
(16:22). Perhaps his body was thrown into the garbage dump. But what 
did that matter to Lazarus, when he himself was in paradise. The rich 
man, however, got a grand burial. The chief-priest (equivalent of an arch-
bishop) must have been there (because religious leaders usually attend 
the funerals of the rich), and he must have said many good things about 
this rich man. But the man was in hell while his funeral was going on! 
[Some people remain in a dead denomination only because they want a 
decent burial – or a grand wedding in a cathedral!] The rich man could 
see that Lazarus whom he despised was in heaven. With all his money 
and his religion, the rich man himself couldn’t get there. “God has chosen 
the poor of the world rich in faith” (James 2:5). If God has given you money, 
He expects you to use it to bless others. There was one more reason why 
the rich man went to hell. He discovered it when he reached hell – he had 
not repented (16:30). And he discovered that if Lazarus was in paradise, 
it was because Lazarus had repented and believed.
In 17:3, 4 Jesus spoke about the importance of forgiving others, even 
if they sin against us seven times in a single day.
In 17:10,  He  said  that  even  after  we  obey  every  single  command  of  
the  Lord,  we  can  still  consider  ourselves  only  as  “unworthy  servants”, 
because we only did what we should have done. In a world, where even 

Christ’s Second Coming                                                                                                                           605
Luke
Christians are hankering after theological degrees, here is a good degree 
to get: “U.S. – Unworthy Servant”! How many are interested in placing that 
degree after their names? But when can we get even this lowly degree? 
Only when we have obeyed every single command of the Lord! Some of us 
imagine that we are very useful servants of the Lord. We haven’t taken 
our Lord’s words seriously enough. Just because the Lord blessed us a 
little bit here or there, we begin to think that we are very important and 
useful to God! How easy it is to deceive ourselves. At our very best, we 
will still be only useless servants. We are what we are only by the grace of 
God (1 Corinthians 15:10). Have a sober estimate of yourself at all times 
– and you will keep on receiving grace from God for greater and greater 
things in your life.
In 17:12–19, we read of 10 lepers who with a loud voice asked the Lord 
to heal them. They were all healed. But only one of them came back to 
the Lord and with a loud voice gave thanks. And because he gave thanks, 
he got something more. “Your faith has saved you” (verse 19). The other 
nine got only physical healing. This man was a despised Samaritan, but 
he got what the other nine respectable Jews did not get – salvation. You 
get more from the Lord when you thank Him for His blessings.
Christ’s Second Coming
Then  Jesus  spoke  about  His  second  coming.  What  we  read  in  
Matthew 24 is repeated by the Holy Spirit here, because He does not 
want anyone to be deceived. Don’t believe those who say, ‘Look, He has 
come here or there (secretly).’ His coming will be seen by everyone, just 
as the lightning that flashes from one part of the sky to another. Jesus 
made it clear again and again that He will not come secretly. There 
will be only one second-coming. All believers will be on earth during 
the great tribulation that precedes His return – because the Lord will 
not take away His best soldiers from earth at a time when He needs 
their  witness  the  most  –  during  the  reign  of  the  Antichrist.  We  shall  
no doubt suffer. Many will no doubt fall from the faith. But some will 
stand true to the Lord and glorify His Name. So when people preach, 
“He  will  come  secretly  here  or  there”  (verse  23),  the  Lord  told  us  not  
to believe them. So I don’t believe them. None of the apostles taught 
or believed this strange doctrine. And nobody preached it for over 18 
centuries since the day of Pentecost. The doctrine of a secret rapture 
arose for the first time in England in the mid-1800s – and its echoes 
are now heard all over the world. I am not surprised that this doctrine 
was invented by comfort-loving Christians in a country (England) that 
had not faced persecution for centuries.
And when the Lord does finally come, a few will be raptured to meet 
Him  in  the  air  and  to  welcome  Him  to  earth.  Many  will  be  left  behind.  

606 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
Two will be in a bed (husband and wife obviously); one will be taken and 
the other will be left behind (17:34). Two will be working together in the 
same place; one will be taken, the other will be left behind (verse 35). So 
the Lord told us to be perpetually ready. For example, if you are on the 
roof of your house, you should not have to go down to your house. If you 
are out in the fields, you should not have to go back. Those days people 
worked in fields. Today, we work in offices. Let me explain what the Lord 
was implying: If you are in your office when the Lord comes, you should 
not have to say, “Lord, please wait. I quarrelled with my wife this morning 
and I have to go home and ask for her forgiveness.” Perpetual readiness 
means  that  you  have  settled  all  matters  at  all  times.  If  you  are  on  the  
housetop you must be ready to be raptured from there. You should not 
have any attachment to any material things inside your house. The way 
to be ready for the coming of the Lord is by keeping an absolutely clear 
conscience and being thoroughly detached from everything of earth – at 
all times. 
In 18:1–7, Jesus again spoke about persistence in prayer. The only two 
parables  that  Jesus  ever  spoke  about  prayer  emphasised  persistence.  
In Chapter 11, the need was for power to serve others. Here the need is 
personal deliverance from the oppression of Satan. The widow is a picture 
of a believer. The Lord always pictured believers as weak and helpless – 
a widow or a sheep. This was so that we would seek for help from God 
and  not  depend  on  our  own  abilities.  When  we  are  fearful  or  defeated  
by sin, we are being harassed by Satan. We must seek God until we are 
freed from this oppression. The widow persisted in asking the judge until 
she got freedom from harassment by the enemy. We must do the same. 
Jesus concluded the parable, however, by stating that when He returns 
to earth, He will find very few who have faith for such a life of perpetual 
victory (18:8). We are living in those days now. Many Christians spend 
their time only in theological argument as to whether victory is possible 
or not. Jesus, however, said that only those who mourn (for their sins) 
will be strengthened. The more we recognise our helplessness, the more 
we will go to God in prayer and weep on our pillows at night for victory. 
And then we will get it!
The next parable that Jesus spoke (18:9–14) was to expose the pride of 
self-righteous people – the parable of the Pharisee and the tax- collector. 
The Pharisee here wasn’t even praying to God. He was praying to himself 
(verse 11). He himself was his god! A proud man worships himself, and 
boasts about his praying, fasting, tithing, missionary work etc. The poor 
tax-collector  prayed  saying,  “Be  merciful  to  me  the  sinner”.  He  called  
himself “the sinner” as if he was the only sinner on earth. Therefore he 
went home justified. The first will be last and the last first.
Then  comes  two  more  incidents  related  to  money.  In  the  first  one, 
a  rich  young  ruler  was  unwilling  to  pay  the  price  to  follow  Jesus  and  
turned away from Him (18:18–27).

Christ’s Second Coming                                                                                                                           607
Luke
The second incident is about Zaccheus, a rich tax-collector who had 
cheated  many  people  in  his  life  (19:1–10).  But  Zaccheus  being  eager  
to  meet  the  Lord  climbed  up  into  a  tree  to  see  Him.  As  Jesus  walked  
along that road, the Holy Spirit prompted Him to stop and look up into 
that  tree.  The  Lord  then  told  Zaccheus  that  He  would  like  to  visit  his  
house. Zaccheus was thrilled. But as the Lord came in front of the house, 
“Zaccheus stopped” (verse 8) and said (as it were), “Lord, You are holy. 
You  can’t  come  to  my  house  because  I  have  built  it  with  unrighteous  
money that I got by cheating many people. But Lord, I’m now going to 
give half my money to the poor and I am going to return four times the 
money I took from all those whom I cheated.” How did Zaccheus change? 
Jesus never preached a sermon on righteousness there. It was the Light 
that went out from Jesus that convicted Zaccheus. 
The  Old  Testament  law  had  stated  that  when  you  make  restitution  
you must add 20% to the amount (Numbers 5:7). But here Zaccheus was 
adding 300%, because he had cheated people many years earlier and he 
wanted to return the money with interest. As soon as Jesus heard that 
He said, “Salvation has come to this house” (19:9). When a man is willing 
to do what Zaccheus did, you can be sure that he is saved.
In 19:11–20, we read yet another parable related to money. A noble-
man who was going on a long journey called his ten slaves and gave them 
each some money and told them to do business with it. One slave was so 
faithful in investing it, that he produced ten minas with that one mina. 
Another man produced five minas, while yet another wrapped up the 
mina in a handkerchief, buried it under the ground, and gave it back to 
the master when he returned. He didn’t commit any sin. He just wasted 
his one life. In the parable in Matthew 25, the amounts given were differ-
ent. That parable was about gifts. One may be an apostle and another 
a  mother.  An  apostle  has  more  opportunity  to  travel  and  serve  than  a  
mother. So God expects more from the apostle. But in the parable here, 
the amount given to each person is the same. This refers to two things. 
First of all, to our time. We all have the same amount of time every day 
– 24 hours. But what we do with our time differs. Some use their time 
profitably to study the Word while others waste it in gossip. Secondly, 
this refers to our body. We all have the same body and are tempted in 
exactly the same way through our lusts. But our reactions to those lusts 
vary. Some fight against it and overcome temptation, while others yield 
to their lusts and sin. So one brother who uses his time and his body for 
the glory of God acquires ten minas, whereas another produces only five. 
In 19:30, we read of Jesus entering Jerusalem on a donkey. Kings rode 
on horses, but Jesus chose a donkey. He did it to show that all that is 
big and great in the eyes of the world is despicable before God. In the Old 
Testament,  God  even  spoke  through  a  donkey  once  –  to  Balaam.  It’s  a  
great encouragement to know that even if we are as stupid as donkeys, 
the Lord needs us and wants to use us for His purposes. That donkey got 

608 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Spirit-Filled Man
Luke
a lot of honour that day – and so may you, when the Lord uses you. But if 
that donkey imagined that people were appreciating it, then it was sadly 
mistaken. They were honouring the Lord. The moment Jesus got off, it 
reverted  to  the  same  old  donkey  it  was  before  –  and  nobody  honoured  
it any more. That’s a good lesson for us to keep in mind. When people 
appreciate us, it is Christ in us that they are appreciating.
In 20:25, the Lord spoke about money again: “Render to Caesar what 
is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s.” Give to everyone what is due unto 
them.
In Chapter  21,  we  read  about  the  second  coming  of  the  Lord.  There  
will be persecution and even our relatives may betray us. But we need 
never fear, because no-one can touch even a hair on our head without 
the Lord’s permission (verse 18).
The Last Supper and the Crucifixion
In 22:24, we see that even after all those years of listening to the Lord, 
the  disciples  were  still  discussing  who  was  the  greatest  among  them.  
The Lord did not select perfect people as His disciples – and He was very 
gentle in correcting them. He knew that when they were filled with the 
Holy Spirit, they would all be changed – and they were. Once they were 
filled, they no longer fought with each other for position or honour.
In 22:31, we read of Jesus warning Simon Peter that Satan had asked 
God for permission to sift him like wheat – and God had given Satan that 
permission. This reminds us of the story of Job, where too, Satan had to 
take God’s permission before he could trouble Job. God will never allow 
Satan to tempt us beyond what we are able to bear (1 Corinthians 10:13). 
Satan  has  to  take  permission  from  God  each  time  he  seeks  to  trouble  
us  or  tempt  us  or  attack  us  or  persecute  us.  This  fact  should  comfort  
us immensely. And Jesus told Peter that when Satan tempted him, he 
would fall – not just once but three times. Yet Jesus never prayed that 
Peter would not fall. He only prayed that Peter’s faith would not fail. Why 
did Jesus not pray that Peter would not fall? Because Peter was so proud 
that nothing less than falling into sin would humble him. It is only when 
we fall – repeatedly – that we recognise that nothing good dwells in our 
flesh and that we can never overcome sin on our own. And when we have 
made a mess of our life and hit rock bottom – when we have come to that 
zero point, to an end of confidence in our own ability – then we must not 
lose  faith.  God  still  loves  us  and  He  will  make  us  overcomers.  Failure  
accomplishes a purpose in God’s plan.
Peter’s failure and his weeping bitterly for his failure was all prepara-
tion for Pentecost. If he had not fallen so deeply into sin that night, he 
would  have  stood  up  on  the  day  of  Pentecost  as  a  proud  man  looking  
down on all the sinners there. But as a broken man, he looked at them as 

The Last Supper and the Crucifixion                                                                                                      609
Luke
sinners just like him. He felt that he was the biggest sinner of all. That’s 
the type of person God picks up, fills with the Holy Spirit, and uses in 
His service. And when God used him mightily that could not go to Peter’s 
head any more, for he knew what a failure he had been. What a wonder-
ful purpose there was in Peter’s failure.
In 23:40–42, there are two lessons that we can learn from the thief on 
the cross, who was saved.
First of all, he recognised that Jesus had done nothing wrong. How did 
he know that? Because he saw the way Jesus conducted Himself when 
He  was  accused.  That  thief  had  seen  so  many  people  who,  when  they  
were being crucified, would curse and swear. But here he saw Someone 
saying, “Father, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.” 
That  opened  his  eyes.  That  was  what  opened  the  eyes  of  the  Roman  
centurion  too  –  who  acknowledged,  “Truly  this  is  the  Son  of  God.”  It  is  
when others see a forgiving nature in us, that they too will be convicted 
of their sin.
The second thing we see is that while the other thief wanted to be taken 
down from the cross (believing that he did not deserve to die), this thief 
admitted that he deserved to be crucified. Adam blamed his wife for 
his  sin  and  was  turned  out  of  paradise.  This  thief  acknowledged  his  
sin and was admitted into paradise immediately (23:43). Paradise has 
been prepared for those who are honest enough to acknowledge that 
they have sinned and deserve hell.
In 24:13–33, we read of two disciples walking to Emmaus and the risen 
Jesus  joining  them.  It  was  a  seven  mile  journey  and  that  would  have  
taken two to three hours of a leisurely walk. And for all that time, they 
had a Bible study from Genesis to Malachi. He showed them “Christ” in 
all those Scriptures (24:27). And their hearts burned within them as He 
spoke (24:32). That’s how it is when Jesus speaks. Those who preach the 
Word must long to preach like this – where people‘s eyes are opened and 
their hearts burn within them as they hear the Word.
Finally,  after  appearing  to  His  eleven  disciples,  He  told  them  to  wait  
in Jerusalem until they were “endued with power from on high” (24:49). 
They  obeyed  Him  and  spent  the  next  ten  days  praising  God  (24:53).  It  
was in that atmosphere of praise that the Holy Spirit fell on all of them in 
the upper room. The Spirit falls on people even today in a similar atmos-
phere! Hallelujah!



JOHN
Jesus Christ – The Eternal God
J
ohn  1:1  goes  back  to  the  real  “beginning”,  before  the  “beginning” 
mentioned  in  Genesis  1:1.  The  “Word”  refers  to  Jesus  Christ  and  
He is called “God” here. John emphasises the Deity of Christ. Jesus 
was  God  from  all  eternity.  One  day,  “the Word became flesh”  (1:14). 
He was God when He walked on this earth in our flesh, and He is God 
today. That is why we worship Him and pray to Him. Jesus Himself said 
that  “only  God  can  be  worshipped”  (Matthew  4:10)  –  and  when  people  
worshipped Him on earth, He accepted their worship.
Why is He called “the Word”? There is nothing philosophical or compli-
cated about its meaning. The Bible is a simple book whose meaning has 
unfortunately  been  complicated  by  scholars.  It  doesn’t  require  a  clever  
mind to understand it but a pure heart like a “babe’s” (Matthew 11:25). 
John,  who  wrote  this  gospel,  was  not  an  educated  philosopher  but  an  
uneducated fisherman. Today people go to Bible seminaries and write 
long theses on what this fisherman wrote and get a doctorate in theology 
– a doctorate which John himself would never have been able to get! 
A spoken or written “word” is an audible (or visible) expression of an 
inaudible  (or  invisible)  thought.  It  is  only  when  we  put  our  thoughts  
into words  that  others  can  understand  us.  If  God  had  remained  in  
heaven or if He had come to earth only as a Spirit, we would never have 
been able to understand Him. But He came in the form of Jesus – and 
so we can understand Him. That is why Jesus is called the Word. He is 
the visible and audible expression of the Invisible God. No-one but He 
can have that title.
“In Him (Jesus) was life, and the life was the light of men” (1:4). Light 
always drives away the darkness. And that is what the life of Jesus does 
everywhere. When the life of Jesus comes into us it will drive away all the 

612 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Eternal God
John
darkness, if we allow it. When you live in a room with all the windows 
and  doors  closed,  even  though  the  sunlight  is  bright  outside,  there  is  
darkness inside. But if you open even a small ventilator, the light comes 
in  immediately.  Even  if  there  is  a  little  crack  in  the  window,  the  light  
will  come  in.  Light  has  a  longing  to  enter  even  through  the  slightest,  
little crack. That’s how the life of Jesus is – eagerly waiting to enter your 
heart and flood it. But He stands at the door and knocks. The measure 
in which you open your heart will be the measure in which He floods it 
with His life.
Jesus told his disciples (and us): “You are the light of the world” (Matthew 
5:14). In the Old Testament, God’s written word was the light. “Thy word 
is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path” (Psalm 119:105), God’s 
Law  was  the  only  light  they  had  in  those  days.  But  today,  God’s  light  
is not primarily the Bible. It is the Word that has become flesh. Jesus 
is the light. He didn’t say, “My teaching is the light.” He said, “I am the 
light.” And He didn’t say, “Your teaching is the light.” He said, “You are 
the light”. So the light is our life, and not the wonderful things we may 
teach. If your life is not a light, then if you speak fantastic truths, you are 
a hypocrite – and that leaven will destroy you. Everything we teach must 
be backed up by our life. The life of Jesus must influence our thoughts, 
our financial dealings, our home-life, the way we talk to our wives, the 
way we bring up our children, the way we deal with other people in our 
offices, and the way we deal with our co-workers and the youngest broth-
ers in our church. The life of Jesus is the light. This is the great lack in 
our country today.
“As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children 
of  God,  even  to  those  who  believe  in  His  name”  (1:11,  12).  We  become  
God’s children when we receive Him as our Lord. There is a difference 
between  children  and  sons.  A  son  is  grown  up  and  mature.  A  child  is  
just a baby. When you receive Jesus as your Saviour you don’t become 
a  mature  son,  you  become  a  baby.  You  have  to  grow  up  to  become  a  
mature son.
Grace and Truth
When Jesus came as the Word to earth, the disciples saw the glory of God 
in Him “full of grace and truth” (1:14). There was a balance in the glory 
that  Christ  revealed  –  there  was  grace  and  there  was  also  truth.  Truth  
speaks  of  reality  as  well  as  the  truth  proclaimed  in  God’s  Word.  Jesus  
said “Thy word is Truth” (John 17:17). We find the word “truth”, “true” and 
“truly” occurring over 70 times in this gospel. It is one of John’s major 
themes.
But  that  truth  (consisting  of  commandments,  laws,  and  principles)  
must be covered over with grace, if it is to be attractive to people. In our 
body we have bones (a picture of truth) and physical flesh (a picture of 

Grace and Truth                                                                                                                                        613
John
grace)  to  cover  the  bones.  If  we  were  only  bones,  how  attractive  would  
we  be?  If  you  saw  a  bony  skeleton  walking  up  to  you  one  night,  you  
would run. That is why people ran away from the Pharisees. They had 
quite a bit of truth but they had no grace. Some Christians are so legal-
istic, emphasising truth and rules and commandments all the time, that 
people are repelled. Jesus had bones too – but the bones were covered 
over with flesh. Truth was covered with grace in Him, and so even the 
worst of sinners were drawn to Him. Many of us have driven away our 
unconverted relatives from the Lord, because of our emphasis on truth. 
They see us as skeletons and run away from the “false Christ” that we 
present.
On  the  other  hand  there  are  people  who  overemphasise  grace.  How  
would we be if we had no bones in our bodies? We wouldn’t be able to 
stand, because we would be like jellyfish that have no bones. There are 
some advantages however in having no bones. We can squeeze through 
any opening – of any shape!! Some Christians are like that. They have no 
convictions on any doctrines. They can compromise and fit in, into any 
group, because they are “evangelifish”! Like chameleons they can change 
their colour to suit their surroundings. 
So we see that both truth and grace are necessary if we are to present 
Christ adequately to the world.
None of us can be perfectly balanced in this area. And that is why God 
has given us the Body of Christ. If we are strong on “truth”, God will 
give us brothers to work with, who are strong on “grace”. They can’t 
manifest the glory of God without us and we can’t manifest the glory 
of  God  without  them.  But  together  we  can  show  forth  Christ  fully.  
Until the end of our lives, we must recognise that we are imbalanced 
– towards one side or the other – and that our salvation can be found 
only  as  we  work  together  with  other  members  of  the  Body  of  Christ.  
Jesus alone was perfectly balanced, because He was the full Body of 
Christ in Himself. We however are only a part of His Body. That is why 
we  must  accept  those  who  have  a  different  emphasis  from  ours,  in  
Christ’s Body.
“The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth were realized 
through  Jesus  Christ”  (1:17).  That  verse  teaches  us  that  there  was  no 
grace in the world until Jesus came. The law came through Moses. That 
was the old covenant. There was no grace under the old covenant. The 
word  “grace”  is  never  found  in  the  Old  Testament.  It  is  found  only  in  
the New Testament. The word “grace” found in the King James Version 
of Genesis  6:8  is  a  mistranslation.  The  NASB  translates  it  correctly  as,  
“favour”  What  is  the  meaning  of  grace?  The  most  commonly  accepted  
definition  of  “grace”  as  ‘the  unmerited  favour  of  God’  is  incorrect.  All 
human beings have got unmerited favour from God – and that is mercy, 

614 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Eternal God
John
not grace. They had mercy under the old covenant. Through God’s mercy 
they  received  the  forgiveness  of  sins  (Psalm  103:3).  But  with  grace,  we  
can get victory over sin. Mercy deals with our past life, the guilt of our 
sin.  Grace  deals  with  our  future,  giving  us  victory  over  sin.  When  the  
Lord says, “My grace is sufficient for you”, it means grace can meet our 
every need in the future. 
As  in  all  the  other  gospels,  John  also  begins  with  the  promise  that  
Jesus will baptise (immerse) people in the Holy Spirit (1:33). There are 
two ways to be immersed – one by being immersed in a river or a tank 
and the other is by standing under a waterfall. Baptism in water is done 
in a tank or a river. To be baptised in the Holy Spirit is to be immersed 
by this waterfall of the river of God which has been flowing from His 
throne to earth ever since the day of Pentecost. The waterfall falls in a 
place called “Humility”. If we remain in humility all the days of our life, 
this river will keep falling on us and immersing us and flowing through 
us to others.
Come, See and Follow
When two disciples of John the Baptist asked Jesus, “Where do You live?” 
He said, “Come and see” (1:39). The old covenant servant of God would 
say, “Come and hear.” But the new covenant servant of God says, “Come 
and see.” In the old covenant, the invitation was, “Moses has come down 
from the mountain with a message from God. Come and hear.” But in the 
new covenant the message is, “Jesus has come from heaven. Come and 
see the way He lives.” Under the old covenant, the emphasis was on the 
message. Under the new covenant, the emphasis is not on the message, 
but the messenger. We are the message. So we say, “Come and see how 
I  live  with  my  wife,  how  I  behave  with  my  co-workers  in  my  church,  
how I  treat the youngest brothers in my church, how I keep my accounts, 
how I bring up my children. Come and see every area of my life. You can 
follow me as I follow Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1).
Nowadays we have so many preachers coming to India from America. 
But if we don’t know how that man lives with his wife in his home, whether 
he is a divorced man, how he has brought up his children, and what type 
of church he has built there, then I, for one, would not ask him to speak 
in  my  church.  I  am  not  going  to  be  impressed  by  powerful  preaching.  
The only man I will respect is the man who can say, “Come and see how I 
live.” If however you can only say, “Come and hear how well I can preach 
(or heal the sick)”, then I am not interested. Such a man is an old cove-
nant servant – and he will build only an old-covenant church. Babylon is 
built by those who can only say “Come and hear.” They may emphasise 
correct doctrine and even fight for it. But they do not show the truth by 
the way they live. If their doctrine is really the truth, it should produce 
truth (reality) in their life as well. If their doctrine doesn’t produce a holy 
life, then their doctrine must be wrong. Jesus had life, and that life was 

Come, See and Follow                                                                                                                              615

the light of men. John’s theme is life, throughout his gospel and in his 
epistles as well. For thousands of years this life was hidden. Man could 
only get words from God. But then the Word became flesh, and now we 
can experience that eternal life. This is the real gospel. That’s why Paul 
said, “Follow me as I follow Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1). Every servant of 
God today should be able to say that too.
Some  preachers  say,  “Don’t  follow  me.  Follow  Christ.”  That  sounds  
very humble, but it is not scriptural. Why does he say that? Because he 
knows that his life is a bad example. In that case, he shouldn’t be preach-
ing at all. He should go home and straighten out his life first. When we 
ask others to follow us as we follow Christ, we are NOT claiming to have 
become like Christ. No. We haven’t reached the top of that mountain yet. 
That will happen only when Christ comes again. But we are not sitting 
at the bottom of the mountain either. We are saying that the gospel has 
begun  to  change  our  way  of  life,  our  thought-patterns,  our  manner  of  
speech,  the  way  we  handle  money,  and  the  way  we  behave  in  general.  
And we are asking others to climb this mountain of total transformation 
into the likeness of Christ, along with us.
I heard of a brother from the West who was visiting India who bought 
a first class train-ticket and got into the train. He saw that someone was 
sitting in his seat, who seemed to be reluctant to get up. Instead of fight-
ing with him, he spread a newspaper on the floor near the toilet and sat 
there. When the ticket-inspector came along, he asked this brother why 
he was sitting on the floor. He replied, “Because someone else is sitting 
on my seat.” The ticket-inspector was amazed that a foreigner would do 
this and asked him why he did that. The brother replied, “Because I am a 
Christian, I don’t fight with people.” The ticket collector got converted! Did 
that  man  get  converted  through  listening  to  a  powerful  sermon?  No.  He 
SAW a powerful sermon in that brother’s conduct. That is what it means 
to be the light of the world. It is when we travel in trains and buses that we 
often see selfish human behaviour at its worst. It’s there that we have to 
manifest the beauty, humility and patience of Christ to an ungodly world.
In 1:47, we see Jesus saying about Nathaniel, “Behold a man in whom 
there is no guile.” What a wonderful testimony to receive from the Lord. 
He did not say that Nathaniel was sinless or perfect – because Nathaniel 
was neither sinless nor perfect, and the Lord does not tell lies. Jesus only 
said  that  the  man  was  honest  and  transparent  like  clear  glass!  Many  
Christians  are  like  frosted  glass  –  they  are  not  transparent.  There  are  
many things they hide on the other side of the opaque glass. On the front 
side they look very holy. But behind the frosted glass they live another 
life. To have no guile is to be like clear glass where we have nothing in our 
inner life or private life that we want to hide. We may still be defeated by 
anger etc., but we are honest about it. We don’t pretend. In Revelation 21, 
we are told that the new Jerusalem (the church of Jesus Christ) is like 
clear glass. That’s how our life must be if we want to be in that church.

John
The First Sign
In Chapter 2, we read about a marriage in Cana that Jesus and His disci-
ples attended. In 2:11, we read that “this beginning of His signs Jesus did 
in Cana in Galilee.” John calls Jesus’ miracles as signs. That means that 
every miracle was a parable too. It had a spiritual message. What is the 
message here? First of all: Your own wine of joy in earthly things will run 
out one day. Jesus can give you heavenly wine – a life of “righteousness, 
peace and joy in the Holy Spirit” (Romans 14:17). When your earthly wine 
runs dry, be honest about it and go and tell the Lord – just like Mary did. 
That’s all that you have to do. You don’t have to go to the vineyard and 
collect grapes, crush them and make wine. No. Just go to Jesus and say, 
“Lord, I have no joy or peace or victory in my life. I am unable to ‘rejoice 
in the Lord always’, as you have told us to.” The Lord will give you His 
new wine – His life.
Jesus could have created wine from nothing in those empty pots. But 
He didn’t do that. He called the servants in the house to work with Him. 
The Lord uses lowly people even today as His co-workers. Have the spirit 
of a servant – and the Lord will do miracles through you. The servants 
here filled the pots with water. Jesus turned it into wine. We have to do 
only the easy part and the Lord does the difficult part. The Lord wants 
you to be a partner with Him in His work. When the servants served out 
the wine, the people were amazed for they had never tasted such good 
wine in their life.
In my own ministry, I have often brought my tasteless water (my own 
thoughts) to the Lord and He has converted it into wine and asked me to 
preach it. And as in Cana, people have wondered where I got such good 
wine from!! It was from the Lord. Through this the beginning of His signs, 
the Lord teaches us how to serve Him. There is no place for laziness here. 
We have to work hard and study the Scriptures first of all. It was hard 
work to fill those pots with 600 litres of water (2:6). God never does His 
work through lazy people.
In 2:14–17, we read of Jesus chasing out from the temple those who 
were bringing the spirit of the market-place into the house of prayer. He 
made a scourge of cords first. Can you see this picture in your mind: 
Jesus sitting in a corner and collecting various bits of string and twisting 
them  into  a  rope.  That  would  have  taken  some  time  and  His  disciples  
must have wondered what He was doing.
In  these  two  incidents  in  Chapter  2,  we  see  grace  and  truth.  Jesus  
served  first-class  wine  at  a  wedding.  And  then  He  made  a  whip  and 
chased out of the temple those who were making money in God’s Name. 
Our ministry must have both the wine and the whip in it – ‘wine’ to the 
needy and a ‘whip’ to Christian racketeers.
When we stand in the pulpit, we have to stand there as a man of God – 
as a representative of God on earth. In my own church, I have told people: 
“The best thing for you to do is to fear God. But if you don’t fear God, 

No Condemnation                                                                                                                                    617
John
then you better fear me, because I am not going to allow any nonsense 
in this church. I am not going to allow you to come here to make profit, 
or to gossip, or to draw people after yourself, or to try and get a name 
for yourself. If you come here and you don’t want to be a servant, if you 
don’t want to humble yourself, if you are unwilling to clean the toilets in 
this building, then there is no place for you here in this church. Here we 
are all equal – no-one is senior or junior. We all sweep the floor and we 
all clean the toilets. We are all brothers. No one is greater than another. 
If you are seeking for honour, then you must go and find some other 
church,  not  this  one.”  That  is  how  we  have  driven  out  the  “sellers  of  
sheep and doves” from our midst. If we are not firm, we will produce only 
wishy-washy  churches,  like  the  many  hundreds  of  churches  that  have  
brought dishonour to God’s Name in India.
In 2:24, 25, we read that “Jesus did not commit Himself to everyone.” 
Many people believed in Him, but He did not believe in everyone – because 
He knew what was in each man’s heart. It is only if we are totally commit-
ted to the Lord that He will be totally committed to us.
In Chapter  3,  we  read  about  Nicodemus  coming  to  Jesus  by  night.  
Jesus Christ was the most important Person that ever walked on the face 
of this earth. Yet Nicodemus could come to His house, even late at night, 
without fixing an appointment. I don’t know whether it was midnight, 
but Jesus took time to talk to him. There were times when Jesus didn’t 
have time even to eat His food (Mark 3:20) or to sleep (Luke 6:12). If you 
serve the Lord, you must be willing to be inconvenienced. If you are more 
interested in food and sleep, it is better to do some other business than 
serving the Lord.
Jesus spoke here about being born of water and the spirit (3:5). Water 
is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Fire is another symbol. In John’s gospel we 
see a description of how we grow in life in the Holy Spirit. When we are 
born again (born of water), we have a cup of water (“the cup of salvation” 
– Psalm 116:13). This cup of water must then become a “well of water” 
(John 4:14), and finally, “rivers of water” (John 7:38).
When we are born of water, the Holy Spirit comes in and produces a new 
life in us. Then the Lord leads us on to have a well of water. If you have 
a well in your house, you won’t be dependent on any outside source 
for your water – our joy and peace and victory will not be dependent 
on circumstances or how people treat us. Then the Lord leads us to a 
third stage, where this water flows out like rivers in many directions to 
bless many people. We should not be satisfied until we have reached 
the third stage.
No Condemnation
In 3:17,  we  read,  “God  did  not  send  His  Son  into  the  world  to  condemn  
the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.” We can learn 

618 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Eternal God
John
three things from that verse. First of all, any voice of condemnation that 
we hear in our hearts is always from Satan. The Holy Spirit convicts us 
of specific sins, but He never condemns us saying that we are useless or 
that there is no hope for us, etc. Secondly, we must never preach God’s 
Word in such a way that people feel condemned after they have heard us. 
They must always feel encouraged and believe that there is hope even for 
the worst of them. Thirdly, when we witness to non-Christians, it must 
not be to condemn them but to save them. In my younger days, I used 
to give out many tracts on the streets and in the trains and buses. I did 
this to clear my hands of their blood. I wasn’t aiming to save them; and 
I certainly wasn’t willing to die for any of them like Jesus did. Each time 
I gave a tract, I was (silently) saying, “Now I have given you a tract. Your 
blood  is  not  on  my  hands.”  I  gave  them  tracts  to  ease  my  conscience  
so that they could not point to me and say that I did not give them the 
gospel. I didn’t want them to say to me in the final day, “You never told 
me about Jesus”. But I’ve discovered that that is not the way to evange-
lise. God sent His Son to save people, not to condemn them. Now I would 
rather give out one tract and save one person than give out 1000 tracts 
and save none.
In 3:30, we read John the Baptist’s life-motto: “He (Christ) must increase 
but I must decrease.” We do well to make that our life’s motto as well.
In Chapter 4, we read of Jesus’ visit to Samaria. Jesus and His disci-
ples were walking and came to Samaria and they were all hungry. If we 
went as an evangelistic team into a town and were hungry, what would 
we do? We would all go together to a restaurant and eat some food. But 
here we see Jesus feeling a prompting from the Holy Spirit to stay there 
by the wayside and not to go to the restaurant. So He told His disciples, 
“You  go  and  eat  and  bring  some  food  for  me.”  While  He  was  waiting  
there a woman came, and through her the whole city came to hear about 
Jesus.  Jesus  listened  to  the  promptings  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  So  did  the  
apostles.  Philip  was  told  to  leave  a  revival  in  Samaria  and  to  go  to  the  
desert. When he obeyed, he met an Ethiopian eunuch who got converted 
and  took  the  gospel  to  Ethiopia  where  thousands  got  converted.  There  
have been Christians in Ethiopia for 2000 years, because Philip listened 
to  the  voice  of  the  Holy  Spirit  that  day.  And  because  Philip  faithfully  
walked those many hours into the desert, God gave him a free trip back 
to his home, by lifting him up and transporting him (Acts 8). Peter was 
prompted while praying to go to Cornelius’ house (where he had no plans 
to go) (Acts 10).
Jesus  asked  the  Samaritan  woman  to  call  her  husband (4:16).  The  
woman said she didn’t have one. Jesus replied, “That’s right, you don’t 
have any husband. You have had five husbands, and the one you are 
living with now is not your husband” (4:18). Now she was really embar-
rassed  and  immediately  changed  the  subject  and  began  to  ask  Jesus  
about  worship  (verse  20).  And  here  we  see  the  graciousness  of  Jesus.  

Doing the Will of God                                                                                                                               619
John
He sensed her embarrassment and changed the subject Himself. He was 
full of grace and truth. If you allow the Holy Spirit to show you the glory 
of Jesus here, He will change you into His likeness.
It is amazing that Jesus spoke the elementary truths of salvation to a 
bishop (John 3) and the most profound truths on worship to a 5-times 
divorced sinful woman (Chapter 4). Obviously Jesus saw more hunger in 
her for the truth than in the bishop. The Father in heaven is seeking all 
over the world for true worshippers “who will worship in spirit and in truth 
(reality)”. Under the old covenant, people could worship only in their body 
and soul – with hand-clapping and emotions etc. Many worship God only 
like that even today. But Jesus said that the time was coming when the 
real worshippers would worship in their spirit as well. This time has now 
come after Jesus’ death when the veil in front of the Most Holy Place was 
rent and man could go right into God’s presence and offer his body as a 
living sacrifice which would result in “worship in the spirit” (Romans 12:1 
- NASB).
Doing the Will of God
Jesus then told His disciples two things. First: “My food is to do the will of 
Him Who sent Me and to finish His work” (4:34). His food was not to run 
around and do “something for God”, but to do exactly what His Father 
wanted Him to do. Secondly, He told His disciples to lift up their eyes and 
look at the harvest that was ready for reaping (verse 35).
Some are called to sow and some to reap (4:36). My ministry has basi-
cally  been  reaping.  Jesus  said,  “I  sent  you  to  reap  where  other  people  
have laboured.” (4:38). William Carey came to India 200 years ago and 
suffered  much  and  sowed  much.  Other  godly  missionaries  have  come  
since  then  and  worked  hard  and  sown  and  sown  and  seen  very  little  
fruit. But today, when I go to the remote villages of Tamilnadu, I reap a 
harvest from what these missionaries sowed. They will get a far greater 
reward than I will ever get, because they worked for years and saw very 
little or no fruit. The evangelist goes forth and brings people to Christ. 
He must then hand over his converts to a teacher and shepherd to build 
them into a body. There is no competition here. Some pastors say, “You 
are stealing my sheep.” They are God’s sheep, not yours or mine. If they 
are your sheep, they will all go to hell. Only the Lord’s sheep go to heaven. 
I remember hearing the story of an evangelist who met a drunkard on a 
street once. The drunkard said, “Do you recognise me? I am one of your 
converts.”  The  evangelist  said,  “You  must  certainly  be  my  convert,  not  
the  Lord’s  convert,  if  you  are  in  this  drunken  state!”  Nobody  has  ever  
stolen my sheep because I don’t have any. They are all the Lord’s sheep. 
And if they can find better pasture in some other church, I won’t stop 
them from going there. Neither should you. Don’t ever be possessive of 
the Lord’s sheep as if they were your personal property.

620 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Eternal God

In 4:46–54, we read of a royal official from Capernaum whose son was 
sick.  He  came  to  Cana  to  meet  Jesus.  Jesus  told  him,  “Go  your  way.  
Your son lives.” When he went home and asked the servants when the 
child got better, they said, “Yesterday at 1 o’clock in the afternoon.” So 
the official actually reached his home only the next day. Being a royal 
official, he would undoubtedly have come to Cana in a chariot. Since 
the distance to Capernaum was only 25 kilometres, he could have easily 
reached home in 2 or 3 hours at the most. But he didn’t go back the same 
day. He slept the night in Cana and went home the next morning! Who 
would do that when a child is seriously sick at home? There we see his 
faith in Jesus’ words that his child had been healed. So he did not need 
to rush home. Do we have such faith, that when Jesus says “Your son is 
well”, you believe it and don’t have to rush home to confirm it?
In Chapter 5, we read: “In Bethesda lay a multitude of people who were 
sick, blind, lame and withered” (5:3). That is a description of many churches 
today: In them are a great multitude of spiritually blind, sick, lame and 
withered believers. Jesus has to come and heal them. One man had been 
lying  there  for  38  years.  The  period  of  38  years  was  the  length  of  time  
that God punished the Israelites with wandering, for not entering Canaan: 
“The time it took to come from Kadesh-barnea (the border of Canaan) until 
we  crossed  over  was  38  years,  until  all  the  men  of  war  perished, 
as the LORD had sworn” (Deuteronomy 2:14). This lame man symbolises 
believers who are defeated and unable to walk in victory over sin. He had 
tried for 38 years to get into the pool as soon as the angel stirred the water. 
But he failed every year and finally gave up. This is a picture of life under 
the law. You try and try for victory but always fail and finally give up. Then 
Jesus comes, and you enter into victory in a moment. This miracle is a 
sign and a parable. In the wilderness, during those 38 years, all the men 
of  war  died.  Man’s  efforts  and  energy  have  to  die.  The  Lord  waits  until  
we reach a zero point, before He comes. In 5:14, Jesus warned this man 
not to sin again lest he get a worse sickness. So this man’s sickness was 
caused by sin. Some sicknesses are caused by sin and cannot be healed 
until the sin is confessed and set right and cleansed.
When the Jews asked Jesus why He was healing people on the Sabbath 
day, He replied, “Because My Father is working on the Sabbath” (5:17). 
God the Father does not have any Sabbath-holiday now. The only Sabbath 
God ever had was the one mentioned in Genesis 2:2, before man fell into 
sin.  Ever  since,  God  has  been  working,  because  man  has  fallen.  And  
so Jesus said, “I don’t have any Sabbath either. My Father works and I 
work.” Jesus was a full time worker – He worked 24 hours a day, 7 days 
a week. Satan works “day and night” too – accusing the saints (Revelation 
12:11).  God  wants every  child  of  His  to  be  equally  wholehearted  and  
available to Him – even if they are working in a secular job.
In 5:30,  Jesus  said,  “I  never  do  anything  on  My  own  initiative.”  That  
means that He always waited on His Father to know what to do. He did 

Doing the Will of God                                                                                                                               621
John
things when His Father told Him to. That was why He never turned stones 
into bread, even though He was very hungry – His Father had not told 
Him to do that. This is how we are to live too. This does not mean that we 
wait for vocal commands from heaven all the time. The Holy Spirit within 
us speaks to us by prompting us in our spirit to do something and also 
by restraining us in our spirit from doing something else.
In 5:34,  41,  Jesus  said,  “I do not receive testimony from men.... I do 
not receive glory from men.” Jesus was satisfied with the testimony that 
His Father gave about Him. He didn’t want anyone else’s testimony. In 
5:44, He said that it is the desire to receive glory from man that hinders 
us from having a living faith. Do you want to be a man/woman of faith? 
Then decide once for all that you will never again seek for honour from 
any man. Don’t seek for theological degrees to impress people. Satan is 
not scared of anyone with theological degrees. In the secular world, you 
need those degrees because it is only thus that you can get a job. But in 
the Lord’s work, it serves no purpose at all. It is faith that you need in 
the Lord’s work.
In 6:37, Jesus said, “All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and 
the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out.” Two statements in 
this verse helped me greatly – one in my life and the other in my ministry. 
The second half of this verse gave me perfect assurance of my salvation 
in July 1959. I had been tossed about, unsure of my salvation, for about 
6 years prior to that time. But on that day, I believed this word from the 
Lord and it was like dropping an anchor. I never doubted my salvation 
after that.
The first half of that verse helped me in my ministry. I realised that all 
those whom I am called by God to serve will come to me. So I don’t have 
to go around grabbing people from here and there. God has many serv-
ants on earth and He allots who all each servant is to serve. I should not 
grab someone who was allotted by God to someone else. That would be 
stealing. If God has determined that a brother should be shepherded 
by another leader, then if I am in fellowship with God, I should support 
that and encourage him to go to that church, and not to mine. This has 
brought great rest to me.
In 6:38, we have the clearest description (in a single sentence) of why 
Jesus came to earth: “I came from heaven not to do My own will (that is, 
“to deny My own will”) but to do the will of Him who sent Me.” That shows 
us that as a human being, He had a will of His own that needed to be 
denied. To take up the cross means to deny one’s own will. In heaven He 
could  always  do  His  own  will  because  it  was  the  same  as  His  Father’s  
will. But His coming in our flesh basically means that He thereby got a 
human will that was different from His Father’s will – and which therefore 
had to be denied all the time. This becomes very clear in Gethsemane. 

622 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Eternal God
John
There Jesus’ own human will was not to drink the cup. But the Father’s 
will  was  that  he  should  drink  the  cup.  So  He  denied  His  own  will  and  
did the Father’s will. That is what He had done all His life prior to that 
moment, as well. He did not come to earth merely to die for our sins. He 
came to deny His own will (as a man) and to do the will of His Father. 
One part of the Father’s will was to die for our sins. Another part was to 
be an Example for us to follow for 33½ years of His life. He said “No” to 
His human will and “Yes” to His Father’s will every single moment of His 
earthly life. That was why He never sinned.
All temptation is essentially to make you do your own will. If you say 
“No” to your own will, you deny yourself and die to your self-life (you take 
up the cross). Then you overcome temptation and get the victory. Then 
you will do the Father’s will. It is here that we all need the power of the 
Holy Spirit – to put our own will to death. To “crucify the flesh” (Galatians 
5:24) means just this: to “put your own will to death”. You cannot do that 
in your own strength, but you can do it all the time in the power of the 
Holy Spirit. David couldn’t kill Goliath without God’s power and Samson 
couldn’t kill the lion without God’s power. And you can’t put your flesh 
to death without God’s power either. But with God’s power you can. And 
that is why you need to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
Improving Quality and Decreasing Quantity
Chapter 6 begins with a great multitude (verse 2), and ends with 11 people 
(verse 70). If you want to know how to improve the quality of your church 
and reduce its size, you can learn from Jesus in this chapter. Of course, 
most  preachers  and  pastors  would  not  be  interested  in  that,  because  
they  are  always  interested  in  increasing  their  numbers.  Jesus  was  a  
great Master at improving quality and decreasing quantity. God reduced 
Gideon’s  army  by  99%  from  33,000  to  300,  before  Gideon  could  have  
God’s  presence  with  him  that  assured  him  of  victory.  God  has  always  
accomplished His purposes with a chosen few. Here we see how Jesus 
did it. He preached being crucified with Him (= eat My flesh and drink My 
blood – verse 56). This offended most people in this great multitude and 
most of His disciples left Him saying, “This is a difficult statement” (verses 
60, 66). And Jesus never asked any of them to stay. He even turned to 
the  12  who  were  left  and  asked  them  if  they  also  wanted  to  go.  Jesus’  
attitude  was,  “If  anyone  is  offended  with  the  message  of  the  cross  and  
wants to leave Me, he can go. I won’t stop him. But I am not going to lower 
the qualifications for discipleship to suit anyone’s tastes.” What powerful 
churches we would have had on earth if every preacher had that attitude.
Today, preachers invite people to come to Jesus to be blessed financially 
and to be healed physically. Who will not want to come to a “Jesus” who 
offers  you  such  things.  But  that  is  “another  Jesus”.  Many  believers  who  
don’t preach prosperity still believe that that is the mark of God’s blessing 

Improving Quality and Decreasing Quantity                                                                                        623

on them. This is a deception. Look at the multitudes of crooked business-
men of every religion who are making money and imagining that God has 
blessed  them!  There  is  only  one  mark  of  God’s  blessing  –  that  you  are  
becoming more and more like Christ. The real Jesus invites us to “Come 
and die.” Not many are attracted to such a message. That is not surpris-
ing, because Jesus said that only few will find the way to life  (Matthew 
7:14). But those few will build the church. They may face a lot of suffer-
ing and misunderstanding and tribulation on earth, as Jesus said (John 
16:33). But they will do a work for God on earth that lasts for all eternity.
In 7:1,  we  see  how  we  must  use  our  commonsense.  Because  people  
wanted  to  kill  Jesus  in  Judea,  He  did  not  go  there.  We  should  not  go  
unnecessarily to some place where there is a risk to our life. Yet a few 
verses later, we read that Jesus went to Judea, because He sensed that 
His Father wanted Him to go there. We must be willing to go anywhere, if 
God leads us there. Then we can trust Him to protect us.
In 7:5 we read that Jesus’ own brothers did not believe in Him. They 
despised Him. But after He was raised from the dead, James and Jude 
believed in Him and even wrote two epistles. Here we read Jesus’ broth-
ers  asking  Him  whether  He  would  be  going  to  Jerusalem  for  the  feast.  
He  replied  that  He  could  not,  like  them,  go  anywhere  any  time  He  felt  
like. He had to wait for His Father’s prompting. Since He had no such 
prompting as yet, He was not going. Jesus also told them that the world 
hated Him because He spoke out against its sin, whereas those who did 
not  speak  out  against  sin  would  be  popular  with  the  world.  That  is  a  
word for all preachers. You can be a popular preacher if you don’t preach 
against sin. Jesus was unpopular because He spoke out against pride, 
hypocrisy, the love of money, immorality, impure thoughts, greed, anger, 
and  jealousy.  The  world  will  hate  anyone  who  preaches  against  these  
sins today as well.
After  His  brothers  had  left,  He  suddenly  decided  to  go  for  the  feast  
Himself. Did He tell them a lie when He said a few moments earlier that 
He was not going. No. Jesus waited for orders from the Father and He got 
those orders only a few minutes after His brothers had left for Jerusalem. 
Then He went – and He was not bothered by the thought that his brothers 
would now think he was a liar! They couldn’t understand that He lived 
by moment-by-moment leading from heaven. He lived His life like police-
men who have a radio-phone with them – with which they are constantly 
connected to their Central Control Room. That phone is always on. And 
they  can  go  to  any  place  only  when  ordered  to  do  so  by  headquarters.  
The  Father  did  not  want  Jesus  to  go  with  His  brothers  to  Jerusalem,  
and waste the time in useless gossip and conversation along the way. At 
times the Lord may tell you not to go with some brother, because he will 
waste your time with useless talk. Then it is better to travel alone.
In 7:24, we see a balance where Jesus said, “Don’t judge...but judge”. 
We  must  not  judge  anyone  by  their  outward  appearance.  But  we  must  

624 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Eternal God
John
judge  righteously.  We  are  permitted  to  judge  only  those  over  whom  the  
Lord has given us authority – for example a parent over his children, a 
supervisor  over  his  workers,  an  elder  over  the  members  of  his  church.  
If  we  go  outside  those  boundaries  and  judge  others,  then  it  is  unright-
eous judgement. We must also not judge merely by what our eyes see or 
our  ears  hear  (Isaiah  11:3).  We  must  make  careful  investigation  before  
making  a  judgement  (Deuteronomy  13:14; 19:18).  Jesus  also  told  us  to  
judge a person’s fruits (outward conduct) to see whether he was a false 
prophet or a true one (Matthew 7:15, 16). So we see that the Lord did not 
put  a  blanket  ban  on  all  judgement.  If  He  had  done  that,  we  would  be  
deceived by false prophets and never be able to discipline anyone in the 
churches.
In 8:1–12, we read the beautiful story of the woman caught in adultery 
whom  the  Pharisees  wanted  to  stone.  There  are  many  Pharisees  today  
too whose pockets are always full of stones to be thrown at others. Many 
preachers fling stones at people when they preach. Jesus never has any 
stone  to  throw  at  anyone.  He  always  had  compassion  on  people  who  
sinned. We never see Jesus in the gospels criticising murderers, thieves 
and adulterers. But we do see Him condemning the Pharisees and reli-
gious hypocrites in the synagogues to hell. But to the woman caught in 
adultery, He said, “I don’t condemn you. Don’t sin again” (8:11). In those 
two sentences we have the full gospel – justification and sanctification. 
Jesus  had  told  the  Pharisees,  “He  who  is  without  sin,  let  him  cast  the  
first stone” (8:7). So whenever you are tempted again to throw a stone at 
someone, remind yourself of two things:
1. The pit from which God pulled you out; and 
2. The sin that still dwells in your flesh today. 
Then you will empty your pockets of all your stones. You will never be 
able to throw a stone at anyone thereafter. 
You may then ask, “But what about those who are deceiving poor people 
and swindling them of their money. Shouldn’t we expose such preachers 
or is that also throwing stones?” The Bible says, “Speak evil of no man” 
(Titus 3:2). So we must not speak evil of anyone. But we can certainly say 
that his  teaching  and  practices  are  un-Scriptural  and  that  Jesus  would  
never do such things. We can point out the serious errors in his doctrine 
or his ministry without ever speaking evil of the man himself. If you want 
to preserve yourself and keep your mouth holy for the Lord to preach His 
Word through, then be careful not to speak evil of people. At the same 
time, be discerning about the ministry of everyone.

The Truth Shall Make You Free                                                                                                               625
John
The Truth Shall Make You Free
In 8:32, the Lord gave us a guideline to find out whether what we are 
hearing is the truth: “You shall know the truth and the truth shall make 
you  free.”  If  what  you  have  received  is  the  truth,  it  will  set  you  free.  
Anything  that  leaves  you  in  bondage  or  brings  more  bondage  or  fear  
or guilt or condemnation into your life is not the truth but a lie. Don’t 
receive  it.  The  context  here  is  about  being  free  from  sin  (8:33,  34).  We  
must  belong  to  a  church  where  the  word  of  God  is  setting  people  free  
from  sin.  I  want  to  listen  to  a  man  whose  preaching  sets  me  free  from  
sin – in my thoughts, words, actions, attitudes and motives. That’s how 
I know if a man is preaching the truth. That’s the way to test the truth, 
and not just by checking his doctrinal statement.
In 8:44, the Lord told the Pharisees (whose doctrines were all correct) 
that they belonged to their father, the devil. Jesus said that the devil was 
a murderer and a liar. If you tell a lie, Satan is the father of that lie and 
you are the mother of that lie.
Jesus said, “We must work the works of Him who sent Me as long as 
it is day; night is coming when no one can work” (9:4). This is an impor-
tant  word  for  us  who  live  in  India  today.  We  must  make  use  of  every  
opportunity while there is the opportunity to preach the gospel and make 
disciples.  The  night  is  coming  soon,  when  we  will  not  be  able  to  work.  
Jesus then went on to say what that work was. As long as He was in the 
world, He was the light of the world (9:5). But now that He has gone away 
from the world, our task is to be the light of the world (Matthew 5:14). We 
have to manifest the light (meaning His life) to the world.
In 10:9, Jesus said, “I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will 
be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.”  After  a  person  has  
entered through the door and been saved what should he do? He must go 
into God’s presence and out into the world to serve, and then come back 
into God’s presence and go out again to serve Him. That is the balanced 
Christian life. It’s not that we ever lose God’s presence. But we must take 
time to be alone with God and not be busy “going out” all the time. That 
would be like walking on just one leg all the time. A balanced Christian 
has two legs. He worships God and he serves, as Jesus said in Matthew 
4:10 also.
In 10:28, 29 we have the verses that those who preach eternal security 
misquote. Jesus said, “And I give eternal life to them, and they will never 
perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has 
given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out 
of the Father’s hand.” That is a beautiful picture of perfect eternal secu-
rity – and I believe in it with all my heart. But notice that verse 28 begins 
with the word “And”. So it is connected to the previous sentence which 
tells  us  clearly  who  are  the  ones  to  whom  Jesus  promises  this  eternal  
security. It is not to everyone who claims to be a believer. “My sheep hear 
My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give eternal life to 

626 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Eternal God
John
them.” I believe this also with all my heart that eternal security is prom-
ised only to those who are His sheep, who hear His voice (meaning that 
they obey it) and follow Him. What about those who don’t listen to Jesus 
and don’t follow Him? There is certainly no eternal security for them. This 
is another example of how many Christians preach wrong doctrines by 
taking half a statement in Scripture or by quoting verses out of context. 
It is true that no-one can pluck us out of the Father’s hand. But we can 
jump out of the Father’s hand ourselves. God doesn’t force anyone to go 
to heaven or to follow Jesus.
Dead to the World and Alive to God
In Chapter  11,  we  read  the  story  of  Lazarus  of  Bethany.  When  Jesus  
heard that Lazarus was sick, He waited for some days and finally arrived 
at  Bethany  four  days  after  Lazarus  had  died.  God’s  ways  are  not  our  
ways. Jesus moved in implicit obedience to His Father and so He did not 
go anywhere until He had freedom in His spirit to go. This miracle also 
was  a  sign.  What  is  the  spiritual  lesson  here?  God  empowers  us  only  
when we come to a zero point. A sick man can still do certain things. So 
the Lord waits until Lazarus dies, and cannot even lift a little finger. And 
then Jesus came. Some of us are so strong that the Lord does not come 
to help us. He has to wait. You may ask Him to help you. And He will help 
you – but not yet, for you are still too strong. Paul said, “When I am weak, 
then I am strong.” We have to come to an end of trusting in our own abil-
ities.  Do  you  want  to  understand  the  Bible?  Acknowledge  that  you  are  
stupid in spiritual matters. Do you want spiritual power? Acknowledge 
that you are weak. Don’t just acknowledge it. Recognise it.
Why do we get angry so easily? We think that it is because we are so 
weak.  But  that  is  not  true.  It  is  because  we  are  too  strong.  If  we  were  
really  weak,  we  wouldn’t  get  angry  at  all.  Consider  a  sick  man  who  is  
taken to a hospital. The first day he loses his temper and complains 
about  the  nurses  and  the  doctors  and  the  food.  The  next  day,  he  is  a  
little more sick and his voice becomes weaker, and so he doesn’t shout 
in anger so often. A week later, with tubes in his veins and his nose, he 
loses his temper only once in a while. Finally, when he becomes totally 
weak, he never loses his temper at all. He shouted in anger when he was 
strong. And he stopped shouting in anger when he became weak. This is 
what we can learn from the story of Lazarus too.
Again  we  see  the  Lord  asking  the  people  in  Bethany  to  do  the  easy  
part – roll the stone away. Then He did the difficult part – raising Lazarus 
from  the  dead.  After  that,  the  people  were  again  asked  to  do  the  easy  
part  –  remove  his  grave  clothes  and  set  him  free.  The  new  covenant  is  
a  partner  ship  with  Jesus  Christ.  We  take  His  yoke  upon  us  and  work  
together with Him. We do the easy part and He does the difficult part. 
This is the secret of effective ministry.

Dead to the World and Alive to God                                                                                                     627
John
In 12:24–26, we see the secret of fruitfulness. We have to fall into the 
ground  and  die  as  a  grain  of  wheat  falls  into  the  ground  and  dies.  If  
it  does  not  die,  it  will  be  alone.  If  it  dies  it  will  bring  forth  much  fruit.  
Jesus Himself has given us an example in this area. This is the way of the 
cross which is hardly spoken of in Christendom today. We must take up 
the cross every day and proclaim this way to others as well – the way of 
dying to our reputation, our honour and our own choices. The secret of 
overcoming sin is also here. Dead people can’t sin. If you kick or insult a 
dead man, he won’t respond in any way. Even if you praise him, he won’t 
respond.  This  is  how  we  are  called  to  live:  “Consider yourself dead...” 
(Romans 6:11). This is a very blessed place to be in – where the praises 
and criticisms of men don’t affect us in any way, because we are dead to 
the world and alive only unto God.
Bible-knowledge is good; but that alone will not bring forth fruit. Even 
Satan knows the Bible. If you are filled with the Holy Spirit as well, then 
that is even better. But that also won’t bring forth much fruit. It’s good for 
the rain to fall, but any amount of rain will not produce a crop. There has 
to be a seed in the ground that has died. This is the most oft- repeated 
statement of Jesus in the gospels. It is repeated seven times in the gospels 
in one way or the other: “He who loves his life will lose it and he who hates 
his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.” (12:25). If you seek to save 
your earthly life, your reputation, your ambitions, etc. then at the end of 
your life you will be a frustrated, discouraged man. But if you are willing 
to give it all up for the Lord and for the gospel’s sake, you will find eternal 
fruit waiting for you when you end your life on earth.
In 12:42, 43, we read the reason why many today do not proclaim the 
whole counsel of God and stand for Him: “Many of the rulers believed in 
Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him, lest they 
should be put out of the synagogue; for they loved the approval of men 
more than the approval of God.”
In 13:5, we see Jesus at the end of His life, at the feet of His disciples, 
washing them. That is a good example for us to keep in mind and follow, 
because  we  hardly  see  any  examples  like  that  today.  Most  Christian  
leaders want to sit on people’s heads and not at their feet!
In 13:7 is a word that we can receive comfort from in situations where 
we cannot understand why God has permitted us to face some difficult 
situation. The Lord says to us, “You don’t understand now why I’m doing 
this. But you will understand later.”
What is the identifying mark of God’s people? It is not carrying a Bible, 
speaking  in  tongues,  having  a  cross  on  our  church  building  or  any  
such thing. It is love. Jesus said, “All men will know you are My disci-
ples  when  you  love  one  another”  (13:34,  35).  If  you  cannot  love,  you  
have disobeyed the one and only new commandment that Jesus gave. 
I am not talking here about loving believers who speak your language, 

628 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Eternal God
John
or  who  agree  with  you  or  who  have  the  same  ministry  as  you  have.  
That is easy. Your love will be tested when you have to love a believer 
who  is  born  again,  but  who  is  from  a  different  community,  or  who  
dis  agrees  with  you,  or  who  has  a  different  ministry  from  yours.  We  
must  learn  to  love  people  who  don’t  love  us,  who  don’t  give  us  gifts  
and who don’t praise us but criticise us. Then we will know whether 
we have the love of God or not. Human love requires a response from 
the other person. But divine love is unique in this way that it does not 
require a response. God keeps on loving whether man responds or not. 
And God can flood my heart with His love.
Greater Works
In 14:12, Jesus said, “He who believes in Me the works that I do he will do 
also.” Can every believer do the works that Jesus did? Yes – if we under-
stand what Jesus meant. He was not saying that all believers would raise 
the dead or walk on water. He was saying that all believers would be able 
to do the will of God (whatever it was for their own lives) – because all 
the works Jesus did in His entire life on earth could be summed up in 
one phrase: “The will of God” (John 6:38). When His mother told Him to 
bring her water from the well, He went and brought back a full bucket of 
water immediately. He worked hard in the carpenter’s shop and earned 
His living and helped the poor people around him. He loved His broth-
ers  who  irritated  Him  for  more  than  20  years  in  His  home.  We  can  do  
these works too. When He was a little boy, He helped Mary look after His 
younger brothers and sisters. As a mother, you can do the works Jesus 
did by looking after your children. If God calls you to preach, He will give 
you the power to preach. And if one day, God calls you to raise the dead, 
He will give you the power to raise the dead too.
Then Jesus said, “Greater works than these shall he do” (14:12). Does 
this  mean  that  each  believer  will  raise  25  people  from  the  dead,  when  
Jesus  raised  only  3?  No.  Jesus  did  not  say  “more  works,”  but  “greater 
works”. What was the one thing that Jesus could not do during His entire 
3½ years of His ministry? He could not make two disciples one with each 
other. All twelve of them were fighting to be the leader at the last supper. 
This was not due to any fault in Jesus. It was because they did not have 
the  Holy  Spirit  dwelling  within  them.  Only  after  the  Holy  Spirit  came,  
could  believers  become  one.  This  was  the  greater  work  Jesus  referred  
to – the building of the church as one body. Albert Einstein was a great 
scientist.  Compared  to  him,  we  are  all  quite  ignorant.  But  we  can  do  
mathematical calculations today faster than Einstein could – because we 
have access to computers. We have greater facilities than he had in his 
day. In the same way, we are not greater than Jesus. But with the Holy 
Spirit  having  come  to  dwell  within  us  now,  we  have  greater  resources  
to bring believers to oneness than Jesus had. Of course, it was because 

The Coming of the Holy Spirit                                                                                                                 629
John
Jesus laid down his life that we have the Holy Spirit Who enables us to 
do this greater work.
In 14:15, Jesus tells us the right motive for obedience under the new 
covenant. Under the old covenant the motive for obedience was the fear 
of punishment and the hope of reward (see Deuteronomy 28: “If you obey 
God, you will be blessed. If you don’t obey God you will be cursed.”). That 
is the way we make our children obey us: “If you obey Daddy you will get 
a chocolate. If you don’t obey Daddy, you will get a stick.” But we don’t 
make our grown sons obey with a chocolate and a stick. We want them 
to obey us out of love. In the new covenant, the Lord treats us like grown 
up sons and not like little children. So He says, “If you love Me keep My 
commandments”  (14:15).  If  we  don’t  love  the  Lord,  then  our  obedience  
becomes mere dead works.
The Coming of the Holy Spirit
In Chapters  14  to  16,  Jesus  speaks  at  length  about  the  coming  of  the  
Holy  Spirit  and  about  His  ministry.  In  14:16,  He  called  the  Holy  Spirit  
a “Helper” and “Friend” (MSG). This is our greatest need – a Helper and 
a Friend. Jesus said that when the Spirit is come, we will no longer be 
orphans (14:18). In 15:26, 27, He said that the Holy Spirit would back 
us up as we witness for Him. That means that when we get up to preach, 
the  Holy  Spirit  will  speak  to  people’s  hearts  and  say,  “Listen  to  that.  
That is from God.” What a difference that can make in our ministry. It 
is the Holy Spirit’s job to convict people in the world of their sin – as we 
preach (16:8). Then in 16:13, Jesus said that the Spirit would guide us 
into all the truth – that refers first of all to the truth about God and Jesus 
revealed in the Scriptures; and secondly to all the truth about ourselves – 
our sin, our self-righteousness, our selfishness, our pride and every area 
of un-Christlikeness that there is in us.
Then in 16:33, Jesus said, “In the world you have tribulation, but take 
courage; I have overcome the world.” He made it clear that His disciples 
would face tribulation, persecution and suffering from the world. He did 
not promise us prosperity and ease. But He said He had overcome the 
world  and  so  we  need  not  be  afraid.  What  was  “the  world”  that  Jesus  
overcame? The world is defined in 1 John 2:16 as “the lust of the flesh, 
the  lust  of  the  eyes  and  the  pride  of  life.”  This  is  what  Jesus  overcame  
–  because  He  was  tempted  in  all  points  as  we  are  and  yet  did  not  sin  
(Hebrews 4:15). Now we can follow in His footsteps and overcome as He 
did (See Revelation 3:21).
In Chapter 17, we have the longest prayer in the New Testament – and 
in it we see the burden of Jesus’ heart. In verse 2, we read, “Father, You 
gave Me authority over all flesh, all mankind, to give them eternal life.” 
This  is  a  good  word  for  leaders  to  meditate  on.  Why  does  God  give  us  
authority  over  other  believers?  It  is  not  to  rule  over  them,  or  to  make  

630 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Eternal God
John
them serve me, but to lead them to eternal life – the life of God Himself – 
to make them partake of the Divine nature. And then in verse 3, He tells 
us  that  we  can  partake  of  that  eternal  life  only  through  knowing  God  
and Jesus Christ personally. In verse 9, He says, “I don’t pray on behalf 
of the world, but for these whom You have given Me.” There we see that 
our  primary  burden  of  prayer  must  be  not  for  the  world  but  for  God’s  
children.  Many  people  think  it  is  a  very  spiritual  thing  to  pray  for  the  
world. But Jesus did not. He prayed for His disciples because He wanted 
to bless the world through them.
God Loves Us as He Loves Jesus
In 17:10,  we  see  a  beautiful  exchange  –  that  we  can  also  do.  Here  we  
see the reason why Jesus had such tremendous authority in His life. He 
said, “Father, all that I have is Yours.” And the Father said (as it were), 
“All right. In that case, all that I have is Yours.” It is when we give our all 
to God that He commits His all to us as well.
17:23  is  one  of  the  loveliest  verses  in  the  whole  Bible.  “God  loves  us  
as He loves Jesus.” This is the greatest truth in the whole Bible and it 
revolutionised and changed my life when I was a young man. It delivered 
me from my insecurity, my inferiority complex, my jealousies, my spirit 
of  competition,  my  fears,  my  depression,  my  timidity  and  every  other  
wretched  complex  that  I  had  inherited  from  Adam.  This  verse  taught  
me that God would care for me as much and as tenderly as He cared for 
Jesus. Many verses tell us that God loves us. But this is the only verse 
that clearly tells us how much He loves us. 
In 18:11,  we  see  the  way  Jesus  looked  at  His  being  betrayed  and  
captured in Gethsemane. Peter saw it as the work of Judas and decided 
to attack with his sword. Jesus however saw it as a cup that His Father 
had  sent  to  Him.  Judas  Iscariot  was  only  the  messenger  who  brought  
the cup from the Father. It is wonderful to see this truth that the worst 
thing that someone can do to you if you love God, will only be a “cup from 
the Father”, because God is powerful enough to control everything that 
happens to His children (Romans 8:28).
In 18:36,  Jesus  told  Pilate,  “My  kingdom  is  not  of  this  world.  If  My  
kingdom were of this world My servants would fight.” Every believer who 
fights  for  something  earthly  (including  position  in  a  church)  thereby 
proves that his kingdom is of this world. A spiritual man fights spiritual 
battles “in the heavenlies” with Satan and his evil spirits, and not with 
human beings (Ephesians 6:12). Paul reminded Timothy about this “good 
confession  that  Jesus  made  before  Pontius  Pilate”,  when  he  told  him  to  
run away from the love of money (1 Timothy 6:6–14).
In 19:10, 11, when Pilate threatened Jesus saying, “Don’t you know that 
I have power to crucify you and power to release you?”, Jesus replied with 
a calm dignity, “You can have no power over Me except what My Father 

God Loves Us as He Loves Jesus                                                                                                             631
John
gives you.” This is the dignity with which we can face our enemies and 
persecutors on earth as well, for the Father loves us as He loved Jesus 
and cares for us as He cared for Jesus. Even if you are falsely accused and 
taken to court, remember that no magistrate or judge on earth can write 
a verdict against you as a child of God without your Heavenly Father’s 
permission. Only what your Father permits can happen to you. This is 
why  we  can  be  at  perfect  rest  in  our  hearts  at  all  times  and  conduct  
ourselves with dignity everywhere.
In 19:30, Jesus cried out saying “It is finished”. The entire work of our 
salvation was finished at that moment. The wrath of God against sin was 
finished because Jesus had taken our punishment and endured three 
hours of being forsaken by God on the cross. Immediately thereafter He 
went  to  paradise  for  three  days.  There  are  some  Bible-teachers  nowa-
days who teach a false doctrine that Jesus went down to Hell for three 
days after He was crucified. This is heresy. They equate Hades with Hell, 
because of a faulty translation of the word in the King James Version in 
Acts 2:31. Hades had two sections – Paradise and Hell (Luke 16:22, 23). 
Jesus went to the Paradise section along with the converted thief. 
In 19:31,  we  are  told  that  the  day  after  Jesus  died  was  a  “special 
Sabbath”  and  not  the  ordinary  Sabbath.  Jesus  was  crucified  on  the 
Passover  day.  The  day  after  that  was  always  a  special  Sabbath  day  –  
being the first day of “the feast of unleavened bread” (Leviticus 23:5–7). 
The regular Sabbath (Saturday) came on the day after that – making it 
two Sabbaths in a row that week. So Jesus was actually crucified on a 
Thursday (and not on a Friday as most Christians believe). It is only thus 
that He could have spent three nights (Thursday, Friday and Saturday 
nights)  in  “the  heart  of  the  earth”  (where  Paradise  was  located  at  that  
time), as He had said (Matthew 12:40).
In 20:11, we see Mary Magdalene waiting outside the tomb of Jesus. 
She was given the privilege of being the first human being to see the resur-
rected Jesus and the beginning of the new creation. Mary Magdalene had 
been  a  demon-possessed  sinner,  and  she  was  chosen  so  that  it  might  
be evident to all that “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.” 
In a world that values men, God chose a woman for that honour. Praise 
the Lord!
Many of us may wish that we could have seen the physically resurrected 
Jesus.  But  Jesus  told  Thomas  in  20:29,  “Because  you  have  seen  Me,  
have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed.” 
I don’t know why this is so. But I believe the words of Jesus that I am 
more blessed than Thomas and all those apostles because unlike them, 
I have believed in Him without ever having seen Him physically.
In 21:3, we see Peter saying “I am going fishing”. Peter felt that he had 
been a failure as an apostle and so was saying that he was going back 
to his fishing job permanently. Some of the other apostles also joined 
him. But if God wants you to be an apostle, then you will be a failure at 

632 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ – The Eternal God
John
every business that you put your hand to. So Peter failed that night as 
a fisherman too. They must have tried to catch fish for 11 hours – from 
6 pm to 5 am the next morning. They caught nothing. Then Jesus came 
and filled their boat with fish miraculously. This is the closing “sign” in 
John’s gospel. What is its significance? Just this that we have to come 
to an end of ourselves and finish with all confidence in ourselves before 
the Lord will come and meet our need – for victory over sin or whatever. 
We have to be defeated again and again, numerous times, until we are 
convinced that “without Jesus, we can do nothing” (John 15:5). This was 
the  most  important  lesson  that  the  Lord  wanted  to  teach  His  disciples  
through  all  the  signs  in  this  gospel.  If  the  Lord  were  to  give  us  victory  
before we came to that zero point, we would
1. be proud of our victory and
2. look  down  on  others  who  are  defeated  (imagining  that  we  got  our  
victory by our own ability).
It  is  no  use  being  pulled  out  by  the  Lord  from  a  100-foot  pit  called  
“Anger” only to fall into a 1000-foot pit called “Spiritual pride”. That would 
not be victory at all. The Lord wants to give us victory in such a way that 
we  will  not  be  proud  of  it  nor  look  down  on  others  who  are  defeated.  
To  accomplish  that,  He  allows  us  to  fail  repeatedly  many  hundreds  or  
thousands  of  times  before  leading  us  into  victory  and  “filling our boat 
with fish”.
In 21:15–17, we see the Lord re-commissioning Peter for His service. 
Peter had been amazed at the catch of 153 fish (verse 11). He may have 
been calculating in his mind how much money he could get for all those 
fish. He may have thought that if the Lord blessed Him like this every day, 
very soon he would be the richest fisherman in Galilee – and of course 
He would give 10% of His earnings for God’s work! As he was musing on 
the  blessings  of  this  “prosperity  gospel”  (!!),  Jesus  asked  him,  “Do  you  
love Me more than these (fish)?”  That  question  pierced  his  heart  like  a  
sword. He responds saying that he loved the Lord – but he used a weaker 
word  for  “love”  (phileo  –  the  love  of  a  man  for  his  friend)  than  the  one  
Jesus used (agape – the supreme love that a man should have for God). 
The Lord asked him the same question a second time. Again he replied 
that he had phileo-love for the Lord. The third time the Lord descended 
to  his  level  and  asked  him  if  he  had  at  least  phileo-love  for  Him.  Peter 
is no longer the proud, boastful man he was a few days earlier. He is so 
broken  and  uncertain  that  all  he  can  say  (as  it  were)  is,  “Lord,  I  really  
don’t know whether I love you even with phileo-love. You alone know my 
heart. You know all things. I think I love You, but You know.” Peter is not 
sure at all of his love, but he is sincere. And the Lord commissions him 
for His service right there, charging him to look after and feed His lambs 
and His sheep.

God Loves Us as He Loves Jesus                                                                                                             633
John
New-covenant  service  is  based  on  love  for  the  Lord.  The  Lord  wants  
only those who love Him with all their hearts (more than everything else), 
to serve Him. And that is the question He asks of us today as well.
In 21:18–23,  the  Lord  told  Peter  that  when  he  becomes  old,  he  will  
suffer  and  die  for  his  faith.  As  soon  as  Peter  heard  that,  he  looked  at  
John and asked, “Lord, what about this man? Will he also suffer and die 
like me or will he have a cushy time?” Jesus replied, “That is none of your 
business. I have called you to follow Me. You mind your own business.” 
We need to hear that word from the Lord. When you face difficulties and 
hardships in your ministry, do you compare your lot with that of other 
servants  of  the  Lord?  If  so,  the  Lord’s  word  to  you  is:  “Mind  your  own  
business and don’t compare your lot with that of others. You follow Me.”
All we have to do is follow Jesus – and we will finish our course with 
joy. May it be so for all of us. Amen.



ACTS OF THE APOSTLES
The Birth and Outreach of  
the Church
T
he Acts of the Apostles is a continuation of what was begun in the 
gospel of Luke. Luke is the author of this book too. He describes 
the gospel he wrote in these words, “The first account was about all 
that Jesus began to do and teach.” (1:1). The subject of Luke’s Gospel 
therefore was “All that Jesus began to do and teach”. By implication, the 
subject of the Acts of the Apostles is therefore “All that Jesus continued 
to do and teach – through His disciples”. And that has continued through 
2000 years right up to the present time. The story of Acts is an  unfinished 
story. There is no “Amen” at the end of Acts. And the last word in Acts 
is  ‘unhindered.’  The  gospel  of  Jesus  Christ  has  gone  forth  unhindered,  
despite all the opposition of Satan and evil men, for 2000 years and will 
continue to do until Christ returns. 
There is a principle we see in Acts.1:1 that we must bear in mind in all 
of our ministry: Jesus first did and only then did He teach. He preached 
only what He had already practised. He first did and then taught. This is 
the principle of all new-covenant service.
Under  the  old  covenant,  a  man  could  preach  what  he  had  not  lived  
out. But not under the new covenant. Even David (who wrote Scripture) 
would be disqualified for new-covenant service. Under the new-covenant, 
once a Christian who holds eldership in a church falls into adultery like 
David, although his sin can be forgiven and he can be restored to fellow-
ship  with  the  Lord  and  with  the  church,  he  cannot  become  an  elder  
again. The standard of leadership in the new covenant is very, very high. 
So it’s important that we follow this principle. Jesus continues to do and 
teach today through us. If we want to understand Acts, we must under-
stand the new covenant that God has established.

636 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
The Baptism in the Holy Spirit
In 1:5, we have a promise, “You shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.” 
When John the Baptist said, “You shall be baptised in the Holy Spirit,” 
they  immediately  thought  of  an  earthly  kingdom.  The  mind  of  an  old  
covenant person is always on earthly things. Even when many Christians 
say, “God has blessed me” they usually mean that He has blessed them 
materially – with money, or a good job, or a house. That is characteris-
tic of old covenant people. If you find that your thinking is like that, it 
would  indicate  that  you  are  an  old  covenant  Christian.  If  you  imagine  
that earthly blessing is the primary mark of God’s blessing, just think of 
the millions of people who are atheists who have got much more blessing 
than you – and you will see the folly of that way of thinking. The mark 
of new covenant blessing is that we become more and more like Christ.
The apostles were earthly-minded before the day of Pentecost. So when 
they were told by the Lord that they would soon be baptised in the Holy 
Spirit,  they  immediately  thought  that  they  would  be  getting  an  earthly  
kingdom. And so they asked, “Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the 
kingdom to Israel?” (1:6). The Lord replied, “No. That’s not what I meant. 
It’s  not  for  you  to  know  times  or  the  seasons  on  such  matters.  The  Lord  
has put all that in His own power” (verse 7). There are many who study 
the book of Revelation, seeking to discover the times for various end-time 
events. It’s not for us to know exactly when Jesus will come and set up 
His kingdom. But what we do need to know is the power of the Holy Spirit.
What is the identifying mark of being baptised in the Holy Spirit? Jesus 
made it crystal clear in Acts.1:8 that it was power. He never said a word 
about tongues being the evidence of the filling of the Holy Spirit. Neither 
did the apostles say a word about this. Yet many Christians today proclaim 
“speaking  in  tongues  (an  unlearned  language)”  as  the  “initial  evidence”, 
even though there is not a single verse in the Bible that teaches it.
We should never use the historical sections of the New Testament to 
determine  any  doctrine.  Acts  is  basically  a  historical  book.  Doctrine  
must be determined from the teachings of Jesus and the epistles only. 
Otherwise  we  can  go  wrong  –  because  Acts  tells  us  about  a  number  
of  things  that  the  apostles  did  that  were  wrong  –  Paul  circumcised  
Timothy  (Acts  16:3), Paul offered money for sacrifices and probably 
shaved his head too, to fulfil a religious ritual (Acts 21:23–26) and Paul 
and  Barnabas  had  a  sharp  disagreement  and  separated  from  each  
other  (Acts  15:39).  We  also  read  of  all  believers  selling  all  that  they  
owned and having “all things in common” at one time (Acts 2:44, 45). 
Many  Pentecostal  preachers  loudly  proclaim  that  since  “all  spoke  in  
tongues” then (in Acts 2:4), therefore all must speak in tongues today. 
But they do not preach something else written in the same chapter that 
since “all sold their property and had all things in common” then (Acts 
2:44), therefore all must sell everything they own and have all things 

The Birth of the Church                                                                                                                           637
Acts
in common today as well. They selectively choose from Acts what suits 
their  own  views  and  thereby  prove  that  they  are  dishonest  in  their  
handling of Scripture. So, as you can see, there can be a lot of confu-
sion if we get our doctrines from Acts. Our doctrines must come from the 
teachings of Jesus and the epistles alone.
It  is  certainly  God’s  will  that  every  Christian  should  have  power.  To  
have power does not mean that you will become a fiery evangelist. You 
will have power to fulfil your own ministry in the Body of Christ. Consider 
the human body. To be a member of our human body, blood must flow 
through  that  member.  An  artificial  hand  cannot  be  a  part  of  a  body 
because the blood doesn’t flow through it. In the same way, only where 
the blood of Christ has cleansed someone can that person be a part of 
Christ’s body. But even if the blood flows in an arm, it could still be para-
lysed – and therefore be a useless member. If the paralysis is healed, and 
the arm gets power, will it become a tongue? No! It will become a power-
ful arm. In the same way, if a paralysed tongue receives power, it won’t 
become an arm. It will become a powerful tongue. So if God has called 
you to be a mother and you get filled with the Holy Spirit, you won’t 
become an evangelist; you’ll become a powerful, Spirit-filled mother.
In 1:15, we read that 120 men and women gathered in the upper room 
waiting  for  the  Holy  Spirit.  But  we  know  that  more  than  500  believers  
saw Jesus after His resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:6). But out of the 500, 
only  120  waited!  Not  every  believer  was  interested  in  the  power  of  the  
Holy Spirit – even then. They were all happy to meet Jesus after He rose 
from  the  dead,  but  they  had  no  interest  in  being  baptised  in  the  Holy  
Spirit. Less than 25% of those believers waited for the Spirit’s power. We 
see such a disinterest in the Spirit’s power among believers today as well.
In 1:22, we see the apostles looking for a replacement for Judas Iscariot. 
They  looked  for  someone  who  could  be  “a  witness  of  Jesus’  resurrec-
tion”  along  with  them.  Notice  that  –  they  wanted  a  witness  of  Jesus’  
resurrection  and  not of His crucifixion.  Never  once  do  the  apostles  say  
that they are witnesses of Jesus’ crucifixion. They always say that they 
are “witnesses of His resurrection.” The gospel is incomplete without the 
resurrection of Christ. Most evangelists do not preach the resurrection 
as primary. They preach the crucifixion as primary. But the apostles 
preached  the  resurrection  primarily.  The  reason  why  many  Christians  
are gloomy is because even though they believe that Jesus rose up from 
the dead, they are not confessing it. Like those disciples on the road to 
Emmaus, they are gloomy and wear long faces. What a difference there 
was when they realised that Jesus had risen from the dead.
The Birth of the Church
Chapter 2: When those 120 people waited for the Holy Spirit, they did not 
know how long they would have to wait, because Jesus never told them. 

638 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
If they knew it would be only ten days, it would have been easier for them 
to wait. When God keeps us waiting for something, He does not usually 
tell us how long we have to wait for an answer. God wants us to live by 
faith,  because  that  is  the  only  way  to  grow  spiritually  –  and  waiting  is  
one way by which our faith is strengthened. If we knew how long we had 
to wait, then there would be no faith there. It is only afterwards when we 
look back that we can say, “I had to wait for three days (or three years)” 
for that.
If you had gone to those waiting disciples and asked them, “How will 
you  know  when  you  have  been  baptised  in  the  Holy  Spirit?”  –  they  
would not have said that they would speak in tongues. They would have 
said that Jesus had told them that they would receive power. You may 
ask “How will I know that I have received this power?” God can assure 
us  of  that,  just  like  He  assured  us  that  our  sins  were  forgiven.  The  
Holy Spirit, Who bears witness with our spirit that our sins have been 
forgiven will also bear witness that we have been endued with power. 
Ask God to give you the assurance for both these important matters.
So  they  were  waiting  for  power.  But  when  they  got  power  they  also  
received the gift of speaking in unknown languages (tongues). The tragedy 
today is that many who claim to have the gift of tongues do not seem to 
have any power. Tongues can be imitated, whereas power to overcome sin 
and to be a bold witness for Christ cannot be imitated. Consider this illus-
tration: You go to a shop to buy a computer (power). The shopkeeper tells 
you  that  a  free  CD  (tongues)  is  also  being  offered  with  every  computer.  
You didn’t go to the shop to buy a CD but a computer. But since the CD 
is being offered freely, you take both the computer and the CD. But now 
your  friend  sees  your  CD  and  goes  to  the  same  shop  and  pays  for  the  
computer but brings home only the free CD!! How foolish! That is a picture 
of those who received the gift of tongues but not the power.
We  read  that  a  noise  and  a  wind  filled  the  house  where  they  were 
praying and tongues as of fire rested on everyone’s head. These were only 
the  externals.  The  receiving  of  an  anointing  and  power  were  the  major  
events.  The  externals  were  different  when  Jesus  was  anointed.  In  His  
case, there was no wind or fire but a dove and a voice. But the power and 
anointing He received were the same as these apostles received. We all 
need to be “anointed with the Holy Spirit and power” as Jesus was (Acts 
10:38). The physical and emotional experiences may vary with each of us. 
If someone were to give you an expensive diamond as a gift, it wouldn’t 
make any difference if it came wrapped crudely in ordinary brown paper 
or in a shiny paper with fancy ribbons. It is the gift inside that is impor-
tant. Only babies are taken up with the wrappings, the externals – the 
wind, the fire, the noise, the tingling sensations, etc. Adults are taken up 
with the gift – the anointing and the power of the Holy Spirit. When people

Acts
testify  about  and  glory  in  the  wrapping  in  which  they  got  the  gift,  you  
know that they are still baby-Christians.
The tongues of fire that sat on everyone’s heads indicated that the most 
important part of our body that God would be using in the new covenant 
age would be the tongue – a tongue set on fire by the Holy Spirit and 
under His total control all the time. This is also part of the symbolism of 
the gift of tongues. God wants to use your tongue to bless others with, 
not only if you are a preacher, but also in your ordinary conversations 
with people every day. But for this, you must let the Holy Spirit have full 
control of your speech, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
In 2:14,  we  see  one  wonderful  result  of  the  Spirit  indwelling  all  the  
apostles.  We  read  here,  “Peter  stood  up,  backed  by  the  other  eleven” 
(MSG).  What  Jesus  could  not  accomplish  in  His  entire  lifetime  is  now  
accomplished  at  last:  The  twelve  are  all  one  body  now.  They  did  not  
compete to have the honour to preach. They supported Peter and were 
100% behind him as he spoke. This is the greater work that Jesus had 
said they would do after the Spirit came – the Holy Spirit had baptised 
them into one body.
In 2:17, Peter said that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit was the fulfil-
ment  of  the  prophecy  of  Joel.  All  men  and  women  could  now  have  the  
Spirit poured out on them and they could prophesy. This was a privilege 
reserved  only  for  kings  and  priests  under  the  old  covenant.  But  under  
the new covenant, all can receive the Spirit. We need to recognise what a 
tremendous honour this is. 
In 2:22, 23, we see the Spirit-filled Peter proclaiming the Lord Jesus as 
a Man, “Jesus the Nazarene, a Man attested to you by God.” In the very 
first gospel sermon ever preached, Jesus is proclaimed as a Man.
Jesus was always God and still is. That can never change. But 
once He became a Man, He is always a Man too. He never ceased to 
be God when He came to earth and He never ceased to be Man when 
He went back to heaven. He is fully God and fully Man even today.
In 1  Timothy  2:4,  5,  we  are  told  that  “there  is  one  mediator  between  
God  and  man,  the  Man  Christ  Jesus.”  The  Bible  never  calls  Him  the  
“God-Man”, as some Christians do. The Bible calls Him “the Man Christ 
Jesus.” And Peter, filled with the Spirit, is inspired by the Spirit to call 
Jesus “a Man” – because our Lord has identified Himself with our human-
ity completely and permanently. Hallelujah!
In 2:23, we read that Jesus’ crucifixion was according to “the prede-
termined  plan  and  foreknowledge  of  God”.  The  worst  thing  that  ever  
happened on this earth was the crucifixion of Christ – because there 
never  was  a  greater  crime  committed  on  this  earth  than  that.  And  
the best thing that ever happened on this earth was the crucifixion of 
Christ  –  because  that  alone  brought  redemption  to  man.  God  in  His  
foreknowledge turned the worst into the best. And this God is our God. 

640 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
By  His  almighty  power,  He  can  make  the  worst  things  that  the  devil  
does to us (either directly or through his agents) to be turned into the 
very best things for us – because God has a predetermined plan for us, 
His children, too.
In 2:38–40, when people were convicted of their sins when the first 
gospel  sermon  was  preached,  Peter  exhorted  them  to  “repent  and  be  
baptized  to  receive  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Spirit... and  be  saved  from 
this perverse generation.” These were the four things Peter preached 
– repentance,  water  baptism  (which  implied  faith),  baptism  in  the  Holy  
Spirit and separation from the spirit of this world. Today’s gospel preach-
ing does not include any of these four matters – and that is why there are 
so  many  “half-converted  believers”  sitting  in  churches.  Most  of  today’s  
evangelists don’t preach repentance, because if they did, they won’t get 
so  many  people  to  raise  their  hands  to  be  “saved”!!  They  don’t  preach  
water- baptism  because  that  would  offend  the  bishops  who  sit  behind  
them on the platform, who baptise infants in their churches. They don’t 
preach  the  baptism  in  the  Holy  Spirit  because  that  would  sound  too  
“Pentecostal”!  And  they  don’t  preach  separation  from  the  spirit  of  the  
world,  because  many  of  them  are  lovers  of  money  themselves!!  Peter,  
however, preached the whole counsel of God, because he was only inter-
ested in pleasing God. Be like Peter. 
In 2:42, we see the beginning of house-fellowships where the Body of 
Christ began to be built. Those who were saved continued in the apos-
tles’ teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread and prayer – obviously in 
small groups in different homes, because they did not have any build-
ings to meet in. And the Lord added to their number every day those 
who were saved (2:47). It’s the Lord who adds to the church. Our part 
is only to proclaim the undiluted, full gospel.
Working Two By Two
In 3:1, we see Peter and John working together. This had never happened 
before  the  day  of  Pentecost.  They  were  diametrically  opposed  to  each  
other in personality and were in competition with each other before this 
– as we saw in Peter’s closing comments about John in John 21:21. This 
was the unity that Jesus longed to see in them but never saw, because 
the Holy Spirit was not indwelling Peter and John then. In those days, 
John would always be with his brother James. Peter was also a part of 
the  inner  trio  of  Jesus,  but  John  and  James  tried  to  get  Peter  pushed  
out, and asked Jesus to reserve the two seats on either side of His future 
throne  for  both  of  them  alone!  But  things  have  changed  now  –  for  the  
Spirit  had  come.  No-one  is  seeking  his  own  now,  or  trying  to  promote  
himself. Peter and John who never fellowshipped together before, go to 
prayer together now. In that unity there is power.

Working Two By Two                                                                                                                                641
Acts
In Chapter 3 we read of the healing of a lame man. He was over 40 years 
old (4:22), lame from birth, and was brought to the Beautiful Gate of the 
temple every day to beg. He must have sat there every day for the previ-
ous 20 years at least. Jesus would have seen him frequently. And Jesus 
would have given him money each time – not healing. Why didn’t Jesus 
heal  him?  Because  He  had  no  leading  from  His  Father  to  do  so.  Some 
people imagine that Jesus went around healing everybody. He didn’t. He 
went to the pool of Bethesda where multitudes of sick people lay and He 
healed only one lame man. He never healed this man at the Temple gate 
even though He saw him frequently. If Jesus had healed him, the revival 
that  broke  out  in  Acts  3  and  4  through  this  man’s  healing,  would  not  
have taken place. We can hinder God’s work if we act according to our 
own reason without seeking the will of God in prayer. This is why Jesus 
told  Martha  that  the  most  important  thing  was  not  to  do  some  service  
for Him but to listen to Him first (like Mary did) and then to do what He 
tells us to do. The Father’s time for that man to be healed was after the 
day of Pentecost through Peter. That teaches us a lesson. Even if we have 
a spiritual gift, we must exercise it only as God leads us to – and not as 
we think best. Otherwise, we will hinder God’s purposes. But who under-
stands this nowadays?
Most believers are not in touch with the Holy Spirit. They live by rules 
such  as,  “Everybody  can  be  healed  supernaturally”,  or  “Nobody  can  be  
healed  supernaturally”  –  depending  on  whether  you  are  Pentecostal  or  
anti-Pentecostal. Jesus however did not live by rules but by the leading 
of the Holy Spirit. Those who live by rules are legalists, and can never 
fulfil the will of God. Jesus was in touch with the Holy Spirit – and the 
Holy Spirit never gave Him the liberty in His spirit to heal this man. So, 
every time Jesus passed him by, he gave him only money. Thus Jesus 
fulfilled the will of God. Later on when Peter came by and the man asked 
Peter for money, Peter said, “I don’t have money to give you, but in the 
Name of Jesus stand up.” The result was that 5000 people were saved. 
5000 people were born again, because Jesus obeyed the Holy Spirit for 
3½ years, and did not heal this man.
This is a big warning to me – how I can hinder God’s work if I “lean on 
my own understanding” (Proverbs 3:5), if I act without a leading from the 
Holy Spirit. It may be a good work that I am doing (what could be better 
than healing a lame man??), but it could hinder God’s plans. God’s ways 
are not our ways. The clever man, the man who lives by rules, will be a 
hindrance to God’s purposes. Many Christians who live by upright prin-
ciples and rules are the biggest hindrance to God’s work. The man who is 
most useful to God is the one who listens to the Holy Spirit.
In 4:8, we see that Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit a second time. 
And then in 4:31, we see him filled a third time. So between Acts 2 and 
Acts 4, Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit three times. This teaches us 
that the fullness of the Holy Spirit is something we need to experience 

642 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
again and again and again. We have to keep on being filled. Yesterday’s 
fullness  is  not  good  enough  for  today.  Many  who  claim  to  have  been  
baptised in the Holy Spirit in the ancient past are dry as a desert today. 
All they can do now is quote a date many years ago when they were filled. 
But God wants rivers of living water to flow through us always.
In 4:28, we again find the expression that we saw in 2:23, “to do what-
ever Thy hand and Thy purpose predetermined to occur.” When they were 
beaten by the religious authorities, they said, “Lord, this also is accord-
ing to Your predestined plan.”
In 4:32,  we  see  that  “the  congregation  of  those  who  believed  were  of  
one  heart  and  one  soul.”  The  secret  of  the  power  of  the  early  church  
was not only the fullness of the Holy Spirit, but also the fact that they 
were of one heart and one soul. They submitted to the apostles and they 
were  completely  united.  They  were  not  critical  of  everything  like  many  
Christians today. “And they did not claim that anything belonging to them 
was their own.” This does not necessarily mean that they sold all their 
property. But they did not say that anything they had could be used only 
by them – it was available for other believers in the Body who needed it. 
Nobody  was  in  need,  because  those  who  had  much  helped  those  who  
had less.
The Sin of Ananias and Sapphira
In  a  situation  like  that,  one  can  imagine  how  some  people  would  take  
advantage  of  it.  In  Chapter  5,  we  see  that  Ananias  and  Sapphira  tried  
that.  Many  people  want  to  join  our  churches  in  India,  because  they  
see  many  hospitable,  generous  people  in  our  midst.  But  if  we  are  not  
careful to weed out such people immediately, very soon every poor person 
in  India  will  want  to  join  our  churches,  and  we  will  have  remarkable  
“church-growth”!! We will get “converts” who are interested in money, not 
in righteousness. In the old days, they talked about ‘rice Christians’, who 
came to the missionaries primarily to get free food, free education, free 
medical treatment, and possibly a free trip to the United States as well. 
That  attitude  is  still  there  today.  For  many  Christian  workers  in  India  
today, “serving the Lord” is a profession and not a calling. Many people 
have prospered financially by joining the church. If their prosperity came 
because God honoured them for being righteous in their life, that is all 
right. But if their prosperity has come because of the wealthy contacts 
they  got  by  joining  the  church,  then  they  have  missed  the  will  of  God  
completely – because Christianity is not a way of making financial profit. 
The church is a place to sacrifice and give – not a place for profit and 
gain. It is a sad fact that many “Christian workers” in India today earn 
five to ten times what they would have earned if they had been in a 
secular job. Many “Christian workers” have never worked a single day in 
a secular job. Jesus never called anyone to be His apostles who were not 

The Sin of Ananias and Sapphira                                                                                                            643
Acts
already working in a secular job. Christian work has become a source of 
immense profit for many in India today. Non-Christians look at them and 
say, “This person has become a Christian worker to make money.” And 
they  are  right!  How  shall  we  shut  their  mouths?  Only  when  Christian  
workers can show that they could have made more money in a secular 
job than what they get in Christian work.
At  a  time  when  everyone  was  selling  their  property  and  giving  it  to  
the  apostles  to  distribute  to  the  poor,  Ananias  and  Sapphira  thought,  
“How can we appear spiritual while still keeping our money?” So when 
they sold their land, they did not give all of their money. Their sin was 
not that they did not give all their money. God loves cheerful givers and 
doesn’t  want  anyone’s  money.  Peter  said  to  Ananias,  “When  your  land  
was not sold, it was yours to do what you liked with it. And even after it 
was sold, the money was yours. But why do you tell a lie” (5:4). Ananias’ 
sin was hypocrisy – pretending to be wholehearted. If he had said, “We 
sold that land for 50,000 rupees. But we feel we should give only 20% 
of that. We want to keep the rest for our own needs. So here is 10,000 
rupees.” Peter would have blessed Ananias – and he and his wife would 
have remained alive. Ananias never said anything. He told a lie without 
opening his mouth, by just standing in the line with all the other whole-
hearted people. But Peter was a man of discernment. Both Ananias and 
Sapphira were exposed by him and they died for their hypocrisy.
Why doesn’t God act like that today? Because very few will be left alive 
in the churches then! Ananias and Sapphira were in the midst of a very 
pure and powerful church – and that is why they died. If they had been 
in some dead, carnal church (like the one in Corinth), they might even 
have been elders there. It is dangerous to join a church that is pressing 
on to perfection, if you are proud and a hypocrite. God will smite you and 
remove you from their midst, in one way or the other. But there are not 
many churches like that nowadays. So you will survive in most churches 
today.  If  you  want  to  remain  alive  and  be  proud  and  a  hypocrite,  then  
choose a dead church to join.
In 5:29, we read these bold words that the apostles spoke to the reli-
gious leaders, “We must obey God rather than men.” In 5:41, we see that 
when they were persecuted and imprisoned and beaten, “they rejoiced that 
they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for Jesus’ Name.” Their 
persecutors had the apostles whipped and flogged. The apostles didn’t go 
away after this, with their heads hanging down. They lifted up their heads 
and said, “Praise the Lord, we got flogged for Jesus’ sake.” They consid-
ered it a great honour. It was as if they had been given a gallantry award 
by a king. As Jesus had told them to do, they “leaped for joy”.
These apostles have set us a good example to follow. We will have a 
lot of persecution in India in the days to come.  So  let  us  be  ready  
for those days and get others ready too. And when it comes, let us also 
rejoice that we are counted worthy to suffer shame for Jesus’ Name.

644 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
In Chapter  6  we  read  about  the  disciples  increasing  in  number  and  
complaints beginning. This has been the problem in all churches, when 
they grow in size. When a church starts, it is small, and one can be fairly 
certain that everyone is a disciple. But when it becomes large, murmur-
ing, grumbling and complaining start very easily, because many of the 
newcomers  are  relatives  of  the  original  disciples  –  and  they  may  not  
be  disciples  themselves.  But  then  something  must  be  done  about  this  
problem to prevent it from spreading. It’s like someone in a group getting 
a highly infectious disease. If you don’t isolate that person, it will spread 
to  others.  Most  complaints  in  churches  are  related  to  earthly  things.  
The complaint here was about food. The Greek widows complained that 
the  Jews  were  favouring  their  own  widows  in  the  distribution  of  food.  
It was a problem on communal lines, just as it is in many churches in 
India today.
The apostles were wise. They said, “We can’t go into the food- distribution 
business,  because  that  is  not  our  calling.  We  will  devote  ourselves  to  
prayer and to the ministry of the Word” (6:4). If you are called and gifted 
by God to preach the Word of God, don’t ever backslide from that calling 
to become the director of some Christian social service organisation that 
offers you a good salary. Stick to being a teacher/prophet. Let others 
fulfil the other ministries. So the apostles selected seven men full of the 
Holy Spirit and appointed them for this task. Stephen and Philip were 
among them, but they became great preachers too. Stephen became the 
first martyr and Philip went to Samaria and brought a great revival there 
and  became  God’s  channel  to  send  the  gospel  to  Ethiopia  by  bringing  
the Ethiopian finance minister to the Lord (Acts  8).  Like  Elisha,  who  
started  by  serving  Elijah  and  later  became  a  prophet,  these  two  men  
also  faithfully  served  the  widows  –  and  later,  God  gave  them  a  wide  
preaching ministry.
Stephen – Full of God’s Grace and Power
It is written about Stephen that when he preached to the Jewish religious 
leaders, they could not refute the wisdom and the spirit with which he 
spoke (6:10). That can be our experience too, when we speak. Stephen 
went on to ask them, “Which of the prophets did your fathers not perse-
cute?” (7:52). Every single prophet in Old Testament times was unpopular 
and  persecuted.  A  prophet  is  different  from  a  teacher.  A  teacher  may  
be accepted by many, but a prophet is usually rejected and unpopular. 
A  teacher is a non-controversial figure. A true prophet however is always 
controversial. So prophets are always persecuted, but not teachers and 
evangelists. Stephen preached in such a way that they were convicted. 
This made them so angry that they killed him. He was the first martyr in 
the Christian church (7:54, 55).

Stephen – Full of God’s Grace and Power                                                                                            645
Acts
In the words written about Stephen in 7:55–60, we see some marks of 
a truly Spirit-filled prophet: 
1. His mind is steadfastly set on heavenly things.
2. He sees the glory of God in all situations.
3. He is unruffled by the opposition of men.
4. His vision is fixed on Jesus at the right hand of God.
5. He testifies boldly about this Risen Christ.
6. He is persecuted and at times killed.
7. He forgives his persecutors and prays for them.
God  allowed  Stephen  to  be  killed  for  many  reasons  –  one  of  which  
was the conversion of Saul of Tarsus. I wonder if Paul would have been 
converted if he had not seen Stephen’s attitude when he was being killed. 
When the Roman centurion heard the way Jesus prayed for those who 
crucified Him, he was convinced that Jesus was the Son of God. When 
Paul heard the way Stephen prayed, his conscience began to prick him 
and  he  began  to  think,  “This  cannot  be  a  false  religion.  Maybe  I  am  
wrong.” Later, on the Damascus road, the Lord told him, “It is hard for 
you to keep on kicking against the pricks of your conscience” (Acts 26:14) 
– and he was converted.
The way you react to people who do evil to you could trigger a reaction 
in someone watching you that could result in his salvation. Paul was just 
the first of many thousands who have been converted in the past 2000 
years  by  seeing  the  godly  reaction  of  Christians  to  persecution.  But  to  
react like that, we must be filled with the Holy Spirit.
In Chapter 8, we read of a great revival in Samaria that came through 
the preaching of Philip – a man who had started his ministry by serving 
food  to  poor  widows.  Many  were  saved  and  Philip  baptised  them.  But  
he  could  not  lead  them  into  the  baptism  in  the  Spirit  –  just  like  many  
preachers today. So Peter and John came and prayed for them and they 
received the Holy Spirit (8:17).
We see the phrase “baptized in the name of Jesus” occurring four times 
in Acts  (2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5).  But Jesus  commanded  His  apostles  
to  “baptize  in  the  name  of  the  Father,  and  the  Son  and  the  Holy  Spirit” 
(Matthew 28:19). How do we explain this apparent difference? Many who 
read the Scriptures carelessly are puzzled by it. Here are three principles 
to be borne in mind when interpreting the New Testament:
1. When two Scriptures appear to contradict each other, both are true – 
the contradiction is only apparent.
2. Whenever  in  doubt  as  to  which  of  two  apparently  contradictory  
passages of Scripture to obey, always obey the clear command of the 
Lord Jesus.
3. Never make a historical passage of the New Testament a basis for any 
doctrine.

646 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
The explanation in this case is this: Non-Christian religions also had a 
trinity – for example, Hinduism had Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva; and the 
Egyptians had their trinity too. So when the apostles baptised, in order to 
identify the Trinity as the Christian trinity, they baptised “in the name of 
the Father, the Son the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit”. This was 
called  “baptism  in  the  Name  of  Jesus” because it identified the Second 
Person as Jesus Christ.
When  Simon  the  magician  in  Samaria  saw  people  receiving  the  Holy  
Spirit through Peter laying hands on them, he offered Peter money for this 
power. Here we have the first example in the Christian age of someone 
trying  to  buy  God’s  blessing  with  money.  Non-Christian    religions  have  
always encouraged people to give money to their god to get his blessings. 
Unfortunately nowadays, many Christian TV preachers and pastors are 
also preaching that you can get God’s blessings by giving money to God 
–  through  His  servants;  and  millions  of  Christians  are  being  deceived. 
But you can never get God’s blessings that way. Peter refused to receive 
such  money  –  unlike  most  of  today’s  preachers.  He  told  Simon,  “Your 
money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God 
with money. Your heart is not right with God” (8:20, 21). Many rich people 
try  to  bribe  preachers  today  by  giving  them  money  for  their  ministry.  
If  we  sense  that  a  man’s  heart  is  not  right,  we  must  refuse  to  receive  
his  money.  But  where  are  the  preachers  like  Peter  today?  Most  minis-
tries and preachers love money so much that they receive money from 
anyone and everyone. Some of them go from house to house with receipt 
books collecting money “for God’s work” from even unconverted nominal 
Christians. Neither Jesus nor the apostles ever did that (3 John 7).
Saul’s Conversion
In Chapter 9, when Saul met the Lord on the Damascus road, he asked 
the Lord two questions: “Who are You, Lord? What will You have me to 
do?” (verse 5 - KJV). These were two questions that he kept on asking the 
Lord all through his life. At the end of his life he says that his passion is 
to “know Christ more” and to “press toward the mark to fulfil the will of 
God” (Philippians 3:10, 13). The Lord did not show him the whole plan for 
his life initially. He showed him step by step. “Go into the city and I will 
tell you what to do” – was the first step (verse 6). 
There  was  a  man  called  Ananias  in  Damascus  who  was  sensitive  to  
the Holy Spirit, and who heard the Lord tell him to go to the place where 
Saul was staying and pray for him. When the Lord tells you to go some-
where, you can be certain that He has prepared people at the other end 
to receive your ministry. If, however, you go on your own, you may go to 
places where no-one is ready. Ananias was a humble, unknown brother 
whom God used to pray for Saul to be filled with the Holy Spirit so that 
Saul  could  become  the  mightiest  apostle  in  the  first  century.  All  the

Acts
disciples those days realised that it was not enough to be converted, but 
one had to be filled with the Holy Spirit too.
In 9:25,  we  read  how  Paul  had  to  be  lowered  in  a  basket  through  a  
window to escape being killed. In 2 Corinthians 11:32, 33, Paul related 
this humiliating incident to the Corinthians to show how God humbled 
him. In Acts 8, we saw how God lifted Philip up and transported him to 
another place. God could have easily done that for Paul here too, when 
the  people  were  trying  to  kill  him.  But  God’s  ways  are  not  the  same  
always. At times, we have to go through humiliating ways to escape from 
our enemies. But He saves us one way or the other.
Cornelius – A Non-Jew Who Feared God
In Chapter  10,  we  read  of  the  gospel  going  to  non-Jews  for  the  first 
time. The Lord had told His disciples that they would be His witnesses 
in  Jerusalem,  Judea,  Samaria  and  then  to  the  ends  of  the  earth.  In  
Chapter  2,  they  started  with  the  Jews  in  Jerusalem  and  Judea.  Then  
in Chapter  8,  they  went  to  the  Samaritans.  And  now  it  was  moving  to  
non-Jews for the first time. Peter was given the privilege to open the 
doors to the Jews and also to the non-Jews.
Cornelius was a man who knew nothing of the Bible or of God. But he 
was a devout man who prayed to God continually and helped the poor 
generously (10:2). An angel appeared to him and told him that both his 
prayers and his alms had been accepted by God (verse 4). So we see that 
God listens to the prayers of non-Christians too, if they are God-fearing 
and  sincere,  and  He  leads  them  to  Christ  Who  is  the  only  way  to  the  
Father (John 14:6). Many Christians, like Peter, imagine themselves to be 
superior to non-Christians. But some non-Christians, like Cornelius, are 
more God-fearing than many Christians. Peter also felt that he was purer 
than  non-Jews.  But  God  had  to  change  Peter’s  opinion  and  to  enlarge  
his heart. And God may have to change our opinions about non-Chris-
tians  too.  Peter  was  so  stubborn  in  his  opinion  that  God  had  to  give  
him a vision to change his opinion (verse 11). In this vision, Peter saw a 
sheet containing clean and unclean animals and he heard a voice asking 
him  to  kill  them  and  eat  them.  Peter  refused  to  do  so  saying  he  had  
never  eaten  anything  unclean  –  because  certain  animals  were  unclean  
according to the law of Moses and Jews were forbidden from eating them 
(Leviticus 11). But God told him not to call anything unclean that God 
had cleansed. This vision was repeated three times. Peter was perplexed 
as  to  the  meaning  of  this  vision  when  the  messengers  from  Cornelius  
reached Peter’s house with the message that an angel had told Cornelius 
to send for Peter. Then Peter understood that God was telling him to go 
to the house of this non-Jewish man whom the Jews considered unclean.
The angel who came to Cornelius certainly knew the facts of the gospel 
– that Christ died for the sins of the world and rose again from the dead. 

648 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
Why didn’t he then preach the gospel himself instead of asking Cornelius 
to call for Peter to come and preach the same message to him? What was 
it that Peter had that the angel did not have? I am sure the angel could 
have explained the gospel ten times better than Peter. But Peter had the 
experience of salvation which the angel did not have. Only a sinner saved 
by grace can tell another sinner about salvation. That is what we saw in 
the very first verse of Acts: Jesus did and then taught. If you don’t have 
an experience you should not speak about it. Even the angel respected 
that Divine principle. So never preach what you know but only what you 
have practiced or at least seeking to practice.
When Peter came to Cornelius’ house, he said, “Now I understand that 
in every nation the man who fears God and does what is right is welcome 
to Him” (10:35). (And not only in every nation, but in every denomina-
tion too). God welcomes those who fear Him, in every religion and leads 
them  to  Christ  so  that  they  can  be  saved.  What  if  Peter  had  refused  
to  go  to  Cornelius’  house?  Would  Cornelius  have  been  lost  if  Peter  
disobeyed? That would be very unrighteous of God to make Cornelius 
suffer for Peter’s disobedience. If Peter had not gone, God would have 
sent James or John or someone else to him. If Ananias had not gone 
to Saul of Tarsus, God would have sent someone else. If you don’t go 
where God tells you to go, God will give your ministry to someone else.
In 10:38,  Peter  describes  Jesus’  ministry  thus:  “Jesus  of  Nazareth  –  
God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and He went about 
doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was 
with Him.” Even in Jesus’ life, it was power that was the evidence of the 
anointing  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  And  with  that  power,  Jesus  did  good  and  
delivered people from Satan’s oppressions. God fills us with the Spirit so 
that we too can do good to others and deliver them from Satan’s oppres-
sion. We are surrounded by people who are oppressed by Satan – people 
who  are  discouraged,  unhappily  married,  harassed  by  their  marriage-  
partners,  neglected  by  their  parents,  and  some  even  contemplating  
suicide. God has placed us in the midst of such people so that we can 
help them to be free from sin and from Satan – and thus happy. If even 
Jesus needed to be anointed by the Holy Spirit to fulfil this ministry, how 
much more we! We read that when Jesus was anointed, “God was with 
Him.” And when we are anointed with the Holy Spirit, God will be with 
us too. When we stand in the pulpit to preach God’s word or when we go 
to cast out a demon from someone, God will be with us to bless people.
In 11:28, we read of a prophet Agabus prophesying that there would be 
a famine all over the world. He didn’t say exactly when it would happen, 
because Jesus said that “the times and epochs are in the Father’s hand” 
(Acts 1:7). But it did take place soon thereafter.

Old Covenant and New Covenant Prophets                                                                                         649

Old Covenant and New Covenant Prophets
There is a difference between old-covenant prophecy and new-covenant 
prophecy.  Under  the  old  covenant,  people  would  ask  the  prophets  for  
guidance  as  to  what  to  do  and  the  prophet  would  direct  them  telling  
them what God had told him to tell them. This was because the people 
did  not  have  the  Holy  Spirit  to  guide  them.  Only  the  prophet  had  the  
Holy Spirit. But under the new covenant the Lord says, “They shall not 
teach every man his neighbour, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ but all shall know 
Me”  (Hebrews  8:11).  Now  that  the  Holy  Spirit  can  dwell  within  every-
one, there is no need for any prophet to give directive prophecy to any 
child of God, telling him what to do. If he does that, the prophet would 
be taking the place of the Holy Spirit and connecting people to himself 
and not to Christ. The Bible says that the Holy Spirit Who dwells in us 
jealously desires us (James 4:5). What for? He jealously desires that we 
should have a direct connection with our Bridegroom and that no man 
should come between us and Christ. There are many pastors and self- 
appointed “prophets” nowadays who tell people what to do, where 
to go, whom to marry, etc. All such people are actually hindering 
the work of the Holy Spirit, for they give people the impression that 
God will not speak to them directly. Such prophets are (knowingly 
or unknowingly) inspired by Satan, for they come between people 
and  the  Lord.  Always  remember  that  the  Holy  Spirit  jealously  desires  
that  you  be  connected  to  Christ  so  intimately,  that  no-one  can  come  
between you and Him.
Many people have asked me to find the will of God for them in some 
area. I dare not do that because I reverence God. Only one who does not 
reverence God will dare to take the place of the Holy Spirit in the life of 
another. I am always ready to give people advice concerning the actions 
they  are  considering.  I  can  tell  them  the  advantages  and  dangers  of  a  
particular course of action. But then I will tell them to pray and I assure 
them that God Himself will tell them through the Holy Spirit, what they 
should do.
So don’t ever try to find out God’s will for somebody else and thus take 
the place of God in their lives. It says about the Antichrist that he will sit 
“in the temple of God displaying himself as being God” (2 Thessalonians 
2:4). There are false prophets today who have this spirit of the antichrist 
who  are  sitting  in  the  church  (God’s  temple),  taking  the  place  of  God  
– and telling people what God’s will for their lives is. Yet another proof 
that these self-appointed “prophets” are false prophets is that almost all 
of  them  expect  money  from  people  after  they  have  prophesied  to  them  
– exactly like a doctor who collects his consultation fees!! Those who go 
to such prophets never grow in the Lord because they lose their direct 
connection with the Holy Spirit. The next time they want to know God’s 
will, they will have to go to the prophet again. The Holy Spirit wants to 
show you the will of God Himself – and not through someone else.

Acts
What did Agabus, a true prophet, do here? He said that there would be 
a famine. He did not say that therefore they should take an offering for 
the poor saints and send it to them. No. Because He knew that in the new 
covenant, no-one is supposed to tell another child of God what he should 
do.  He  knew  where  to  stop,  unlike  the  false  prophets.  A  true  prophet  
will  speak  forth  what  God  has  revealed  to  him  about  the  future  –  and 
then stop. The believers in Antioch then sought God and the Holy Spirit 
Himself told them what to do. They collected some money and sent it to 
the poor saints. Directive prophecy is an Old Testament feature because 
people didn’t have the Holy Spirit in those days. It is never found in the 
New Testament.
All collection of money that we read of in the New Testament – whether 
here, or in 1 Corinthians 16:2, or in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 – was always 
and only for  the  poor  saints  in  the  churches.  We  never  read  of  Paul  
or  any  apostle  asking  anyone  to  take  a  collection  for  themselves  or  
for  their  ministry.  They  only  recommended  that  the  poor  should  be  
helped. Paul worked to support himself and trusted the Lord to provide 
his  extra  needs  through  the  Lord  Himself  prompting  people  to  send  
money  for  his  needs  –  and  not  by  his  advertising  his  needs  to  them  
himself or by sending reports of his work to the saints.
The collection from Antioch was sent to Jerusalem through Barnabas 
and Saul (Acts 11:29, 30). There was a huge wall of separation between 
the Jews and the Gentiles. But God used a famine to bring the Gentiles 
in  Antioch  closer  to  the  Jews  in  Jerusalem.  Some  of  the  troubles  and  
trials  that  God  sends  into  our  lives  and  our  churches  are  designed  by  
Him to bring us closer to each other. When a believer is sick in a hospital, 
the other believers may provide food for his family and pay for his hospi-
tal expenses. Thus when the sick person comes out of hospital, he will be 
more closely linked to the body of Christ. So we can give thanks even for 
sicknesses that God permits.
In Chapter  12,  we  read  that  James  was  killed  by  Herod.  Herod  then  
imprisoned Peter as well. But the church prayed fervently for his release 
and  he  was  miraculously  released  (12:5–16).  God  could  have  delivered  
James as easily as He delivered Peter. But when a man’s time on earth 
is  over  in  God’s  diary,  God  just  takes  him  home  to  heaven.  In  the  Old  
Testament,  we  read  that  the  prophets  Uriah  and  Jeremiah  displeased  
King Jehoiakim with their prophecies. But Uriah was killed by the king 
and Jeremiah escaped (Jeremiah 26:11, 20–24). Here James was killed 
but Peter escaped. Do you ever wonder why God didn’t answer your prayer 
like He did for someone else? When Peter testified at that prayer-meeting, 
James’s mother would have wondered why God didn’t deliver her son as 
well. If she were a godly woman, she would have recognised the sover-
eignty  of  God  and  rejoiced  with  Peter’s  family  members  at  his  release.

Acts
At times, we see one brother healed and another dying of the same sick-
ness. We can only humble ourselves in such situations and accept God’s 
sovereignty. We cannot explain them.
First Missionary Outreach
In Chapter  13, we read about the first great missionary movement out 
of  Antioch.  Barnabas  and  Saul  who  had  gone  to  Jerusalem  with  the  
money  from  Antioch  had  seen  the  amazing  release  of  Peter  and  were  
challenged. They had gone to Jerusalem to bless the people materially, 
but  got  a  spiritual  blessing  in  return,  by  seeing  what  prayer  could  do.  
“He who waters others will be watered himself” (Proverbs 11:25). When 
they  returned  to  Antioch,  they  taught  the  elders  there  what  they  had  
learnt  about  prayer  (13:1,  2).  And  they  all  decided  to  fast  and  worship 
God.  They  were  worshipping  God,  asking  for  nothing.  It’s  wonderful  to 
fast  and  just  worship.  God  spoke  to  them  saying,  “Set  apart  Barnabas  
and Saul for the work to which I have (already) called them” (13:2). It is 
not mentioned here how God spoke to them. It must have been by a deep 
conviction in their spirits that this was what God was saying.
This  was  not  the  time  that  God  called  Saul  and  Barnabas.  He  had  
already called them earlier. Whenever God calls anyone, it will always be 
personally and privately. It may be confirmed in public later, as here. But 
don’t ever think God is speaking, when somebody says, “Thus says the 
Lord, ‘Go there’, or ‘Marry this person’ ”, etc. You must throw such words 
into the trash-can, where they belong. If God wants you to do something 
He will speak to you privately. He may confirm it through other elders 
publicly.  But  it  will  always  be  to  do  something  that  God  had  already  
told  you  earlier.  Saul  and  Barnabas  had  already  heard  the  call.  They  
were thinking about it, when, in a prayer-meeting, the elders heard God 
saying, “Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have 
(already)  called  them.”  Saul  and  Barnabas  had  patiently  waited  until  
their fellow-elders also heard God – and then they went out, sent forth 
by their fellow-elders. This is how ministry in the Body is under the new 
covenant – unlike under the old covenant where prophets went forth on 
their own, wherever they felt God was sending them.
The Lord called me to full-time Christian work on 6 May 1964. I was 
working in the Indian Navy and was on vacation, having meetings along 
with  an  evangelistic  team.  As  I  was  reading  the  Scriptures,  God  called  
me very clearly from Isaiah 49. But no-one sitting near me heard what 
God had spoken to me. It was a private and personal call. About an hour 
later, as I was meditating on God’s call and considering resigning from 
the Navy, a man of God who was traveling with us (and whom I respected 
more than anyone else in India) came to me and asked me, “When are 
you thinking of leaving the Navy?” It was a prophetic word that amazed 
me. But it was an external confirmation of what God had already told 

652 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
me inwardly. If God calls you He will call you personally first. A confirma-
tion will come to you then from other godly men. But you must hear the 
call yourself first. This is the way we see it in the New Testament.
In 13:36, we read that “David served his own generation in the will of 
God and then fell asleep”. We are all called to serve our own generation by 
doing the will of God. So make sure that you fulfil all of God’s will before 
you leave this earth. To do that, you must be a man like David, about 
whom God could say, “I have found David, a man after My own heart who 
will fulfil all My will” (verse 22).
Churches Planted and Elders Appointed
In Chapter 14, we read how the Lord healed a lame man through Paul. 
It is interesting to see the fickleness of the crowds there in Lystra. One 
moment they were ready to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods, but very 
soon  they  wanted  to  kill  them  (verses  13  and  19).  In  the  synagogue  in  
Nazareth, Jesus also experienced something similar. Initially, the people 
there  said,  “What  gracious  words  He  is  speaking!”  But  a  few  moments  
later they wanted to kill Him (Luke 4:22 and 28, 29). But they couldn’t 
kill Jesus and they couldn’t kill Paul – because God’s time for them had 
not come.
They  stoned  Paul  and  dragged  him  outside  the  city,  supposing  him  
to be dead. Does God allow His greatest servants to be treated like this 
by others? He does – even today. He did not stop evil people from killing 
Jesus (when His time came). And God did not stop evil people from killing 
the early apostles. As far as we know, only John out of the original twelve 
apostles, died a natural death. Judas committed suicide. The other ten 
were all martyred. Paul was beheaded. Some of the greatest servants of 
Jesus Christ in history have been killed – and God did not stop evil men 
from killing them.
In 2 Corinthians 12, Paul speaks of an experience that he had 14 years 
earlier of being taken up to the third heaven and coming back to earth. 
That  may  have  happened  at  this  time  when  he  was  stoned  in  Lystra.  
While his body was lying on the ground outside Lystra, God may have 
taken him up for a short trip to the third heaven!! You can be certain that 
if  God  allows  you  to  face  intense  suffering,  He  will  also  give  you  some  
precious rewards to compensate for that suffering.
In 14:21, we read that Paul went back to Lystra to preach. He was not 
afraid to go back to the city where he had been stoned. He strengthened 
the disciples there by telling them (from his own experience now), that 
“we  can  enter  God’s  kingdom  only  through  tribulation”  (verse  22).  Paul  
had the spiritual authority to make such a statement, for he stood there 
with the scars and wounds of tribulation on his body.
In 14:23, we see Paul and Barnabas appointing elders in every church 
they planted. You never see “pastors” being appointed in any church in 

Balance of Grace and Truth                                                                                                                     653
Acts
the  New  Testament.  The  word  ‘pastor’  is  found  only  once  in  the  Bible  
(in Ephesians  4:11)  –  and  it  has  been  mistranslated  there.  The  Greek  
word translated as “pastor” (‘poimen’) there has been translated as “shep-
herd”  in  all  the  other  22  places  where  it  occurs  in  the  New  Testament  
–  and  it  should  have  been  translated  as  “shepherd”  in  Ephesians  4:11 
too.  Shepherds  are  gifts  the  Lord  gives  to  the  church  just  as  He  gives  
apostles, prophets, evangelists and teachers to the church. But none of 
these are offices. ‘Elder’ however is an office of leadership in the church. 
And there was always more than one elder appointed in every church.
Under the old covenant, God called lone individuals to be the leaders 
of His people – for example, Moses, Joshua and David. But once Jesus 
came, He started sending out His disciples two by two. Under the new 
covenant, the Holy Spirit called Paul along with Barnabas. God’s will is 
that a minimum of two brothers lead every local church. Only then can 
the Body of Christ be expressed. Jesus spoke once about the worldwide 
church (Matthew 16:18) and only once about the local church (Matthew 
18:17). And in the context of the leadership of the local church, He said 
that  He  would  be  present  in  the  midst,  when  a  minimum  of  two  were 
present  (Matthew  18:20).  A  minimum  of  two  elders  (who  are  one  with  
each  other)  are  required  to  bind  Satan’s  activities  in  a  local  church  
(Matthew 18:18, 19). Two elders also are able to give a balanced leader-
ship to a church.
In Chapter 15, we read of a controversy about circumcision. The apos-
tles very wisely came together to discuss the matter. Remember this was 
at  a  time  when  there  was  no  written  New  Testament.  Such  controver-
sies are unnecessary today because we have the written New Testament 
with us. In those days, they were in a transition period between the two 
covenants.
Balance of Grace and Truth
In 15:36,  Paul  suggests  to  Barnabas  that  they  visit  the  new  churches  
again and establish the believers in them. There is something profitable 
for us to learn here. The apostle Paul probably had a greater burden for 
reaching the unconverted than any man who ever lived. He was always 
seeking  to  preach  the  gospel  where  Christ  was  not  even  heard  of.  Yet  
here we read that he wanted to go back to the believers in the different 
churches and establish them. There were still thousands of places where 
the gospel had not yet been preached. But Paul knew that it was impor-
tant to build the babes in Christ together into one Body. Unfortunately, 
many neglect this in our day.
Barnabas  then  suggested  that  they  take  John  Mark  also  along  with  
them. John Mark had gone with them on their first journey, but had 
dropped out, finding missionary work difficult. Paul refused to give Mark 
a second chance, but Barnabas wanted to. After all, Mark was Barnabas’ 

654 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
cousin (Colossians 4:10)! The disagreement between Paul and Barnabas 
over this issue was so sharp that they separated from each other (15:39). 
The Holy Spirit had called Paul and Barnabas together for a special task. 
Paul was a strict man, majoring on truth. Barnabas was a gentle person 
who majored on grace. Between the two of them, the glory of God could 
have been manifested “full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). But they could 
not get along with each other. Was their separation in the will of God? No. 
God does not call people to work together just for a year or two. If they 
had  continued  to  work  together,  how  much  more  the  work  of  the  Lord  
would have progressed! At the end of his life, Paul said, “Mark is useful 
to me” (2 Timothy 4:11).
How did this affect John Mark? He was blessed by Paul’s attitude and 
by  Barnabas’  attitude.  Paul’s  strict  attitude  must  have  made  him  take  
his Christian life more seriously. At the same time, Barnabas’ gentle atti-
tude saved him from getting discouraged and giving up. It is when grace 
and truth operate together, that people are truly blessed.
We see that the apostles also made mistakes. The Acts of the Apostles 
mentions a number of the mistakes that the apostles made. That is why 
we  should  never  establish  any  doctrine  from  the  book  of  Acts. But  the  
apostles learned from their mistakes. If this disagreement between Paul 
and  Barnabas  had  occurred  when  they  were  60  years  old,  they  would  
have  found  a  solution  without  separating.  But  they  were  in  their  30s  
then – full of zeal, but with very little wisdom.
The failures of the apostles, however, encourage us, because all of us 
have made many mistakes. God turned their mistakes for the further-
ance of the gospel. Now instead of one team going forth, two teams went 
forth. And both teams had one experienced person in it. Barnabas took 
Mark and Paul took Silas. So the gospel spread even further. God uses 
the things that the devil does, for the furtherance of the gospel. Praise 
the Lord! He can do the same with our mistakes too.
In 16:1,  2,  we  read  of  Paul  meeting  Timothy.  It  was  Paul  who  had  
chosen Silas to be his co-worker. But God had someone else in mind for 
Paul  –  Timothy.  When  Barnabas  left  Paul,  God  saw  that  Paul  needed  
another gentle person to replace him. And so He gave him Timothy, an 
outstanding young disciple whose temperament was very similar to that 
of Barnabas. Then we see another mistake that Paul made: He circum-
cised Timothy in order to please the Jews. Later, Paul got light on this 
and said that circumcision was unnecessary (Galatians 5:2, 3). But the 
apostles were in a transition period between the old and new covenants 
and it took time for them to get clear light.
In 16:9,  we  see  an  example  of  how  the  early  Christians  understood  
spiritual leadership. Paul was the leader of the team and he alone saw 
the  vision  of  a  man  inviting  him  to  “come  to  Macedonia”.  In  the  next  

Led By the Holy Spirit                                                                                                                               655
Acts
verse (16:10), we read, “When Paul saw the vision, all of us sought to go to 
Macedonia.” The rest of the team had such confidence in Paul’s leader-
ship that they said, “Paul, if you have seen the vision, that’s enough for 
us. All of us don’t need to get visions ourselves. We are convinced that God 
has called us to go to Macedonia.” It’s wonderful when a team has such 
a godly leader.
There are many Christian workers who work all by themselves without 
any  fellowship  or  leadership.  They  choose  that,  because  it  is  easier  on  
their flesh! They can then do what they like, without consulting anyone. 
But ultimately they will destroy themselves. If you are young, you need 
a God-appointed leader to guide you. Those who reject godly leadership 
are on dangerous ground.
Led By the Holy Spirit
In 16:6, we read. “They passed through the Galatian region and were not 
permitted  by  the  Holy  Spirit  to  speak  in  the  Asian  region.”  How  did  the  
Holy Spirit stop them in Galatia? Paul explains in Galatians 4:13, “You 
know that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to 
you the first time”. Paul was planning to go to Asia Minor. But he fell sick 
while in Galatia, and so could not leave the place. While he was there, 
he preached to people in that area. Some were converted and churches 
were planted there. So God permitted Paul to be sick so as to stop him in 
a certain place where there were people to be saved. So don’t ever think 
that you will miss the will of God if you fall sick.
In 16:17  we  read  of  a  demon-possessed  girl  following  Paul  and  Silas  
around and saying, “These are the servants of the Most High God.” Paul 
ignored her for a few days and then commanded the demon to come 
out of her. Paul didn’t want a testimony from any demon. Jesus also 
refused to receive testimony from any demon.
In 17:10, 11 we read that Paul and Silas went to Berea. The Bereans 
are called noble-minded, because they received the word of God eagerly 
and then studied the Scriptures daily to check whether what they had 
heard was Scriptural or not. Since they checked every preacher’s doctrine 
with the Scriptures, they were never in danger of being deceived by any 
preacher  preaching  false  doctrines.  And  that  is  why  Paul  never  had  to  
write a letter to the Bereans correcting false doctrine, as he had to write 
to some of the other churches! 
In 18:9, 10, we read that the Lord told Paul while he was in Corinth, 
“Don’t be afraid of the opposition. Go on preaching boldly because I have 
many  people  in  this  city.”  We  don’t  have  to  run  away  from  somewhere,  
just  because  there  is  opposition  to  the  gospel  there.  If  we  face  perse-
cution,  however,  the  Lord  has  commanded  us  saying,  “Whenever  they  

656 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
persecute you in one city, flee to the next” (Matthew 10:23). But it is good 
to seek the Lord even then, before we flee. If the Lord tells us to leave, 
then we must leave. But the Lord may at times tell us to stay on, as he 
told Saul. It’s good to listen to God and not to go by the witness of exter-
nal circumstances alone.
In 18:24–28,  we  read  of  a  godly  sister,  Priscilla  and  her  husband  
Aquila, helping Apollos (a zealous brother) to get a clearer understand-
ing of the gospel. Priscilla appears to have known the truth of the gospel 
more clearly than her husband – because her name comes ahead of her 
husband’s in four out of the five places in the New Testament where 
their names appear together (18:26). She knew that in the new covenant, 
sisters could prophesy (Acts 2:17; 1 Corinthians 11:5). At the same time, 
she  knew  her  place  as  a  sister  and  didn’t  try  to  share  the  truth  with  
Apollos  all  by  herself.  She  called  Apollos  home  and  sat  down  with  her  
husband and they explained the gospel to him. As a result, Apollos went 
on  to  become  a  mighty  preacher  of  the  truth.  Sisters  can  have  a  great  
ministry in this new-covenant age.
In 19:2, Paul asks a question of some disciples in Ephesus: “Did you 
receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” Paul’s question here clearly 
teaches us that:
1. It is possible to receive the Holy Spirit at the same time as one believes 
in Christ,
2. It is possible to believe in Jesus and yet not receive the Holy Spirit. 
That means one is not really born-again.
3. We can know with certainty whether we have received the Holy Spirit 
or not.
They replied saying that they had not even heard about the Holy Spirit. 
Then  He  asked  them,  “Into  what  then  were  you  baptized?”  This  shows  
that  Christians  in  those  days  were  baptised  not  in  the  name  of  Jesus  
alone but “in the Name of the Father, the Son Jesus Christ and the Holy 
Spirit”. That was why Paul expected them to have heard about the Holy 
Spirit when they were baptised. They then told him that they had been 
baptised into John’s baptism. Then Paul baptised them in the name of 
the  Father,  the  Son  Jesus  Christ  and  the  Holy  Spirit.  Then  Paul  laid  
hands on them and the Holy Spirit came upon them and they spoke in 
unknown languages and prophesied.
Notice the different operations of the Holy Spirit in Acts. In Chapter 2, 
the 120 were praying and the Holy Spirit fell on them. In Chapter 8, the 
Samaritans received the Spirit when Peter and John laid hands on them. 
In Chapter 9, Paul received the Spirit when Ananias laid hands on him. 
In Chapter 10, Cornelius received the Spirit even before he was baptised 
in water, while listening to a message, without anyone laying hands on 
him. Here in Chapter 19, they received the Spirit through the laying on 

Paul’s Imprisonment                                                                                                                                657
Acts
of  hands.  This  teaches  us  that  the  Holy  Spirit  can  be  received  with  or  
without the laying on of hands, and before or after water baptism. The 
method is not the main thing but the reality.
In 20:17–35, Paul warns the elders in Ephesus after having been with 
them for 3 years. There are a number of things we can learn here about 
how  we  should  serve  the  Lord.  First  of  all,  Paul  preached  “repentance 
and  faith”  (20:21).  He  did  not  leave  out  the  message  of  repentance  as  
most  preachers  do  today.  And  when  he  is  about  to  leave  the  elders  he  
does not highlight the various themes of his sermons to them, but points 
them to the humble and simple life of service that he lived among them 
(20:18, 19). He could boldly say, “Look at my life and follow me as I follow 
Christ”. Our life must speak to those we have lived with, more than our 
words. Then he warned them to watch their own lives first and then 
to watch over their flock (20:28).  He  warned  them  that  wolves  would  
come into the church once he had left (20:29). Why didn’t those wolves 
come in when Paul was there? Because Paul was a very strict gatekeeper. 
Every  church  needs  at  least  one  elder  who  is  a  strict  gatekeeper  who  
uses his rod to protect the sheep from the wolves (Psalm 23:4). If on the 
other hand, the elders seek to get a reputation for gentleness, then the 
church cannot be kept pure, for the wolves in sheep’s clothing will take 
over and the church will be destroyed. Paul also told them how he had 
supported  himself  and  his  co-workers  all  those  three  years  and  never  
been a burden to anyone (20:33–35). Those elders, however, did not give 
heed to Paul’s warnings and so the church in Ephesus drifted away from 
the Lord (Revelation 2:1–5).
Paul’s Imprisonment
In 21:3–14, we see a contrast between carnal and spiritual “prophecy”. In 
Tyre, some Christians “prophesied” and told Paul that he should not go 
to Jerusalem. They were well-meaning believers, but they did not know 
how to stay within the boundaries of new-covenant prophecy. They spoke 
out  whatever  came  into  their  minds,  prefaced  it  with  a  “Thus  says  the  
Lord” and thought that it was prophecy. Many do that today too.
A little later, a true prophet Agabus, came and he prophesied (21:11). 
But he knew where to stop. He only said that Paul would be bound in 
Jerusalem. But he did not tell Paul whether he should go to Jerusalem or 
not. As we saw earlier in Chapter 11, in new covenant prophecy, although 
at times there may be warnings about the future, no direction will ever 
be  given  to  any  believer  as  to  what  he  should  or  should  not  do.  After  
the coming of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, all can now know the 
Father’s will themselves (Hebrews 8:11). There is not a single example of 
directive prophecy after the day of Pentecost in the Bible. Do you see the 
difference between carnal and spiritual prophesying now?

658 Through the Bible: The Birth and Outreach of the Church 
Acts
So  Paul  went  to  Jerusalem.  Did  he  go  there  in  the  will  of  God?  He  
certainly did. The Lord appeared to Paul there and told him, “Take courage, 
Paul. As you have witnessed for Me in Jerusalem, you will witness in 
Rome  also”  (Acts  23:11).  There  the  Lord  clearly  told  him  that  he  was  
in  God’s  will.  So,  if  Paul  had  listened  to  those  well-meaning  immature  
Christians  who  “prophesied”  and  told  him  not  to  go  to  Jerusalem,”  he  
would not have gone to Jerusalem or to Rome. And he would have missed 
the will of God. It was in the prison in Rome that he wrote Ephesians, 
Philippians and Colossians. We would not have got those letters, if Paul 
had listened to those self-appointed prophets in Tyre who imagined that 
the Lord was speaking through them. If you listen to people who give 
you directive prophesies, you will miss the will of God even today.
But in the same chapter (Chapter 21) where we read of Paul not listen-
ing to men but to the Holy Spirit, we also read of his making one of the 
biggest mistakes of his life as a Christian when he listened to men and 
not to the Spirit. In 21:18–26, we read how he yielded to pressure from 
James, the leader of the Jerusalem church, to follow some Jewish temple 
rituals  and  to  shave  his  head.  This  shows  us  how  the  greatest  men  of  
God can fail when they stop listening to the inner witness of the Spirit in 
their heart.
In  Paul’s  testimony  in  24:16,  we  see  one  great  secret  of  his  life:  
“I   always maintain a conscience blameless before God and before men.” 
He never allowed sin to remain on his conscience even for a moment. 
He confessed it to God and man and set it right immediately.
In 26:19, we see yet another secret of Paul’s life: “I was not disobedi-
ent to the heavenly vision.” The Lord did not give Paul a blueprint for his 
whole life when He met him on the Damascus Road. He showed Paul only 
one step at a time. And Paul obeyed – one step at a time. That is all that 
we are called to do as well.
In Chapter  27,  we  read  the  story  where  the  ship  in  which  Paul  was  
travelling to Rome as a prisoner was wrecked. Yet, no-one died. Because 
Paul was on board, God protected all those who were on that ship from 
death. Whether it be a ship, or a car, or an aircraft, or a house, or a city 
– all who are in it get blessed if one man of God is in there.
In 28:30,  31,  we  read  that  Paul  stayed  two  years  in  his  own  rented  
house in Rome. He did not ask the church in Rome to pay his rent, even 
though they would have been glad to do that. He was a man who was free 
from all men. He could not earn money making tents while in Rome. How 
then could he afford to rent a house for two years there?
Paul’s father must have been a very rich businessman, for only such 
Jews could afford to go abroad to places like Tarsus and give their sons 
the high education that Paul received. But Paul must have been disinheri-
ted by his family when he became a Christian. However, it is likely that 

Paul’s Imprisonment                                                                                                                                659
Acts
the family changed their mind later and decided to give Paul his share of 
the family inheritance. When he was arrested in Jerusalem, we read that 
his  sister’s  son  came  to  meet  him  (23:16).  This  young  man  must  have  
brought Paul the news that the family inheritance had been released for 
his  use.  This  is  probable,  because  immediately  after  this,  we  read  that  
the governor Felix hoped to get a bribe from Paul (24:26). A governor like 
Felix would obviously expect a huge amount of money as a bribe. How 
did Felix imagine that a poor preacher like Paul could pay such a large 
bribe? He must have known from the Roman commander that Paul had 
received a large sum of money recently. 
It is this money that enabled Paul to rent a house in the most expen-
sive city in the world, for two years. It is wonderful to see how God cares 
for His servants when they are old and weak, so that they are not put to 
shame. “He silently plans for us in love” (Zephaniah 3:17 - paraphrase). 
This  should  be  an  encouragement  to  all  of  us  who  are  in  the  Lord’s  
service. He will never let us down.
While Paul was a prisoner in that house with a Roman soldier guarding 
him, he preached the gospel of the kingdom of God to all who came to 
him. All the soldiers who were guarding him heard the gospel and some 
were converted too (Philippians 1:13; 4:22).
God saw that Paul had so much spiritual content in him that needed to 
be passed on to future generations. But Paul was a man who was always 
on  the  go.  How  could  God  stop  him  enough  to  make  him  put  down  in  
writing what he had learnt of God? By allowing Satan to imprison him in 
Rome. While imprisoned, Paul wrote some of his finest epistles – which 
might never have been written otherwise – epistles that have now been a 
blessing to people for 20 centuries. God’s plans are always for our very 
best. He turns the evil that Satan does for His glory.
The last word in Acts is “unhindered”. All authority in heaven and earth 
belongs to the Lord Jesus, and so the gospel has gone forth unhindered 
for 20 centuries now – and it will continue to do until Christ returns.
God has given Paul’s example to us in the Acts of the Apostles for us 
to be challenged. Paul supported himself all his life and served the Lord, 
so  that  he  would  not  be  a  burden  to  anyone.  We  see  him  as  a  unique  
example in many other areas too. Let us follow his example and serve the 
Lord in our day.



ROMANS
The Full Gospel of God
T
he theme of Romans is found in the very first verse of this letter: 
‘the gospel of God.’ This is God’s good news that He wants everyone 
in the world to hear. 
As we go through the presentation of the gospel in Romans, you will 
find that Christians stop at different points along the way and that very 
few reach the ultimate goal that God has for them. Many Christians have 
not heard the full gospel of God. There are churches that call themselves 
‘Full  Gospel  Churches.’  I  have  been  to  a  number  of  them,  but  I  haven’t  
heard the full gospel in any of them the way it is described in Romans.
Romans  is  the  most  orderly,  logical,  step-by-step  presentation  of  the  
gospel  found  anywhere  in  the  Bible.  In  Paul’s  other  letters  (except  
Ephesians)  he  gives  various  exhortations  and  teachings  all  jumbled  
together. But in Romans he goes step-by-step.
Along  this  way  you  can  stop  at  whichever  point  you  like  and  go  no  
further.  Some  who  want  only  forgiveness  of  sins  stop  at  Chapter  3. 
Others move further to justification by faith and stop at Chapter 4. Yet 
others seek for a life of peace with God and joy in tribulation, and stop at 
Chapter 5. Still others move further into a life of victory over sin, but stop 
at Chapter 6 and remain legalists. Some move further still to Chapter 7 
and become free from legalism. Many think that the gospel ends with the 
triumphant life, filled with the Holy Spirit described in Chapter  8  and  
stop there. But a very few move still further into understanding God’s full 
purpose of making them one body in Christ and reach Chapters 12 to 15 
and finally to Chapter 16 where Satan is crushed under their feet – the 
climax of the gospel. You may discover as we study this wonderful letter 
that you have stopped somewhere along this way. If you discover where 
you are stuck, you can start moving on from there to enjoy the full gospel.

Romans
Good News for Sinners
The good news in Romans is for sinners. It is not for those who imagine 
themselves to be righteous. Jesus did not come to call the righteous, but 
sinners to repentance. So the first thing that we need to see clearly is 
that we are all sinners. That is what Paul seeks to establish in the first 
2½ chapters. 
There are two types of sinners – the godless, worldly sinner (described 
in Chapter  1)  and  the  religious  sinner  who  imagines  that  he  is  holy  
(described in Chapter 2). Jesus portrayed these two types in the parable 
of the father who had two sons (Luke 15:11–32). The younger son there 
was  worldly,  wicked,  rebellious,  godless  and  immoral.  The  elder  son,  
however, thought he had done nothing wrong and that he was holy and 
righteous. It was difficult for the elder son to recognise that he was a 
sinner. It is more difficult for those who have grown up in religious homes 
to recognise that they are sinners. “It is with difficulty that the righteous 
is saved” (1 Peter 4:18). When Jesus was on earth, the prostitutes and 
thieves  experienced  salvation  easily.  But  the  “elder  brothers”  of  that  
time,  the  Pharisees,  the  self-righteous  sinners,  never  came  to  Jesus  to  
be saved. Jesus told them in Matthew 21:31, that the godless sinner was 
more likely to be saved than the religious one. In Romans 1 to 3, the Holy 
Spirit  shows  us  that  there  is  no  difference  between  these  two  types  of  
sinners in God’s eyes.
Now we can look at Chapter 1. 
We are told in 1:3 that the gospel of God concerns His Son Who was 
born “of the seed of David according to the flesh”. The humanity of Jesus 
is  stressed  right  at  the  beginning  of  Romans.  Jesus  was  born  through  
the body of Mary whose father was Eli (Luke 3:23) whose ancestry went 
back to Nathan the son of David (Luke 3:31). The body of Jesus was not 
created from nothing inside Mary’s womb. God could have done that, but 
then  Jesus  would  not  have  had  the  physical  connection  with  Adam’s  
race that was necessary for Him to redeem us. Jesus’ body was formed 
from an egg that came from Mary’s ovary. The Holy Spirit supernaturally 
created the sperm that united with Mary’s egg to form the holy body into 
which Jesus entered from heaven. The body of Jesus was born with an 
umbilical cord connected to Mary’s body that had to be cut when He was 
born. If you don’t believe that, then you don’t believe that Jesus was born 
of Mary.
We know that Jesus Christ is fully God. But if we don’t believe that He 
is also fully Man, then we will not experience the fullness of the gospel 
message. The gospel of God concerns His Son who became totally one 
with our human race. It was only thus that He could bring us salvation 
and be an Example for us to follow. The only difference between Jesus 
and us was that He was not born with a sinful nature (“old man”) like 
we are born with – because He was born of the Holy Spirit.

Good News for Sinners                                                                                                                            663
Romans
It is of great significance that Paul emphasises the humanity of Christ 
right at the beginning of his explanation of the gospel. Just before Paul 
died, he wrote one last letter to Timothy and there he said, “Consider what 
I say, and the Lord will give you understanding in all things. Remember 
Jesus Christ who was born of the seed of David and raised from the dead 
according  to  my  gospel.”  (2  Timothy  2:7,  8).  Paul  always  thought  of  the  
gospel  as  being  connected  with  Jesus  Christ  who  lived  on  earth  as  a  
Man.  When  we  see  this  wonderful  truth  that  Jesus  “became  like  us  in  
all  things”  and  “was  tempted  like  us  in  all  points  and  yet  did  not  sin” 
(Hebrews 2:17; 4:15), it will give us a totally new understanding of the 
fullness of the gospel message. The gospel in Romans is about being free 
from sin. And so Paul begins with presenting Jesus Who never sinned – 
as a Man.
He was “declared to be the Son of God by the power of the resurrection 
from the dead according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord” 
(Romans  1:4).  He  was  of  the  seed  of  David,  but  at  the  same  time  He  
was  (and  still  is)  the  Second  Person  of  the  Trinity  –  the  Son  of  God.  
God  demonstrated  to  the  world  that  Jesus  was  the  Son  of  God  by  
raising Him from the dead. He was the first human being ever to rise 
up from the dead, never to die again. All others who were raised from 
the dead before Him died again. But here was One, who was to begin 
a new race of human beings, of which we too can be a part. This is the 
gospel – that God is making a new race from out of the old human race. 
That work has already begun on the inside of many people – and will 
become manifest externally as well, one day. If we cooperate with God, 
we too can be a part of this wonderful work that God is doing in these 
last days. That is essentially what the gospel is.
In 1:5, Paul says that God has given him an “apostleship to bring about 
the  obedience  of  faith  among  all  the  Gentiles  for  His  name  sake.”  God  
calls  certain  people  to  spread  this  wonderful  gospel  across  the  world.  
The greatest ministry anyone can have is to proclaim this gospel clearly 
to our fellow human beings and to invite them to become a part of this 
new race that God is making. If you see the glory of this ministry, you 
will see what a tremendous honour it is to preach the gospel. All of us are 
called to proclaim this gospel to others. But God calls some (less than 1% 
of believers) to devote all their life and time to proclaim this gospel. God 
called me when I was 24 years old to serve Him full-time – and He could 
not have given me a greater honour on earth. Everything in the world is 
garbage  compared  to  the  calling  of  God.  And  as  time  has  gone  on,  my  
calling as a servant of Almighty God has become more and more glorious 
in my eyes. 
I have heard some full-time Christian workers boast about the sacri-
fices they have made for the Lord. Such people have not seen the glory of 

664 Through the Bible: The Full Gospel of God
Romans
their calling – and that is why they think they have sacrificed something 
for the Lord. Paul saw the greatness of his calling. And once God called 
him to be an apostle, he never felt that his giving up the opportunity to be 
a businessman in Tarsus was a sacrifice he had made. He had actually 
been promoted!
Paul  said,  “I am under obligation.... I am eager.... I am not ashamed” 
(1:14–16). What he meant by “obligation” was that once God had opened 
his  eyes  to  see  this  wonderful  gospel,  he  became  indebted  to  everyone  
in the world to tell them the good news; and he was driven by a passion 
to clear his debt. What sort of a Christian would you be if you had been 
given  money  to  distribute  to  everyone  in  your  town  and  you  kept  it  all  
yourself. Wouldn’t it be right to call you a thief? It is the same when we 
don’t share the good news of the gospel with others. What a responsibil-
ity we have to clear our debt to the people around us! We don’t need large 
evangelistic campaigns to do that. There are people whom we know and 
meet regularly. Let us clear our debt to them.
The Gospel is the Power of God
The gospel is the power of God unto salvation – not for everyone but only 
for those who believe (1:16). You can experience the power of this gospel 
only in the measure in which you believe. If you believe the gospel only 
up to Romans chapter 3, then you will experience that much. If you can 
believe up to Romans 4, then you get that much. But if you believe all the 
way to the end (Romans 16), then you will get all of the power there is in 
the gospel.
Paul said, “I am not ashamed of the gospel because in it the righteous-
ness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it says, ‘The righteous man 
shall live by faith.’ ” (1:17). ‘Faith to faith’ refers to higher and higher 
levels of faith. First of all, the faith that saves us from the guilt of sin 
and  makes  us  righteous  before  God  (Romans  3  to  5).  Then  the  faith  
that saves us from the power of sin, sanctifies us and makes us holy 
(Romans  6–8).  Then  the  faith  that  leads  us  to  consecrate  ourselves  
to  God  (Romans  12)  and  that  makes  us  part  of  the  Body  of  Christ  
with whom we fellowship (Romans 14, 15). Then the faith that finally 
crushes Satan under our feet (Romans 16). At any of these points, you 
can stop and say, “That is good enough for me.” It’s just like studying 
in a school. Some students drop out after the 4
th
 standard, some after 
the  8
th
  and  some  after  the  12
th
  standard.  But  there  are  others  who  
don’t stop even after they have got a Ph.D., but go on to post-doctoral 
studies. I wish we all had that sort of eagerness for spiritual things, 
where you are never satisfied with any depth of knowing God but want 
to know Him even more. You want to be all that God wants you to be.

Romans
I have prayed to God and said, “Father, I want to experience as much 
as  it  is  possible  for  a  human  being  to  experience  of  the  power  of  Your  
gospel, before I die. I want to experience the fellowship of Christ’s suffer-
ings to the fullest degree in my body, before I die.” Why am I eager for 
that?  Because  I  know  I  can’t  experience  any  of  these  in  heaven.  Can  
we be beaten for Christ’s sake in heaven? No. Can we be taken to court 
for Christ’s sake in heaven? No. Can we be abused and scandalised for 
Christ’s sake in heaven? No. Where can we experience the fellowship of 
Christ’s sufferings? Only here on this earth? 
Many believers are a long way from experiencing the full gospel. Most 
so-called “Full-gospel” churches are miles away from the real full gospel. 
The  gospel  is  not  just  forgiveness  of  sins  and  the  baptism  in  the  Holy  
Spirit. Those are just the kindergarten lessons. The A, B, C of the gospel 
is forgiveness of sins, water-baptism and the baptism in the Holy Spirit. 
That is the beginning of the gospel, but not the full gospel.
In Romans 1, Paul describes the guilt of the sinner. Sin begins by not 
honouring  God  and  not  giving  Him  thanks  (1:21). The first step down-
wards is when a person is unthankful to God for His goodness to him. 
When he is not grateful to God for life, health, food, etc. he has already 
started backsliding. Sin begins with unthankfulness, but it doesn’t end 
there.  It  progresses  downwards  to  slandering,  hating  God,  insolence,  
arrogance,  boastfulness,  hard-heartedness  and  many  other  things  like  
that  (1:29–31).  Thrice  it  says  here,  “God  gave  them  up”  (1:24,  26,  28). 
Just as there is growth upwards “from faith to faith”, there is also a dete-
rioration  downwards  “from evil  to  evil”.  And  God  gives  up  on  a  person  
when he refuses to listen to the convictions of his conscience. God gives 
them up to various sexual perversions, worshipping created things and 
not the Creator, etc. At its root, every sin is really a worship of created 
things instead of the worship of God.
The Guilt of the Religious Man
In Chapter 2, Paul goes on to describe the guilt of the religious man, who 
judges the sinners mentioned in Chapter 1. “You who pass judgement on 
others, do you judge yourself, because in the thing you judge other people 
you condemn yourself?” (2:1). The sins that you find in other people are 
the very sins in your heart too. This was what the Lord tried to impress 
upon  the  Pharisees,  “You  have  caught  this  woman  in  adultery.  Tell  me,  
how many of you have not committed adultery in your heart? If you have 
not committed adultery in your heart, throw a stone at this woman” (John 
8:1–11). They all went away from the Lord because not one of them could 
stand in His presence – in the presence of God’s Light.
“We know that the righteous judgment of God falls upon those who prac-
tice such things. And do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment 
upon those who practice such things and do the same yourself in secret that 

666 Through the Bible: The Full Gospel of God
Romans
you will escape the judgment of God?” (2:2, 3). That person sins openly, 
but you sin in secret. Men don’t see your sin and so they consider you to 
be a holy man, and that other person to be a sinner. But God may deal 
more mercifully with him than with you – because you have the worst sin 
of all – hypocrisy – which that other sinner doesn’t have.
Hypocrisy and spiritual pride are among the top two sins in God’s list 
–  above  murder  and  adultery.  When  you  see  that,  you  will  discover  in  
the story of the prodigal son that the elder son was the bigger sinner of 
the two sons. But the Pharisees didn’t understand that. I find that most 
Christians can’t understand it either – because they are as blind as the 
Pharisees  of  old.  They  think  that  the  godless  people  are  sinners.  What  
they  don’t  realise  is  that  God  sees  their  hypocrisy  and  their  spiritual  
pride  –  their  pretending  to  be  holy,  their  giving  others  the  impression  
that they are very prayerful and generous, when all that is not true in 
their private life. These sins are worse than murder and adultery. Have 
you seen that? Chapter 2 is for those who consider themselves to be holy 
and who look down on the adulterers and the murderers and the drug 
addicts and the drunkards.
Christian churches are filled with such people. The more separated 
they are from the dead denominational churches the bigger Pharisees 
they become. The purer their doctrine is, the more their Phariseeism, 
because  there  is  so  much  hypocrisy  in  their  lives.  They  are  defeated  
by  sin  in  their  private  lives  and  yet  they  think  they  are  better  than  
others. If you consider yourself to be a better Christian than those in 
other denominations, then your responsibility is greater to manifest a 
life that is more Christlike than that of those others. If, however, you 
find even one person in a dead denomination whose life is better than 
yours, then you should hang your head in shame and say, “Lord, don’t 
let me fool myself into imagining that my purer doctrine has made me 
a better person.”
“What shall we say then? Are we better than them? Not at all. All are 
under sin” (3:9).
Do you imagine that you sought after God? But in 3:11 we read, “There 
is  no-one  who  seeks  after  God.”  But  you  may  say,  “That  can’t  be  true  
because I did seek after God.” Then hear this: “Let God be true and every 
man a liar” (3:4). I believe what God has said here that no-one really seeks 
after Him. It is He Who seeks after us first and gives us the desire to seek 
after Him. All the knowledge of God that we have today is because of His 
mercy, and not because we sought after Him. So, none of us are better 
than or superior to any other human being. All we have is 100% due to 
God’s grace – from beginning to end. If you haven’t understood that, you 
haven’t understood the gospel at all. If a person really understands the 

The Guilt of the Religious Man                                                                                                               667
Romans
gospel  he  can  never  be  spiritually  proud.  If  you  look  down  on  another  
human being, you haven’t understood grace. Many born again believers 
have  not  understood  the  gospel  properly  –  because  they  look  down  on  
others. One who has understood the full gospel will always keep his face 
in the dust.
Many believers, even though they talk about grace, haven’t understood 
what  grace  really  is.  Deep  down  in  their  hearts  they  believe  they  have  
done  something  for  their  salvation.  If  you  want  to  experience  the  full  
gospel, you must first acknowledge this: “Lord, I am not righteous. I don’t 
understand anything of spiritual truth. I have never sought after You on my 
own. I have turned aside from Your way and become useless. I have never 
done any good in my life. My throat is an open grave. My mouth is full of 
cursing  and  bitterness.  I  do  not  know  the  pathway  of  peace”  (3:10–18).  
These  facts  are  true  of  godless  sinners  (like  the  prodigal  son  –  Luke 
15:11–24) and equally true of religious sinners (like the older son – Luke 
15:25–32). As a result every mouth has to be shut before God, because 
everyone is guilty (3:19).
For many years, I have laboured to convince believers of what they are 
very slow to accept: That they are all filthy, good-for-nothing sinners. 
I  know  from  my  own  experience,  that  this  understanding  is  the  very  
first step to experiencing a full salvation. Otherwise, we will all become 
self-righteous  Pharisees.  I  have  met  so  many  believers  whose  spiritual  
growth has been stunted just because they have not seen the filth and 
corruption of their flesh – the human nature that they inherited from 
Adam.  So  this  is  how  Paul  lays  the  foundation  for  the  gospel  (in  these  
first three chapters of Romans).
Paul  had  to  emphasise  this  truth  in  these  3  chapters.  I  have  found  
in my ministry that I too have to emphasise this truth again and again 
to believers. It is the clear understanding of this truth that will produce 
humility and Christ-likeness in our lives. 
Paul was one of the holiest men on earth in his time. He had lived with 
a good conscience before God all his life (Acts 23:1) and was blameless 
according to the standard of the law (Philippians 3:6). But yet he saw 
himself as “the chief of sinners” (1 Timothy 1:15). This was because He 
had seen the holiness of God. If we live before God’s face, there will be 
many times in our lives too, when we feel exactly like that. We cannot 
bear to see ourselves like that all the time – because we would become 
discouraged. But occasionally, God gives godly men a glimpse of His 
glory and His holiness that makes them feel that they are the filthiest, 
the most selfish, and the proudest of all the sinners on the face of the 
earth. If you have never felt like that even once, I would seriously ques-
tion  whether  you  have  known  God  at  all.  You  may  have  known  only  
Christian doctrine and not God Himself.

It  is  much  easier  to  lead  “a  prodigal  son”  to  understand  this  truth  
than  “the  elder  son”  –  just  like  it  is  much  easier  to  build  a  new  house  
on  an  empty  plot  of  ground  than  on  a  plot  where  one  has  to  demolish  
an old building first. One who has no righteousness of his own to glory 
in, is like an empty plot of ground. But one who has come from a godly 
home and who has lived a good life before his conversion, has so much 
of pride in his own righteousness to be demolished, before the Lord can 
build anything worthwhile in his life. This was why the worst of sinners 
flocked to Jesus when he was on earth, whereas the Pharisees kept away 
from  Him.  With  self-righteous  people,  we  have  to  use  a  bulldozer  and  
dynamite to blow up their pride – and that can take a long time. Many 
believers resist this work of demolition, and therefore much of their old 
building remains – and they have spiritual problems all their lives.
I want to say to all of you who have lived a good life: Allow God to do 
a thorough work of demolition in you, destroying all your pride in your 
religiosity, if you want to experience the fullness of the gospel message. 
I  am not suggesting that you go out and commit sin. No, not at all. All you 
have got to do is come into God’s presence. 
Isaiah was perhaps the holiest man on earth in his time. But when he 
saw the glory of God, he saw himself as one of the filthiest men on earth 
(Isaiah 6:5). John was perhaps the holiest man on earth towards the end 
of the first century. But when he saw the Lord in His glory, He fell at 
His feet as a dead man. Many believers never experience the full glory of 
salvation, because they don’t apply the first three chapters of Romans to 
themselves. They imagine that it has a message only for unbelievers. But 
this is the essential foundation for the message of the gospel.
When you read Romans 1, you feel that you are not as bad as those 
people described there. That’s exactly how the elder son felt about himself 
in comparison with his sinful younger brother in the parable of the prodi-
gal son. And that’s why he could not sit at the father’s right hand. And 
that’s why the anointing, freshness and power of the Spirit are absent in 
your life. Why are you so dry? Because you have not allowed the Spirit of 
God to demolish your own righteousness. You haven’t seen that all your 
goodness is like filthy rags in God’s sight (Isaiah 64:6). You will remain 
dry and empty all your life until you allow God to do a thorough work of 
demolition in you, such that you never again look down on a believer in 
another denomination, or another human being. Even after hearing this 
truth for 40 years in our churches, I find that there are some believers 
who still haven’t come to this place! So you see how difficult it is for God 
to demolish human righteousness in a person.
The Clearest Definition of Sin
The final conclusion is in 3:23:  “All  have  sinned  and  come  short  of  the  
glory  of  God.”  Godless  sinners  and  religious  sinners  are  both  equally 
guilty. Neither is better or worse than the other.

The Clearest Definition of Sin                                                                                                                 669
Romans
What is the clearest definition of sin? 1  John  3:4  says,  “Sin  is  trans-
gression of the law.” This refers to sins of commission. James 4:17 says, 
“One who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin”. 
This refers to sins of omission. But the clearest definition of sin is here in 
Romans 3:23: Sin is “coming short of God’s glory”. Sin is not just breaking 
the  ten  commandments,  nor  even  coming  short  of  the  standard  Jesus  
laid down in the sermon on the mount (Matthew 5 to 7). It is more than 
these. It is coming short of the glory of God.
What  is  the  glory  of  God?  “The Word became flesh, and we saw His 
glory...full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). The glory of God was seen in 
the life of Jesus Christ. So when we put these two verse together (John 
1:14 and Romans 3:23), we see that sin is anything unlike Christ. Who 
then can say that he is totally free from sin? No-one. Because none of us 
have become totally like Christ. 
It is those who lower their definition of sin who imagine that they are 
totally free from sin. Pass-marks in God’s kingdom is not 40% but 100%. 
Anything  less  than  total  likeness  to  Christ  is  sin.  Many  believers  feel  
that  they  were  not  as  bad  sinners  as  some  others.  But  that  would  be  
like a student who got 2% in an examination considering himself better 
than another student who got 1%. But both of them failed! Even if you 
managed to get 99% in God’s kingdom, you would be in the same class 
as  the  one  who  got  zero.  “The  person  who  keeps  every  law  of  God  but  
makes one little slip is just as guilty as the person who has broken every 
law there is” (James 2:10 - Living).
Having  known  thousands  of  Christians  in  my  life,  I  have  come  to  
the conclusion that the fundamental problem with the vast majority of 
them is that they have never seen themselves as filthy, good-for- nothing 
sinners in God’s eyes. They will acknowledge that they are sinners but 
not  as  bad  as  some  others.  This  hinders  them  from  enjoying  the  full  
power of the Holy Spirit for a full salvation in their lives. 
Many people avoid sin, fearing the punishment they will get. But when 
God  sees  someone  sin,  He  thinks  of  the  glory  he  is  missing.  There  is  a  
glory  that  you  will  miss  throughout  eternity  if  you  tolerate  any  sin  in  
your life. The measure in which you tolerate sin in your life will be the 
measure of the glory that you will miss.
How does God make us righteous? We cannot make ourselves right-
eous. So God justifies us freely (3:24). Our sins are forgiven freely through 
the blood of Christ (3:25). We are justified freely. The Holy Spirit is given 
to us freely. And God writes His laws upon our heart and mind freely too 
(Hebrews 8:10). Yet many believers who have received everything freely 
from  God  act  often  as  though  they  earned  these  gifts  by  their  faithful-
ness. Why is this so? Because they haven’t understood the second part 
of the gospel.
The first  part  of  the  gospel  is  to  recognise  that  you  are  a  good-for-  
nothing,  filthy,  useless  sinner,  no  better  than  any  other  sinner  in 

670 Through the Bible: The Full Gospel of God
Romans
the world. The second part of the gospel is to recognise that everything 
we receive from God is a free gift. What have you got today that is not a 
gift? Your intelligence is a gift from God, your health is His gift. And this 
is much more true of the spiritual gifts God has given you. Those who 
boast that they have received the baptism in the Holy Spirit (instead of 
being humbly grateful for it) will never experience the fullness of life in 
Christ – for God opposes the proud (1 Peter 5:5).
These are two foundational principles that Paul lays down. If you have 
never heard the gospel like this, ask God to open your eyes to make the 
reality of this hit you. Say to the Lord, “Lord, I am not better than anybody 
else and the whole of salvation is Your free gift.”
Justification
The next thing we need to understand is justification. “Justified” means 
God  declares  us  righteous.  The  Holy  Spirit  has  devoted  the  whole  of  
Chapter 4 to this subject. Let me use an illustration to explain justifica-
tion.  Word  processing  programs  on  computers  have  a  command  called  
‘Justify.’ When we type anything, each line will naturally be of a different 
length. While the left edge of the typed matter is in a straight line, the 
right  edge  will  always  be  jagged.  Now,  if  we  highlight  the  typed  matter  
and  click  the  command  ‘Justify’,  the  right  edge  immediately  becomes  
straight. That is called ‘justifying’. And that is a good illustration of justi-
fication. Our lives are full of jagged edges caused by sin. Every line we 
wrote  with  our  lives  from  the  day  we  were  born  ended  with  a  jagged  
edge. When we accept Christ, God highlights our whole life and declares 
‘Justified’. Immediately the jagged edge lines up and becomes straight. It 
doesn’t matter if you have written ten lines or ten thousand lines. They 
are all justified. It doesn’t matter if you are ten years old or fifty years 
old. You are justified. When you look at your life now, you cannot believe 
that once upon a time it was all jagged. What a wonderful thing it is to 
be justified! It is “just as if I’d” never sinned. That’s how God looks at us, 
when we are in Christ. Our sins are all blotted out and we are accepted 
by God just as Jesus Himself is accepted.
Justification  is by  faith.  Hence  Paul  uses  the  example  of  Abraham  
being justified in Chapter 4. How did Abraham get a son? Did he deserve 
it? Was it because he struggled? No. He had sought for so many years 
to have a son and he could not have one. He finally got a son as a sheer 
gift from God. Justification is exactly like that – it is a free gift from God. 
“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God” (5:1). 
Once we see ourselves clearly as justified, we will live in a wonderful new 
world – at peace with God. And further, “we have an introduction by faith 
into  this  grace  in  which  we  stand  and  rejoice  in  the  hope  of  the  glory  of  
God”  (5:2).  This  glory  of  God  which  we  had  missed  at  one  time  (3:23), 
is  going  to  be  a  part  of  us  increasingly.  This  cannot  make  us  proud,  
because it’s all a gift.

Justification                                                                                                                                                671
Romans
Let me illustrate this. Suppose I were to bring a cake in here, baked by 
an excellent cook. I didn’t buy it. I was given it and asked to distribute it 
to everyone here. So I cut it and pass it around. You eat it, and you say, 
“Brother Zac, this is a fantastic cake.” I cannot even be tempted to pride 
on hearing your remarks – because I didn’t bake the cake. If I had baked 
it and you had expressed your appreciation, then I would be tempted to 
feel proud.
So,  when  someone  says  to  you,  “Brother,  you  are  such  a  humble  
brother,”  and  you  feel  proud  of  it,  then  you  must  have  manufactured  
your  humility  yourself.  If  your  humility  was  given  to  you  by  God,  you  
could not possibly be proud of it – even if people praised you for it. You 
cannot  be  proud  of  a  cake  that  you  did  not  bake.  In  the  same  way,  if  
someone appreciated your holiness and you feel proud of it, then your 
holiness must be something you manufactured yourself. If it was some-
thing that God did in you, then you cannot be proud of it. If you preach 
a sermon and people appreciate it greatly – if you produced the message, 
you would be proud of it. But if God gave it to you, then it would be a sin 
to be proud of preaching it.
Do you think the servants of Cana were proud when they served the 
new wine that Jesus had made (John 2:1–12)? They would have humbly 
acknowledged,  “We  didn’t  make  this.  We  are  just  distributing  it.”  They  
were  not  in  the  production  business,  but  in  the  distribution  business.  
Praise the Lord that that is true for us too. We are not called to be produc-
ers of anything, but humble distributors of what He has given us.
There is far more spiritual pride in us than we imagine. One reason is 
that we think that we have manufactured our virtues ourselves. 
There are two things we need to understand clearly: 
1. The depth of sin within us; and 
2. The  height  of  pride  within  us,  when  we  do  not  acknowledge  that  
everything we have is God’s free gift.
Chapter  4:21  says  about  Abraham  that  he  was  fully  convinced  and  
assured  that  what  God  had  promised  He  would  perform.  That  is  real  
faith – believing that God will do what He has promised.
A lot of teaching on faith today makes believers look inside themselves 
and to ask, “Do I have enough faith to get this from God?” And then if they 
don’t get what they want, they are told that they don’t have enough faith. 
But the more we look inside ourselves, the more we will get into bondage. 
Abraham did not look inside himself to see if he had enough faith to have 
a son. Not at all. He looked upward at God – and was convinced that God 
was able to fulfil what He had promised. Faith is always upward- looking 
–  at  God.  After  the  great  chapter  on  faith  (Hebrews  11),  we  are  told  to  
“look  unto  Jesus,  the  Author  and  Finisher  of  our  faith”  (Hebrews  12:2). 

672 Through the Bible: The Full Gospel of God
Romans
True new-covenant faith looks away from Self to Jesus, the Author of our 
faith – the Author who writes faith in our hearts.
The  object  of  our  faith  is  never  found  inside  us.  It  is  what  we  look  
at outside  us  that  determines  whether  our  faith  is  strong  or  weak. 
Consider  this:  If  you  are  asked  to  walk  across  a  river  over  a  strong  
concrete bridge, your faith will be strong to walk over it! But if you are 
asked to cross the same river over a rickety, weak bamboo bridge, you 
will have no faith at all! There you can see that your faith has nothing 
to do with what is inside you. It has to do with the quality of the bridge 
across the river. Your faith is determined by an object outside of you 
– a strong concrete bridge or a weak bamboo one. Or consider this: If 
you are asked to put your money in an unreliable bank, you will find 
that  you  don’t  have  faith  for  that.  But  you  would  have  faith  to  put  
your money in a strong bank that is supported by the government and 
that  has  been  going  strong  for  many  years.  Again,  you  can  see  that  
your faith is in an object outside you. So remember these illustrations, 
when you read the promises of God in the Bible too. Don’t ever allow 
anyone to make you look inside yourself for faith. Don’t ask, “Can I do 
this?”,  but  rather,  “Will  God  do  this  for  me?”  Abraham  believed  that  
God would do what He had promised.
The New Testament emphasises such faith. We read about going “from 
faith to faith”. Many of us have had faith that our sins can be forgiven. 
The same God who forgave our sins justifies us as well. He imputes 
the righteousness of Christ to us. It says about Abraham that his faith 
“was reckoned to him as righteousness” (verse 22). The righteousness 
of Christ is put to our account by God, apart from any works we have 
done  to  merit  it  (verse  6).  If  someone  were  to  put  a  million  rupees  
into my bank account as a gift, I can’t say I did any work for it. And 
if the one who tells me that he has put that money to my account is 
trust  worthy,  I  would  believe  him,  even  without  going  to  the  bank  to  
confirm it.
So  when  the  Lord  says,  “The  righteousness  of  Christ  is  imputed  to  
you,” we believe it. It is a great insult to God to say to Him, “I don’t believe 
You.”  If  your  father  told  you,  “I  have  put  some  money  into  your  bank  
account,” and you say, “Dad, I don’t believe you,” that would be a great 
insult to your father, if he were a thoroughly trustworthy person. This is 
why unbelief is such a serious sin in the New Testament.
We can also miss a lot that God has for us if we don’t believe His Word. 
It  says  in  Matthew  13:58  that  Jesus  could  not  do  many  mighty  works  
for  people  in  one  place,  because  of  their  unbelief.  They  needed  help  –  
and Jesus also wanted to help them. But He still could not help them, 
because they would not trust Him.

The Blessings of Justification                                                                                                                  673
Romans
The Blessings of Justification
When we come to Chapter 5, we see the blessings of justification. Many 
times here, a contrast is drawn between what we received through Adam 
and what we receive through Christ. “Through one man sin entered into 
the world” (verse 12). In the same way “through one Man, Jesus Christ, 
grace abounded to many” (verse 15). In Adam we died. In Christ we can 
be  made  alive.  We  all  inherited  something  evil  from  Adam.  We  did  not  
have to learn to be wicked when we were born. Children don’t have to be 
taught to tell lies, or to fight with others, or to be selfish. It is all there 
within  them.  The  contrast  between  Adam  and  Christ  should  teach  us  
this: That as complete and total as the inheritance was that we received 
from  Adam,  equally  complete  and  total  can  the  inheritance  be  that  we  
receive from Christ.
How did we all manifest Adam’s sinful behaviour? Was it by trying to 
imitate Adam? No. We inherited his nature. How then are we going to 
follow Jesus? Will it be by trying to imitate Him? There are many people 
in  the  world  who  try  to  imitate  Christ  who  are  not  even  Christians.  
There are Christians also who try to imitate Christ. We did not try to 
imitate Adam, and we do not have to try and imitate Christ. We partook 
of Adam’s nature and we must partake of Christ’s nature. Adam gave 
us his nature totally. And Christ will give us His nature completely too 
– in the measure in which we open ourselves to Him. The Christian life 
is a life of faith – of dependence on God. He gives us His nature – this 
is the message of the New Testament.
And here is where many people make a mistake. They think holiness 
comes through striving and attaining. There certainly is striving in the 
Christian life, and there is “putting lusts to death” in the Christian life too. 
But they are the result of partaking of God’s nature and not the means to 
have God’s nature. If we imagine that we can produce the divine nature 
we  must  be  crazy.  We  did  not  produce  Adam’s  nature,  we  inherited  it,  
without our choice. We can inherit God’s nature too – but this time we 
have to make a choice. 
In 5:10, we read, “For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to 
God through the death of His Son, much more now that we are reconciled 
to  God  we  shall  be  saved  by  His  life.”  After  we  are  reconciled  to  God,  
after our sins have all been forgiven, and after we are justified, we can 
be saved – by His life. We were saved by His death, and now we are to be 
saved by His life.
There are two salvations God offers us on this earth. One is through the 
death of Christ – and we have already seen that. But here it speaks about 
being saved  by  His  life.  What  does  this  salvation  refer  to?  By  Christ’s  
death we are saved from the penalty of sin. By His life which He imparts 
to us through the Holy Spirit we can be saved from the power of sin.

When We Come Under Grace
Thus  we  come  to  Chapter  6.  Now  that  God’s  grace  abounds  so  much,  
what  shall  we  say?  Shall  we  continue  in  sin  that  grace  may  increase?  
The gospel message is that Jesus came to save the worst of sinners and 
that salvation is a free gift that cannot be earned. Some people may then 
say, “O, in that case it doesn’t matter how we live!” There are millions of 
Christians (and even preachers) who act in that spirit, because they have 
misunderstood  grace.  That  is  why  many  of  them  fall  into  adultery  and  
covetousness  –  sins  that  even  the  Old  Testament  prophets  did  not  fall  
into. Did Elijah fall into adultery? Did John the Baptist or Elisha (who 
were all under Law) run after money? No. Yet most Christian leaders who 
claim to live under grace today, live at a much lower standard of spiritual 
life than them. Why is that? Because they have misunderstood grace.
Under  the  law,  those  Israelites  took  sin  seriously.  Under  grace,  we  
should take sin more seriously.
When we come under grace, our attitude becomes: “How shall we who 
died  to  sin  still  live  in  it?”  (verse  2).  We  were  baptised  into  His  death  
(verse  3).  Baptism  is  a  burial  (verse  4).  It  is  not  a  sprinkling,  but  a  
burial. When you bury a man you don’t sprinkle sand on him; you put 
him  right  underneath  the  ground.  In  baptism,  as  a  person  is  buried  
under the water and then raised up, he is testifying to a death to an old 
life and to a resurrection to a new one. The old man (the will to sin) has 
been crucified with Christ and is buried and gone. The new man does 
not want to sin any more. He may fall, because the lusts in the flesh 
are still there. But he doesn’t desire to sin any more.
When Jesus died on the cross, our old man was crucified with Him 
(verse  6).  How  do  we  know  that?  In  the  same  way  that  we  know  that  
Jesus took our sins on the cross. God’s word says so and we believe it. 
Then we experience it. When Christ died, He took the punishment of all 
our sins. None of us saw Him die. Yet we believe He died – and we have 
experienced  His  forgiveness.  The  same  word  of  God  also  says  that  our  
old man (the will to sin) was crucified with Christ on the cross – and we 
accept it. Just as we can’t get forgiveness of sins until we accept that our 
sins were laid on Christ upon the cross, we cannot experience the reality 
of being dead to sin, until we accept it as true. This is not something we 
have to do. God has already slain our old man on the cross.
The old man is different from the flesh. Many confuse the two. The 
lusts in the flesh can be likened to a gang of robbers that seek to get 
inside a home (the heart). The heart is our home. Inside the heart of every 
unconverted  man  lives  an  unfaithful  servant  called  ‘the  old  man’,  who  
always opens the door for the lusts of the flesh to enter and rob us of all 
purity and love, etc. What did God do? He did not kill the gang of robbers. 
He killed the unfaithful servant (the old man). That is why even after you 

When We Come Under Grace                                                                                                                675
Romans
are baptised, you are tempted just as much as you were tempted before 
– because the robbers are still alive. The lusts in your flesh haven’t died. 
But your old man has died. The servant who opens the door has been 
killed in all those who have been truly born again. If I were to ask you 
who are born again, “Do you want to sin any more?,” your answer would 
be, “No, I never want to sin again.” That is because the old man has died. 
But the robbers still come every day. In fact after we are born again, the 
robbers are even more furious and eager to enter our heart.
Why  do  believers  then  fall  into  sin?  Because  the  new  man  hasn’t  
“eaten” enough and not taken enough “exercise”, he is not strong enough 
to keep the door shut – and the robbers push their way in. If you don’t 
read God’s Word and meditate on it sufficiently and God’s Word does 
not abide in you, or if you are not filled with the Holy Spirit, you are not 
strong enough to keep those lusts of the flesh outside. But  with  God’s  
Word and the power of the Holy Spirit, you can keep those lusts of the 
flesh from ever entering your heart. It says here “Consider yourself to be 
dead – reckon yourself to be dead to sin” (verse 11). Then sin won’t have 
any more power over your life.
When God says, “Your old man was crucified with Christ,” you believe 
it and accept it. You say, “Lord, just as I accepted that Christ died for my 
sins, I now accept that my old man has been crucified on that cross and 
I have died to sin. From this day onwards, I am going to consider myself 
dead to sin and alive to Christ.” To live this way every day, we need the 
power of the Holy Spirit. And so it goes on to speak about the grace that 
the Spirit gives us: “Sin will now no longer rule you because now you are 
under grace, not under law” (verse 14).
What is the difference between law and grace? In two simple sentences, 
I would put it this way: Law means I do something for God. Grace means 
God does something for me. What a difference! When a 3-year-old boy 
tries  to  write  the  alphabet  perfectly  all  by  himself,  that’s  law.  It  will  
never be perfect. Grace is when his father holds his hand and writes 
the alphabet perfectly with no mistake or error. If, however, the child 
is stubborn and says, “No, I am not going to let you hold my hand,” 
then of course he will keep on making mistakes. In the Old Testament, 
people were under law and they did everything on their own. That is 
why they made so many mistakes – and sinned all the time, even the 
best  of  them.  Under  grace,  God  promises  to  help  us.  But  we  are  so  
proud and self-confident that we don’t allow God to hold our hand. You 
won’t make a mistake if you let your Heavenly Father hold your hand. 
Submit and yield to Him. Then sin will not reign over you any more. 
Sin (unconscious sin) will still be there in your flesh, but it won’t be 
able to rule you any more – something like a king who has been over-
thrown and made into a slave. Praise the Lord.

Three Spiritual Marriages
Chapter  7  speaks  about  the  person  who  has  a  desire  for  victory  over  
sin  and  to  live  a  holy  life  but  who  misunderstands  how  to  live  it.  The  
Holy  Spirit  uses  the  picture  of  marriage  here  (verse  4).  When  we  were  
unconverted, we were married to the old man. After conversion, instead 
of  being  married  to  Christ,  we  make  the  mistake  of  marrying  the  Law.  
Every believer makes this mistake when seeking for victory over sin. He 
first tries to get victory over sin in his own strength – this is being married 
to the Law.
In Chapters 6 and 7, we see these three spiritual “marriages” – first to 
the old man, then to the Law and finally to Christ.
The old man can be likened to a wicked husband who beats his wife, 
turns  her  into  a  prostitute  and  destroys  her  life  and  her  happiness.  
This battered wife longs to be free of this wicked husband. One day her 
husband  –  the  old  man  is  dead.  She  is  born  again!  Now  she  is  free  to  
marry again. But instead of marrying Christ she makes the mistake of 
marrying someone who looks like Christ – the Law.
The  Law  is  perfect,  and  so  it  is  easy  to  mistake  the  Law  for  Christ,  
because  it  demands  perfect  righteousness.  The  Law  is  not  like  the  old  
man. He doesn’t hammer his wife or beat her or trouble her in any way. 
But he demands perfection. You must wake up promptly at 6 o’clock in 
the morning. You must have breakfast ready on the table by 8 o’clock. It 
must not be 8:01, but exactly 8 o’clock. That is perfection. Every part of 
the house must be absolutely tidy and clean. The shoes must always be 
kept in the proper place, the clothes must be washed perfectly without 
any stain, and ironed perfectly too. The Law never asks you to do anything 
evil. But how many young sisters would like to marry a good man like 
this who demands such perfection in every area? Marrying the Law after 
being married to the old man now looks like having jumped out of the 
frying pan and into the fire. He is a good man, but he is so demanding. 
He  never  asks  for  anything  evil,  but  you  can  never  measure  up  to  his  
standards. Then you realise that you have married the wrong man.
So what can you do now? The Law – God’s Law – can never die! Here 
is a husband who is healthy and strong and who will live forever. “The 
married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive” (7:2). So the 
woman gives up all hope of ever being happy. Then God does something 
wonderful. He makes the woman die, and that breaks the marriage-vow. 
The first time it was the husband (the old man) who died. Now it is the 
wife  (you)  who  dies.  “My  brethren,  you  were  made  to  die  to  the  Law  so  
that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead” 
(7:4). Now that you have died with Christ, you are not bound to the Law 
any more. And God raises you from the dead so that you can be married 
to Christ. That is the third marriage – and it is a glorious one!
But  Christ  is  also  very  demanding.  He  is  as  perfect  as  the  Law  and  
says, “Breakfast must be on the table at exactly 8 o’clock – not at 8:01. 

Three Spiritual Marriages                                                                                                                        677
Romans
Everything must be spick and span. The house must be tidy”, etc. His 
standards are not one whit lower than the standards of the Law. In fact 
they are actually higher. The Law only said, “You shall not commit adult-
ery.”  But  Christ  says,  “You  shall  not  even  lust  after  a  woman  in  your  
heart.”
But  there  is  a  big  difference  between  Christ  and  the  Law.  Christ  
says, “Let’s make breakfast together  – you and I.” He wants us to do 
everything in partnership with Him.
Suppose  you  are  one  of  those  inefficient  wives  who  can  get  break-
fast ready only by 1 pm in the afternoon! The Lord won’t condemn you 
and reject you like the Law would. He says, “Never mind, we will work 
together and you will improve.” And so the Lord works with you and in a 
few days you manage to get the breakfast ready by 11 am in the morning. 
The Lord says, “Wonderful! We have moved from 1 pm to 11 am. We are 
going to make it to 8 am one of these days. We will press on to perfec-
tion.” If you are poor at washing clothes and the stains still remain on 
the clothes, the Lord says, “Never mind, we will work on that area too.” 
The next time you wash clothes, with His help, you find that there are 
less stains left behind. And the Lord is determined to work with you until 
there is not a single stain left on any of the washed clothes – He will work 
with you until you attain perfection.
Do you see how the Lord works with His bride? He doesn’t just give us 
commands like the Law does. He works with us – we are His co-workers. 
That’s the type of husband Jesus is.
Legalistic  Christians  however  live  by  rules  and  regulations  and  as  a  
result they live in perpetual self-condemnation and misery and bondage. 
And they make others around them miserable too, imposing their rules 
on  those  others  and  bringing  them  into  bondage  too.  God’s  children,  
however, are to live in “a glorious liberty” (Romans 8:21).
In the latter part of Chapter 7, Paul speaks of the struggle that goes on 
within us after we are born again. “I agree that the law is good, but I am not 
doing what I want to do” (verse 16). “The good that I wish, I don’t do, but 
I practice the evil that I don’t want to do” (verse 19). He is not speaking of 
deliberate sin. He is not saying that even though he doesn’t want to commit 
adultery, he still commits it. Or that even though he doesn’t want to kill 
anyone, he still kills people somehow!! He is not talking about such sins 
at all. He is taking about things that he cannot understand. “That which 
I  am  doing  I  don’t  understand”  (verse  15). This  whole  section  (7:15–25)  
is dealing with those areas in our life where we want to do things perfectly, 
but where we slip up and fall, despite our best efforts. And the areas in 
our life where we still don’t have light on the perfect will of God.
Consider,  for  example,  if  you  are  a  person  with  a  bad  temper.  One  
morning you decide, “I have lost my temper with my wife and children 

678 Through the Bible: The Full Gospel of God
Romans
every  day.  But  today  I  am  not  going  to  do  so.”  And  you  are  absolutely  
sincere. You don’t want to lose your temper. But something happens that 
suddenly  provokes  you,  and  you  lose  your  temper  again.  You  regret  it  
immediately. That was not a sin that you planned to commit. You didn’t 
want to fall at all – but you fell. That was not your old man. It was your 
new man who was not strong enough to keep the door shut against the 
lusts of the flesh. There are many good things we want to do but we find 
that we don’t do them – and we end the day with regret. We didn’t want 
to lust with our eyes, but in a moment of weakness, we slipped up. How 
can we ever be free from this wretched life (verse 24)? Is there a way? Yes, 
thanks be to God there is. Our flesh will forever want to sin, but our mind 
and our will are set to obey God alone (verse 25).
The Law of the Spirit
In Chapter 8, we read of freedom from sin in three tenses – past, present 
and future. We are freed first of all from the penalty of sin – “no condem-
nation” (verse 1). Then we are freed from the power of sin (verses 2–17). 
And finally, we will one day be freed from the very presence of sin (verses 
18–25).
In verse 2, we read of two laws. “The law of sin and of death” operates 
just like the law of gravity – always pulling us down. What frees us from 
this law is “the law of the Spirit”. The law of the Spirit unlike the law of 
Moses, is not a list of commandments, saying “Thou shalt”, “Thou shalt 
not”, etc. It is a Life – “the very Life of Christ Jesus”.
Let me give you an example. If I hold a book in my hand, it will not fall 
to the ground. But the moment I leave it, it falls. How is the book held up 
against the power of gravity? By the power of life in my body. My power 
overcomes the power of gravity and prevents the book from falling. That 
is how the Lord keeps us from falling too (Jude 24) – by imparting His 
life to us through his Holy Spirit. The law of life in Christ Jesus can keep 
us from falling by the law of sin and death – as long as we allow Him to 
hold us. That is how we can be overcomers. What credit can we get for 
not falling into sin, when the Lord is the One Who is holding us up? As 
much credit as a book can get for not falling when I am holding it up!! 
But unlike a book that has no power of choice, we have to cooperate with 
the Lord – because we have a will of our own. We can choose to jump out 
of the Lord’s hand, and then we will certainly fall. But if we submit to the 
Lord completely, He will keep us from falling. So, I am not saying that a 
believer will never fall. What I am saying is that a believer need not fall.
Chapter  8:28  says,  “God  makes  all  things  work  together  for  good  to  
those who love Him, to those who are called according to His purpose.” 
The gospel brings us to a wonderful position in Christ. We start out as 
sinners and receive the forgiveness of our sins first of all. Then God 

The Law of the Spirit                                                                                                                                679
Romans
declares  us  as  righteous  in  His  sight.  We  move  on  to  overcome  sin,  
then become free from the law and a legalistic spirit and enter into life 
in the Holy Spirit.
In Chapter  7,  the  words  “I”,  “me”,  “mine”  occur  many  times:  It  is  all  
about “me” and “my struggle” against sin. But in Chapter 8, the Holy Spirit 
is mentioned 17 times. There it is about life in the Spirit. When we come 
into this life of submission to the Holy Spirit, then our Father begins to 
work in all the circumstances of our life to make everything work for our 
eternal good. Even if other people try to harm us, God makes it work for 
our good (8:28). This is a wonderful gospel indeed! If we believe Romans 
8:28,  we  will  never  again  be  afraid  of  people  or  of  circumstances,  for  
the rest of our earthly lives. We will not live in fear that we might have 
an accident, or get cancer, or be harmed by anti-Christian fanatics, or 
anything else – because our Father is sovereign and controls everything 
and everyone. ‘All things’ means ALL things. That is why we can “always 
give thanks for ALL things” (Ephesians 5:20). If Romans 8:28 had stated 
that “God works most things for our good,” then Ephesians 5:20 would 
have read, “Give thanks for most things,” and 1 Thessalonians 5:18 would 
have read, “Give thanks for most things.” But since Romans 8:28 says, 
“God works ALL things for our good”, we can give thanks always and for 
ALL things. If we give only 90% of our life to God, then we will be able to 
give thanks only for 90% of the things that happen to us, because either 
Satan or we ourselves will be controlling the remaining 10% of our lives!
Romans  8:28  is  one  of  the  most  wonderful  promises  in  the  New  
Testament  and  it  covers  every  single  circumstance  we  can  ever  face  –  
absolutely and totally. I have personally believed it and lived in the good 
of it for many, many years now. This verse is like a water filter. If you 
pour dirty water into a water-filter, it comes out as clean water at the 
other  end.  In  the  same  way,  when  someone  tries  to  harm  us,  that  will  
work  for  our  good.  If a water filter can clean water perfectly, Almighty 
God  can  certainly  make  everything  work  for  our  good  perfectly.  If  we  
believe that, then we can live within the filter of Romans 8:28 all our lives. 
Whether people seek to do good to us or to harm us, everything will work 
for our good finally – always.
From the time I was born again in 1959 up until now, no-one has ever 
been  able  to  do  any  harm  to  me  until  today.  Many  have  attempted  to  
harm me. People have spread false stories about me and my teaching, 
and tried to trap me here and there. Many have hated me, as I have stood 
for the truth of the gospel, and even taken me to court. But none of them 
have  been  able  to  actually  harm me, because I live within the filter of 
God’s promise in Romans 8:28.
So tell the Lord, “Lord, I don’t have any ambition on earth, except to 
do Your will on earth as You Yourself lived. I do not desire to pursue 

680 Through the Bible: The Full Gospel of God
Romans
after money, or honour, or fame or comfort. I don’t want a single thing 
on  earth  for  myself.  I  only  want  to  please  You  every  day.  And  I  will  
judge myself in these matters constantly.” Then all things WILL work 
together for your good. And that “good” is mentioned in the next verse 
– Romans 8:29 – you will be made more like Jesus Himself. There is no 
greater good that Almighty God can do for you than that.
If,  however,  you  have  your  own  private  agenda,  then  the  promise  in  
Romans 8:28 is not for you. The vast majority of Christians do not live 
in the good of Romans 8:28, because they have their own plans for their 
lives and they only want God to come and bless them. 
But those who seek the will of God alone can go on to say, “If God is for 
us who can be against us?” (verse 31). Nobody can stand against those 
who have God on their side. God will freely give them all things (verse 32), 
Christ intercedes for them when they are accused (verse 34), and no-one 
can separate them from the love of Christ. What a blessed position to be 
in. Such believers are more than conquerors in all situations (verse 37).
God’s Sovereignty, Righteousness and Faithfulness
In Chapters  9  to  11,  we  read  about  God’s  dealings  with  Israel  and  the  
church. Chapter 9 deals with God’s sovereignty, Chapter 10 with God’s 
righteousness and Chapter 11 with God’s faithfulness.
These three chapters use the example of God’s dealings with Israel to 
show us how He deals with us. The main purpose is to humble us, after 
we have just read the tremendous expression of confidence and boldness 
and power in 8:31–39, which can easily puff us up.
So, we need chapters 9 to 11 to humble us, before we can move forward 
to Chapter 12.
In Chapter 9, we see that God is sovereign. This humbles us because 
we  realise  that  we  were  NOT  chosen  because  we  were  good.  We  are  
humbled also by the smallness of our intelligence that is totally unable 
to reconcile God’s sovereignty with our free will.
In Chapter 10, we see that God is righteous. This humbles us, because 
we  realise  that  we  can  never  attain  to  the  righteousness  of  God.  Yet  
now we have it BY FAITH.
In Chapter 11, we see that God is faithful. This humbles us, because 
we realise that we are kept from falling not by our own faithfulness, 
but  by  God’s  faithfulness  in  being  both  kind  and  severe  towards  us  
(11:22). He is kind to us, encouraging us, when we are discouraged and 
disheartened; and He is severe toward us, disciplining us when we are 
careless about sin. It is by both of these (by grace and by truth) that 
we are preserved.

God’s Sovereignty, Righteousness and Faithfulness                                                                           681
Romans
What then is the conclusion here? It is different from the conclusion in 
8:31–39.  There  we  were  told  of  all  the  benefits we  received  through  
the gospel. Here we are told of all the glory God would receive finally. 
“Everything is FROM him, THROUGH Him and TO Him” (11:36).
Let us look at these three chapters now. 
In Chapter 9, we read of God’s sovereign election of Israel. 
We must not misunderstand God’s election, as though it means that 
He  predestines  some  people  to  go  to  heaven  and  some  to  hell.  That  
is  a  totally  false  teaching.  God  wants  all  people  to  repent  and  to  be  
saved and to dwell with Him in heaven forever. But He will not compel 
anyone. He chooses us, based on His knowledge in advance as to who 
all  will  accept  Christ  as  their  Lord  (This  is  very  clearly  mentioned  in  
1   Peter 1:1, 2). We must bear in mind that the people of Israel were not 
chosen to populate heaven. No. Israel was chosen to fulfil a specific 
ministry on earth.
So God’s sovereign choice has nothing to do with being saved and going 
to heaven. God chooses people sovereignly for a specific ministry here on 
earth. We cannot have any ministry that we want to, in the church. God 
chose Israel for a specific ministry. Why didn’t He choose India or China? 
We can’t question God. Why does God choose one person to be an apostle 
and another to be a stay-at-home mother? We can’t question God. But 
God has a specific ministry for each of us and He determines sovereignly 
what gifts to give us.
We  saw  the  sovereignty  of  God  in  Chapter  8:28  controlling  all  our  
circumstances.  In  Chapter  9,  we  see  the  same  sovereignty  choosing  
people for particular tasks. He prepares us from our birth to accomplish 
a specific purpose for Him on earth. Even Pharaoh (9:17) was raised up 
to fulfil a purpose. Pharaoh opposed God and did not repent. Since he 
hardened his heart, God demonstrated His power through the hardening 
of Pharaoh’s heart. You can’t defeat God. If you fight with Him you will 
always lose.
In Chapter10  Paul  speaks  about  the  righteousness  of  God.  The  Jews  
did not achieve righteousness (9:31), because they sought after it in the 
wrong way – through the Law. There are Christians making that same 
mistake today. How can we have God’s righteousness? Verses 6 to 8 of 
Chapter 10 tell us. It is not something outside us. It says here the word 
of faith is in our mouth. “If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord 
and  believe  in  your  heart  that  God  raised  Him  from  the  dead,  you  shall  
be saved” (verse 9). We must confess with our mouth. But don’t confuse 
this with what many preachers are teaching today, that you can ask God 
for  anything  and  if  you  confess  with  your  mouth  that  you  have  got  it,  
then you will get it – whether healing from sickness, or a new house, or a 
new car, etc. We are told here to confess Jesus as Lord of our lives – and 

682 Through the Bible: The Full Gospel of God
Romans
that means that we don’t ask God any more for what we want but only 
for what He wants. So we confess what God has promised in His word, 
as we see in verse 17: “Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word 
of Christ.” You can ask God for what He has promised in His Word. The 
phrase “the word of Christ” here, refers especially to the New Testament. 
So  we  believe  and  confess  the  New  Testament  promises  such  as,  “Sin 
shall  not  have  dominion  over  you,”  (Romans  6:14),  and  then  they  will  
become a reality in our lives. Confess it with your mouth if you believe 
it. You may be thoroughly defeated by sin. But confess victory, just like 
Abraham confessed, “I am the father of a multitude,” even when he had 
no  son.  Keep  confessing,  “Sin  will  not  have  dominion  over  me  one  of  
these days,” until victory comes. I was defeated by sin for many years, 
but I kept confessing, “One of these days sin will not rule me any more” 
– and one day it became a reality.
Chapter 11 speaks about God’s faithfulness. We are told not to be proud 
just  because  God  has  been  good  to  us.  “Do  not  be  conceited,  but  fear,  
because if God cut off the natural branches, will He spare you?” (verses 
20, 21). We can be part of God’s tree and then be cut off. We are given this 
warning  again  and  again  in  Scripture  (See  Luke  11:35; Hebrews  3:12, 
etc.). Pride is always the cause of this cutting off. Those who remain in 
humility need never fear.
What Should Our Response Be?
Chapter  12:  In  view  of  such  a  fantastic  gospel  and  God’s  tremendous  
mercies,  what  should  our  response  be?  First  of  all,  we  must  present  
our bodies to God daily as a living sacrifice (verse 1). God doesn’t want 
our money, He wants our body. Like the Old Testament burnt offering, 
we  must  offer  our  bodies  saying,  “Lord,  here  are  my  eyes,  my  tongue,  
my  hands,  my  feet,  my  ears,  my  bodily  passions  –  I  lay  everything  on  
the altar.” Then, secondly, we must give Him our minds to be renewed 
(verse 2). This takes place as we allow our minds to be saturated with the 
word of God. Many of us have tremendous problems with dirty thoughts. 
Why?  Because  in  the  past,  we  used  our  minds  to  think  along  worldly  
lines. Now God wants to change our way of thinking, so that we begin to 
think the way He thinks. Thus our mind is gradually renewed.
The moment we are born again we don’t immediately begin to think as 
God thinks about everything. But from that moment God wants to change 
our way of thinking so that we gradually begin to look at everything the 
way  He  looks  at  them.  Have  we  started  looking  at  money  the  way  God  
looks at it? Have we started looking at women the way God looks at them 
and not as worldly men look at them? The world either despises women 
or  lusts  after  them.  God  doesn’t  do  either.  Have  we  started  looking  at  
our  enemies  the  way  Jesus  looked  at  them?  Worldly  people  hate  their  
enemies, but Jesus loved them. Our minds have to be renewed in every 

Accepting One Another in Christ’s Body                                                                                               683
Romans
area. As we read and obey God’s Word, the Holy Spirit transforms us into 
the likeness of Christ by renewing our minds.
Transformation takes place on the inside first. “Be not conformed to this 
world” (verse 2) teaches us that worldliness originates in our minds. 
Many imagine that worldliness is found in the way a person dresses. It 
doesn’t. It resides in the mind first. We may dress very simply and yet 
love money greatly. Man looks at the outward appearance, whereas God 
looks at the heart. A true disciple of Jesus seeks for God’s approval. It 
is only when we present our body and our mind to God like this that 
we can understand His perfect will for our lives (verse 2).
Paul  goes  on  in  Chapter  12  to  speak  about  the  building  of  Christ’s  
Body.  The  goal  of  the  gospel  is  not  individual  salvation  but  becoming  
a  part  of  Christ’s  Body  –  where  we  exercise  the  gifts  God  gives  us  –  
 prophecy, service, etc. It is not only in 1 Corinthians 12, but here too that 
a list of the gifts of the Holy Spirit are mentioned (verses 6–8). There is 
a gift mentioned here that hardly any Christian ever seeks for – the gift 
of generosity – the gift of giving money to the poor in the church and for 
God’s work (verse 8).
The  rest  of  Chapter  12  speaks  about  how  we  are  to  relate  to  other  
people in the Body of Christ. “Don’t be haughty in your mind but associate 
with lowly people” (verse 16). We must mingle with everyone in Christ’s 
Body, but especially with the poor – for God has chosen the poor of this 
world to be rich in faith (James 2:5). “Never take revenge on anyone for 
vengeance belongs to God (verse 19). Just like worship and glory belong 
to  God  alone,  vengeance  also  belongs  to  God  alone.  We  have  no  more  
right  to  take  vengeance  on  others  than  we  have  to  receive  worship  or  
glory from others.
Chapter  13  speaks  about  submission  to  civil  authorities.  The  gospel  
teaches us to submit to God first of all (12:1, 2); then to one another in 
the Body of Christ (12:3–21); and finally to secular authorities – because 
they are “servants of God” (13:4, 6). That is why we pay our taxes and 
obey the laws of our country.
Accepting One Another in Christ’s Body
Chapters 14 and 15 speak about accepting one another in Christ’s Body. 
As believers, we don’t all think alike in every matter. One day when Christ 
returns  and  our  minds  become  perfect,  we  will  agree  100%  on  every  
doctrine and we will recognise what true spirituality is and what soulish-
ness and worldliness are. But now we all have different opinions on these 
matters,  because  even  if  we  are  sincere  and  wholehearted,  our  minds  
have still been warped by the effects of sin. No-one has a perfectly clear 
understanding  of  anything.  We  see  everything  darkly  through  a  glass  

684 Through the Bible: The Full Gospel of God
Romans
(1 Corinthians 13:12). So when we see something different in others, we 
should  not  be  stubborn  imagining  that  we  are  right  and  others  are  all  
wrong. That is how divisions come in the Body of Christ. There are clear 
and  important  truths  in  Scripture  –  especially  concerning  the  Person  
and work of Christ. Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man and He died 
for the sins of the world and rose again and is the only way to God the 
Father. On such doctrines, we do not yield one bit. But there are other 
doctrines that are not fundamental.
Water-baptism,  though  not  essential  for  salvation  is  still  an  impor-
tant  doctrine  for  local  churches.  It  will  be  impossible  for  one  who  
believes in baptising children to work together in the same church with 
another who believes that child-baptism is un-Scriptural – for they will 
be clashing constantly. But even though we may not be able to work 
together with such brothers, we must still accept him as a brother in 
Christ, if he is born again – for God has accepted him. We can fellow-
ship together even if we can’t work together. The tragedy today is that 
many believers feel that if they cannot work with a person, they cannot 
fellowship with him either. That is where Chapters 14 and 15 come in.
Do you see a brother who is weak in the faith? Accept him. How should 
you accept him? “Just as Christ accepted you” (15:7). Did Christ accept 
you when you were perfect? No. Then why do you expect your brother to 
be perfect before you accept him? How weak and foolish we all were on 
the day we were born again. We knew nothing about God and we were 
all defeated by sin. Yet the Lord accepted us. He saw many things wrong 
in  us,  yet  He  accepted  us.  If  we  do  not  accept  others  whom  God  has  
accepted, we are proud and imagine ourselves to be more spiritual than 
God Himself! This is how cults are built – not only by wrong doctrines, 
but also by wrong attitudes towards other children of God. We should not 
make our petty rules and laws the basis for accepting other members of 
Christ’s Body.
“Why do you judge your brother?” (14:10a). That’s an outward action. 
“Why  do  you  regard  your  brother  with  contempt?”  (14:10b).  That’s  an  
inward attitude. We must avoid both. When our hearts are enlarged to 
accept all whom God has accepted, just as they are, then we come to the 
culmination of the message of the gospel. “In one accord (with others in 
Christ’s Body) and with one voice, we glorify God” (15:6).
The  last  chapter,  Chapter  16  includes  greetings  from  Paul  to  differ-
ent  believers  in  Rome.  In  the  church  in  Rome,  there  were  five  house 
churches  (verses  5–15).  They  didn’t  all  meet  together  in  one  hall  as  a  
mega-church. The church in Rome was very large, but they met in differ-
ent houses in small groups. Even though Paul had never been to Rome, 
he took an interest in knowing different people in the church there and 
greeted them.

Finally: The expression ‘the obedience of faith’ (verse 26) occurs here 
at the end of this letter just as it does at its beginning. God had given 
Paul the calling to lead people not only to faith but also to obey what they 
believed. Faith without works of obedience is a dead faith – like a lifeless 
body. Under  the  old  covenant,  the  emphasis  was  on  obedience.  Under  
the  new  covenant,  it  is  on  the  obedience  of faith.  We  obey  God  now,  
knowing that every command comes from a loving Father and is designed 
for our very best.



1 CORINTHIANS
The Local Church –  
And Its Functioning
I
n the second verse of this letter, we see its subject: “To the church of 
God which is at Corinth” (1:2).
This letter deals with the functioning of a local church in a city or a 
village. Notice these two expressions, ‘the church of God’ and ‘the city of 
Corinth.’ The spirit in the city had unfortunately gotten inside the church 
there, instead of the church influencing that city. That has happened in 
many churches today as well – where the believers have allowed the spirit 
of the world to influence them instead of their influencing the people 
around them.
Paul criticised many things among the Corinthian Christians because 
there  were  terrible  things  going  on  in  their  church.  But  in  spite  of  all  
that he was going to tell them, he still began with a note of thanksgiving. 
That’s a good example for us to follow. Even when we see many things 
wrong in a child of God, there will still be some things that we can appre-
ciate.  In  any  case,  we  should  avoid  criticising  anyone  whom  we  have  
never appreciated for anything. Many try to help others by criticism, but 
they  cannot  help  them  because  before  they  criticised  them,  they  never  
appreciated them for anything good that they saw in them.
If I write with a chalk on a blackboard, you will be able to read what I 
have written. But if I don’t have a blackboard and I have only a piece of 
chalk, then even if I were to write correct things, I will be writing in the 
air – and you won’t be able to see anything that I wrote. It is only on “the 
blackboard of appreciation”, that we can use “the chalk of criticism” in a 
helpful way.
If you have appreciated a person in the past, then when you take the 
white chalk of criticism, he can see clearly what you are writing. But if 
you have never appreciated him, then there is no blackboard for you to 

688 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
write on. Then, even if all your criticism is correct, you will be writing on 
thin air. He cannot see a thing, and he will not be helped. Most believers 
are writing on thin air, and that’s why they get nowhere. Let me show you 
a more excellent way. Love that person first and appreciate something 
good that you see in him. Then, even one word of criticism will go home 
to his heart – and he will do something about it.
Paul’s Appreciation and Instructions
Paul began like that. He said, “I thank my God always concerning you” 
(1:4). Paul thanked God for the grace of God that they had received, for 
their knowledge of the Scriptures and for their Christian testimony. He 
thanked God that they had all the gifts of the Spirit, unlike many believ-
ers who didn’t care for spiritual gifts. They were also eagerly awaiting the 
return of Christ. With all this, this church still had so many problems.
But we can learn a lesson from Paul here: Learn to appreciate people 
first. A teacher once held up a white sheet before her class. The sheet had 
a small black dot in one corner. She told her students to look carefully 
at  the  sheet  and  to  write  down  what  they  saw.  Everyone  wrote,  “I  see  
a black dot in the corner.” Then the teacher said, “None of you wrote a 
word about the white sheet. All you saw was the black dot.” That’s how 
we are. There may be so much of white in another person, and yet all that 
we see in him may be one small black dot that he has. There are many 
good things in others. Let us concentrate on seeing them first. We must 
train our eyes to look at people the way God looks at them.
After that, Paul went on to tell them about their faults. Once he had 
put up the black board of appreciation, he could write words of correc-
tion on it.
He said, “Each of you is saying, ‘I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of 
Cephas and I am of Christ.’ ” (1:12). They were divided into what we call 
“denominations”. Each had their favourite preacher. One group felt they 
were holier than all the others and said, “We belong to Christ”! Do you 
think that the people who said, “I am of Christ,” were more spiritual than 
the others? No. They were probably the proudest people in the church, 
who looked down on all the others, because they felt they alone were the 
Body of Christ (like many groups today).
We need to appreciate and value believers who are in other churches 
and who don’t belong to “our church”. Don’t imagine that because your 
church  is  non-denominational  or  inter-denominational,  that  it  is  more  
spiritual  than  the  denominational  churches.  Some  who  belong  to  non- 
denominational  churches  are  among  the  most  arrogant  and  conceited  
people I have met. And some from denominational churches are among 
the humblest I have met.
Paul goes on to ask, “Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified 
for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?” (1:13). Paul 

The Word of the Cross                                                                                                                             689
1 Corinthians
even  avoided  baptising  people  so  that  no-one  would  boast  that  he  was  
baptised by Paul (1:16). In 1:17 Paul begins on a theme that goes right 
through 1 Corinthians – the word of the cross. What is the solution for a 
carnal church like Corinth that has so many problems? The word of the 
cross. “The word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but 
to us who are being saved it is the power of God.” (1:18).
The Word of the Cross
What  is  the  word  of  the  cross?  It  is  the  way  that  Jesus  walked  –  the  
way of recognising one’s weakness, being misunderstood and rejected by 
others, humbling ourselves, not retaliating, and not seeking any glory or 
honour from man. Paul speaks about this in 2 Corinthians 13:3, 4 also. 
And then Paul says, “Consider this, my brothers. There are not many wise 
among you, not many noble, not many mighty.” Here is the word of the 
cross: “God has chosen the foolish people to shame the wise” (1:26–28).  
When Jesus chose His apostles, He chose unlearned fishermen to put 
to  shame  the  great  Bible-scholars  of  His  day.  Gamaliel  was  a  Bible-
seminary  professor,  and  Ananias  and  Caiaphas  were  archbishops.  But  
Jesus picked Peter, James and John, who were unlearned fisherman, to 
be His leading apostles to usher in the new covenant.
Jesus chose unlearned and uncultured people who were hard working 
and sincere and who had an open heart. He did that in order to shame 
the  clever  people  in  the  religious  society  of  His  time.  He  is  doing  the  
same  today.  Note  however  that  it  doesn’t  say  here  that  God  does  not  
choose any wise person. It says, “...not many”. God chooses a few wise 
people too. But most of His chosen ones are foolish and those whom the 
world considers as nobodies. God delights in using nobodies. If you look 
at the history of Christianity in India, you will see that most of those 
who have influenced this country for Christ were not great scholars. 
They were simple, unlearned people who were sincere. God picked them 
up,  anointed  them  with  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  used  them  mightily.  We  
must never forget that. Why does God do it thus? Because an intelligent 
man who serves God with his scholarly ability, may imagine that God is 
using him because he is so clever – and be proud of it. Rich people who 
give generously to God’s work may imagine that they are very valuable 
to  the  church  because  their  wealth  is  spreading  the  gospel.  All  such  
people  are  deceived.  God  may  use  our  intelligence  and  our  money  to  
spread the gospel – but He does not need either. He did a wonderful job 
through poor, unlearned apostles in the first century. God does things 
in such a way that no human being will ever be able to boast before Him 
(1:29).
The new song that we will sing when we stand before the Lord is, “Thou 
alone  art  worthy,  O  Lamb  of  God”  (Revelation  5:12).  Even  Paul  is  not  
worthy of any glory in heaven.

690 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
Many years ago, I was invited to speak at the graduation ceremony of 
a Bible seminary. The student who came first in the outgoing class and 
who won the most prizes, came to me afterwards and said he wanted to 
talk to me. He told me that he was thoroughly defeated by sin. All those 
years of accumulating Bible knowledge so accurately had not delivered 
him from dirty thoughts and lusting after women. He said that after four 
years of Bible-study, he was actually worse off than when he joined the 
seminary. How was all his Bible knowledge going to help him when he 
became a pastor? Was he going to teach people the root-meanings of the 
Hebrew and Greek words in the Bible? That is not people’s greatest need. 
They need to know how to overcome sin. I felt very sad for him, because 
he was a non-Christian who had come to the Lord – and he was wasting 
his life.
That is the tragedy in Christendom today. Bible-scholars armed with 
numerous degrees are teaching people theories that don’t work in daily 
life. They are leading people to the tree of knowledge that brings death, 
instead of to the tree of life.
So don’t ever be proud of your family background or your intelligence. 
Your pride will prevent God from fulfilling His purpose through you. Paul 
himself  was  from  a  very  wealthy  family  in  Tarsus.  Tarsus  was  a  town  
where Jewish businessmen went to do business – and Paul’s father must 
have been a very wealthy businessman. Paul had gone as a young man 
to  the  best  seminary  in  Jerusalem  –  where  the  scholarly  Gamaliel  was  
the  professor.  It  was  a  great  honour  to  study  under  such  a  professor.  
Paul, not only came from a wealthy family, he also had a brilliant mind. 
Paul would have been a great success in any profession. If he were living 
today,  he  could  have  been  a  top-level  computer  engineer,  or  doctor,  or  
businessman. But he did not depend on any of his abilities to serve the 
Lord. He allowed the word of the cross to crucify his confidence in his 
human qualifications.
He said to the Corinthian Christians, “When I came to you proclaiming 
to you the testimony of God, I did not come to you with superiority of speech 
or wisdom” (2:1). His preaching was not with words of human cleverness 
but in the power of the Holy Spirit, so that people’s faith would rest on 
God’s power and not on human cleverness (2:4).
Let me challenge those of you who preach the Word: Make your preach-
ing simple. In the more than 50 years that I have preached God’s Word, 
I have asked myself this question, “Can the little children who listen to 
me understand what I am saying? Or is it only the highly intelligent ones 
who understand? What about the many in India, for whom English is a 
second language, and who don’t understand big English words? Did they 
understand  me?”  If  the  little  children  can  understand  me,  then  all  the  
others will understand as well. And so I aim at the children when I speak 
– just like Jesus did. If only the clever people understand you, then you 
can be certain that 90% of the people haven’t understood you. Then what

1 Corinthians
did you achieve by your preaching? Perhaps you got some honour as a 
great Bible-scholar or as an eloquent speaker – and perhaps some money 
as well!! Do you want all that – or do you want to bless people? Make your 
choice.
When I was a young man, the Lord asked me a question, “Do you want 
to impress people or do you want to help them?” I said, “Lord, I want to help 
them.” He said, “Then stop trying to impress them!” That was a turning 
point in my life. If you want to help people, be simple in your speaking. 
God reveals His truths to those who have a heart like a little babe and not 
to those who are proud of their intelligence and their degrees (Matthew 
11:25). Jesus spoke simply. Even children could understand Him. 
And so Paul is essentially saying, “Even though I have a brilliant mind 
and  am  a  great  scholar,  and  could  have  used  all  that  to  speak  to  you,  
I  didn’t  do  that.  I  laid  everything  at  Christ’s  feet  –  all  my  ability,  my  
knowledge and my scholarship. And I decided to speak to you in a very 
simple way with the power and anointing of the Holy Spirit – so that the 
Holy Spirit could take my words home to your hearts – and not to your 
minds  alone.  That’s  what  I  want.  I  don’t  want  to  impress  you  with  my  
cleverness. I want the Holy Spirit to bring conviction into your hearts and 
to lead you into the way of abundant life in Christ.” That is the word of 
the cross.
The Corinthian Christians were babes, and so Paul had to give them 
milk (3:1, 2). When preaching to people, we have to identify their spiritual 
level first, so that we can give them whatever is appropriate for them. 
When speaking to mature, godly men, we must speak in one way, and 
when speaking to babes in Christ, we must speak in another way. The 
Corinthians  had  been  believers  for  many  years  but  they  hadn’t  grown.  
So he could not give them solid food – only milk. But when Paul met with 
more mature Christians, he could share the deeper matters of Christ with 
them  (2:6).  With  mature  Christians,  we  can  talk  about  “distinguishing 
between the soulish and the spiritual” and about “pouring out the soulish 
life to death”, etc. But with babes we can speak only about simple things 
like repentance, forgiveness of sins, overcoming condemnation and guilt 
and anger and dirty thoughts, etc. We have to give babes milk because 
they can’t tolerate strong meat that needs to be chewed! But even when 
we speak to mature people, we don’t speak using the clever ideas of this 
world, but with the wisdom of God (2:6, 7).
This wisdom of God cannot be seen by the human eye, heard by the 
human ear or even understood by the human mind. It has to be revealed 
to us by the Holy Spirit (2:9, 10). So it doesn’t make a difference whether 
you have a brilliant mind or a dull one. In past centuries, we see that God 
has often given simple people (with a low IQ) an outstanding ministry and 
built His church through them. What are the great Bible scholars doing 
in India today? They are not going into the villages and leading people to 
Christ. No. They are teaching in Bible schools, presenting papers at large 

692 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
conferences  on  evangelism  and  becoming  directors  of  large  Christian  
organizations funded from America. Who are the Christians doing God’s 
real work in India? Most of them are simple, unlearned people, filled with 
the Holy Spirit, who go out and bring people to Christ and establish them 
in local churches. That is the real work of God. So I say, let the useless 
honour-loving Christians go and present papers at conferences on evan-
gelism, and sit on international committees and become Directors. You 
who  love  the  Lord,  go  out  and  bring  people  to  the  Lord  and  build  His  
church. That’s what I want to do all my life. I don’t want to ever waste 
my time sitting on some committee or presenting a paper at some confer-
ence. I want to bring people to the Lord and establish them in churches. 
That’s what Peter and Paul and all the apostles did.
Converts or Disciples?
In Chapter 3, we read about evangelism and building the church. “Some 
of  you  say,  ‘I  am  of  Paul  and  I  am  of  Apollos’  ”  (3:4).  Paul  says,  “What 
is  the  difference?  We  are  both  servants.  I  planted  and  Apollos  watered” 
(3:6). Paul did the work of evangelism – he dug the ground and planted 
the seed. Apollos came along later and watered. He didn’t dig the ground 
or plant any seed. What was the need for that, when someone else had 
already  done  it?  He  would  have  destroyed  the  seed  if  he  dug  up  the  
ground  again!  What  the  seed  now  needed  was  watering  –  and  so  that  
was what Apollos wisely did. Some evangelists get upset if someone else 
comes  along  and  waters  what  they  have  planted.  They  will  say,  “Why  
don’t you go and plant somewhere else? Why do you come into my field?” 
But is it your field or the Lord’s field? If you are doing God’s work, then 
it is God’s field and He can send another servant to water what you have 
planted.  Paul  recognised  that.  So  he  was  happy  for  what  Apollos  was  
doing. If however you are building your own field, then it will be burnt up 
as “wood, hay and straw” one day (3:12–15).
The tragedy with much of today’s evangelism is that people say, “This 
is MY convert.” And so there is a lot of duplication of work in God’s vine-
yard  today  –  many  Christians  are  doing  the  same  thing  over  and  over  
again, instead of each person doing what God called him to do. If Paul 
plants, isn’t it good that Apollos comes along and does not plant again, 
but waters? That will make the weak plant to grow into a solid tree. That 
was the type of cooperation they had in the first century. But today, what 
we see in Christendom, unfortunately, is not cooperation, but competi-
tion. So let us learn not to duplicate another person’s work, but to work 
in cooperation, not counting any work as “OURS”!!
The great commission the Lord gave us was “to evangelize” (Mark 16:15) 
and then “to make them into disciples and teach them to do everything 
He commanded” (Matthew 28:19, 20). Consider an illustration: If you saw 
100 people carrying a log of wood, with 99 of them holding up one end 

Converts or Disciples?                                                                                                                              693
1 Corinthians
of the log and only one at the other end – at which end would you go to 
help?  Today,  in  many  lands,  99%  of  Christian  workers  are  engaged  in  
evangelism and 1% in making converts into disciples and building them 
into a local church. That was why I decided to help at the 1% – end of the 
log. I am not against those at the other end of the log. They are needed 
too. But there are already many people there.
Paul  and  Apollos  worked  together,  and  their  converts  were  for  the  
Lord and their churches were also for the Lord. Paul planted and Apollos 
watered,  but  God  was  the  one  who  gave  the  growth.  So  all  the  glory  
should go to God. Paul says about himself and Apollos, “We are nobodies. 
We are nothing” (3:7). That’s why they could work together harmoniously. 
Two  nobodies  can  work  together  easily.  It  is  when  one  of  them  thinks  
that he is a somebody, that problems arise.
If you ever build a local church anywhere, let me give you a suggestion 
from seeing the Lord plant churches in India and elsewhere for 40 years: 
Be a nobody yourself first and make all your converts into “nobody”s. Then 
you will build a wonderful church – where there is cooperation and no 
competition. A church where everyone, from leader down to the newest 
convert, is just a zero, will be the best church in the world. They may all 
be zeros, but when you put Jesus in front of them all – He being a “1” will 
make even a church with 9 people worth a billion – 1,000,000,000!! So 
determine that you will never become a somebody, but always a nobody, 
like Paul and Apollos were.
Then Paul goes on to say about laying a foundation and building on 
it. Both foundation and superstructure are equally important. Paul first 
used the illustration of growing a tree – planting and watering. Now he 
uses the picture of a building – foundation and superstructure (verses 
10–12). The foundation of the church is Christ alone – His perfect atoning 
work on the cross, with none of our works added to it. But then we must 
know how to build an eternal structure on this foundation. What sort of a 
church are you building? Is it one that is impressive in size or in quality? 
The question every Christian worker must answer is this: Shall I seek for 
quantity or quality? We can build with gold, silver and precious stones, 
or with wood, hay and straw (3:12). In the final day, it will be quality that 
matters, not quantity (3:13, 14).
With the same amount of money, you could buy a lot more of wood, 
hay  and  straw  than  of  gold,  silver  and  precious  stones.  So  if  you  are  
interested  in  building  something  huge  that  impresses  people  now,  you  
would choose wood, hay and straw. But if you knew that the fire would 
test your building as soon as it is completed, you would choose to build 
with something that can endure the fire like gold, silver and precious 
stones – even if your building would be only 1% in size compared to the 
former. We all have a limited amount of time. We don’t have thousands of 
years to live. We may have 60 years to live for the Lord after we are born 
again.  How  will  you  spend  those  60  years?  Will  you  spend  it  building  

694 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
something big, but of poor quality, that will be burnt up in the final day? 
Or will you build something that will last a testing by the severest fires – 
even if it be small?
Many believers build churches that are large in size but poor in quality. 
But  a  few  build  wisely  –  building  smaller  churches  of  good  quality  –  
preaching  repentance  and  discipleship.  The  statistics  of  the  latter  are  
not as impressive as that of the former. But one day when the Lord tests 
everything in the fire, the huge structures of wood, hay and straw will be 
burnt  up  completely  and  nothing  will  be  left.  But  the  small  structures  
built  by  those  who  spent  all  their  life  making  disciples  and  who  were  
despised by other Christians because their work was not so big, will find 
that their structure comes through the fire and endures for eternity.
So  how  are  you  going  to  spend  your  life?  Jesus  said,  “Go  and  make  
disciples  of  all  nations.”  Are  you  producing  something  that  will  last  
forever? That’s the question that must always be on our minds. Am I 
building the way God wants me to build – with the principles that Jesus 
taught? Am I making disciples who love Jesus more than anything else 
or am I just gathering converts who only say, “Lord Jesus, I believe in 
You,” but are not interested in becoming disciples? Think of the regret 
you will have when you stand before the Lord, if your entire life’s work 
will be burnt up on that day. You may be saved and go to heaven, but 
you will live in heaven with regret throughout eternity that you wasted 
the one earthly life that God gave you. I don’t want to have that regret. 
I  want  to  build  with  gold,  silver  and  precious  stones.  I  want  to  do  a  
quality-work for the Lord now.
True Servants of Christ
In Chapter 4, we read of something further about serving the Lord. “The 
most important thing about a servant is that he does just what his master 
tells him to” (4:2 - LB). That is what it means to be a faithful servant. It 
is not a question of how much you do, but whether you do only what the 
Lord tells you to do – and in the way He wants it done. For that, you have 
to wait on God and ask Him, “Lord, what do you want me to do? I want to 
do only that.” For example, if you employed a servant, you wouldn’t want 
him to run around doing whatever he felt he should do for you. No. You 
would want him to listen to you and do what you tell him to do. But most 
Christian workers do not listen to what God has said in His Word and 
follow those Divine principles. Instead they do God’s work in the way they 
feel is best – with their own bright ideas, which are usually worldly. They 
make their own programs to serve the Lord, and don’t have the patience 
to wait on the Lord to find out what His will for them is. 
In Chapter 4, Paul says that true servants of Christ (who walk the way 
of the cross) will not be honoured by the world (and that includes worldly

believers). The apostles are the greatest servants of God in His church. 
They  are  elders  to  the  elders  of  churches.  Apostles  plant  churches,  
appoint  elders  and  guide  those  elders.  But  how  does  the  world  look  at  
these  apostles?  “God  has  exhibited  us  apostles  last  of  all”  (4:9).  In  the  
world’s eyes the apostles are right at the bottom of the social ladder. They 
are “like prisoners soon to be killed... stared at by men... foolish... laughed 
at... kicked around”, etc. (4:9–11 - Living). Paul compares himself and the 
other apostles with the carnal Corinthian Christians. He says, “You all 
are filled and rich and considered wise, strong and distinguished by the 
world. We, on the other hand, are despised by the world.” A true apostle of 
Jesus Christ will not be honoured by this world. Only carnal Christians 
are honoured by the world. If you seek the world’s honour, you will most 
certainly end up as a carnal Christian.
A  true  apostle  of  Christ  will  never  become  rich  through  preaching  the  
gospel. Wherever you see a man who has become rich through preaching 
the gospel you can be sure that he is not an apostle of Christ. A person who 
has bought houses and lands for himself and his family through preach-
ing the gospel is not an apostle of Christ. A man who can buy expensive 
cars with the money he gets by preaching the gospel is not an apostle of 
Christ. He is just a carnal Christian. Paul could have made a lot of money 
through  his  gift  of  preaching;  but  he  didn’t.  A  true  servant  of  God  does  
not  make  money  through  preaching  the  gospel.  He  may  accept  gifts  in  
order to meet his earthly needs – like Jesus and the apostles did – but he 
won’t become a millionaire thus. But it is exactly the opposite that we see 
in Christendom today. And that is why my respect for all these so-called 
apostles and preachers (who may even heal the sick) is zero. I have more 
respect  for  the  Roman  Catholic  priests  who  go  to  North  India  and  live  
simply and help the poor than for these evangelical preachers who take 
tithes from poor people and become wealthy through preaching the gospel.
Who are you going to follow? Paul and Peter? Or today’s counterfeits? 
Paul goes on to say, “We are roughly treated... we toil working with our 
own  hands”  (4:11,  12). Paul supported himself financially, but yet he 
was  reviled  and  slandered.  People  told  false  stories  about  him,  but  he  
blessed them in return. He was persecuted almost everywhere he went 
and  became  “the  scum  of  the  world,  the  dregs  of  all  thing”  (4:13).  That  
means that the world considered him to be no better than the filth that 
flows in a sewage pipe. That was the way the greatest apostle of that time 
was  treated  by  the  world.  In  contrast,  the  Corinthian  Christians  were  
respected and honoured by the world – and they were happy about it.
I am sorry to say that Christendom has lost the understanding of what 
it means to be a servant of God. Our task now is to demonstrate to our 
land what it means to be a true servant of God – one who will not compro-
mise or seek for any worldly honour. God is not impressed by anyone’s 
theological degrees or other worldly qualifications. Such qualifications 
don’t scare the devil either!

696 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
Most  Christian  workers  desire  to  sit  on  thrones  and  to  get  honour.  
Don’t go that way. Be a humble servant of God all your life. Be an ordi-
nary brother and an ordinary sister, even if you are rejected by the world 
and by Babylonian Christendom as well.
Was  Paul  jealous  of  the  Corinthians  who  were  distinguished  and  
comfortable?  No.  He  felt  sorry  for  them,  because  he  was  in  a  more  
blessed position than them. He spoke as a father to them – and not to 
shame them (4:14). A true servant of God is a father. He does not shame 
people.  Teachers  may  shame  their  students,  if  the  student  does  some-
thing wrong. A good father, however, will never shame his child, even if 
he does something stupid. But the proportion of fathers to teachers in 
Christendom is about 1:10,000 (4:15).
Paul went on to say, “You all may be able to preach so many wonderful 
things. But when I come into your midst, I am not going to listen to your 
preaching. I want to see how much power there is in your life – because 
the kingdom of God is not manifested in words, but in power.” (4:19, 20).
In the first four chapters Paul laid a foundation for the word of the cross. 
Then, from Chapter 5 onwards, he begins to deal with the problems there 
were  in  the  church  at  Corinth.  The  spirit  of  the  world  in  Corinth  had  
got  into  the  local  church.  Chapter  5  is  a  valuable  portion  of  Scripture,  
because it teaches us how the apostles dealt with sin in the church.
The Spirit of the World
Paul deals here with the problem of immorality. There was a lot of immo-
rality in the heathen temples in Corinth, and that spirit had got into the 
church.  Someone  was  living  in  adultery  with  his  stepmother,  and  not  
even repentant about it. And the elders in the church were so “spineless” 
that they didn’t do anything about it. They didn’t have the moral courage 
to  put  the  man  out  of  the  church.  They  probably  wanted  a  reputation  
for gentleness. An elder can lose his reputation for gentleness if he puts 
a  man  out  of  the  church.  Others  will  criticise  him  –  and  most  elders  
do not want a reputation as being hard-hearted. Many elders love their 
reputation  more  than  they  love  the  purity  of  the  church.  Their  goal  is  
popularity, and in this respect, they are more like politicians. An elder or 
a pastor who is like that will only destroy a church.
It  is  possible  that  this  man  who  was  living  in  sin  was  a  rich  man.  
Most elders are scared to correct rich and influential members of their 
congregation – for various reasons. Such people support the church with 
large offerings. They are influential and can help you whenever you are 
in some difficulty. And so, pastors and elders usually leave such people 
alone. They discipline only the poor. But Paul couldn’t care less whether 

Glorify God in Everything                                                                                                                        697
1 Corinthians
a man was rich or poor. He handed that man over to Satan and told the 
elders to put him out of the church – to excommunicate him (5:13).
Sometimes people have to be put out of the church. Jesus said, “First 
go and speak to such a person alone” (Matthew 18:15–18). If he doesn’t 
listen to you, then take two or three others with you and speak to him. 
If he still doesn’t listen, but continues in sin, then tell the whole church 
about him. If he still continues in sin, then treat him like a non- Christian 
and  put  him  out  of  the  church.  There  is  a  need  for  discipline  in  the  
church, just like in a home. A home where children are not disciplined 
will be a chaotic home, and a church where people are not disciplined will 
be a chaotic church. In a home where the children are not discip lined, 
the children will take over the home and the father will have to sit help-
lessly in a corner. In a church where there is no discipline, the elders will 
be helpless and others will take over. That has happened in many places, 
because the elders sought popularity more than holiness.
What does it mean to “hand a person over to Satan for the destruction 
of his flesh”?  It  means  to  allow  Satan  to  attack  him  with  sickness.  All  
sickness  is  from  the  devil  –  and  I  don’t  have  the  slightest  doubt  about  
that. God is a loving Father and no loving father would give sickness to 
their children. God may permit His children to be sick at times, as He 
did with Paul. God allowed Satan to put a thorn into Paul’s flesh and did 
not  heal  him,  even  when  Paul  prayed  (2  Corinthians  12:1–7). But  that  
was for Paul’s good – to save him from pride. God doesn’t tempt anyone 
either. But He does allow Satan to tempt us. So Paul handed this unre-
pentant brother over to Satan to be made sick so that he would come to 
his senses and repent. He would be put out of the church and no believer 
would  meet  him.  And  there  in  spiritual  darkness,  even  though  he  had  
plenty of money, he would realise what he had lost and hopefully would 
repent.  God  may  allow  Satan  at  times  to  make  some  believers  sick  in  
order to make them repent. Paul, as an apostle, had Divine authority to 
deliver  people  to  Satan  like  this,  so  that  they  would  repent.  The  world  
may treat Paul like scum, but God gave him spiritual authority. Satan 
was scared of Paul.
Glorify God in Everything
In Chapter 6, Paul deals with believers who take other believers to court. 
Why  would  a  believer  want  to  take  another  believer  to  court?  Because  
he feels that the church elders cannot help him solve his problem – and 
also that Almighty God cannot help him either!! So he goes to puny men 
in a worldly court to help him. The Holy Spirit says that this is totally 
wrong – because it dishonours God, as though He is helpless to solve the 
problems of His children! There will always be problems among believers. 
But they should take it to the elders of the church and trust God to help 
them – and not go to a worldly court.

698 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
Paul goes on to say, “If your fellow-believer cheats you, why don’t you 
allow yourself to be cheated” (6:7). But instead, they were trying to correct 
one wrong by doing another wrong – taking their fellow-believers to court. 
The Holy Spirit says that those who do such things will not enter heaven. 
If you take a believer to court, you will never enter God’s kingdom (6:9). 
That  is  a  serious  sin,  because  it  disgraces  the  name  of  Jesus.  Jesus  
said, “All men will know you are My disciples when you love one another” 
(John 13:35). But you are showing unbelievers that Christians fight with 
each  other  and  thus  driving  them  towards  the  devil.  In  that  case,  God  
says, you don’t deserve to enter His kingdom yourself. A Christian must 
be  concerned  about  the  glory  of  God  and  not  about  his  own  honour.  
“Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31). Are you 
going to glorify God by taking your brother to court? No? Then don’t do it. 
Why do you take your brother to court? Because you hate him. You want 
a human judge to punish him. Why not leave it to God to punish him? 
“Don’t insist on getting even; that’s not for you to do. ‘I’ll do the judging,’ 
says God. ‘I’ll take care of it’ ” (Romans 12:19 - MSG).
Paul then speaks about three different levels at which people can live. 
“All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable” (6:12). The unlawful 
(or unrighteous) level is where most unbelievers live. No believer should 
ever  descend  to  this  level  –  but  unfortunately  some  do.  If  they  persist  
in  living  there,  they  will  lose  their  salvation.  The  minimum  level  for  a  
believer is the next level – lawful (or righteous). But there is a still higher 
level – the profitable. Out of 100 things, 70 things may be unlawful. So we 
should not do any of them. But we can do any of the remaining 30 things 
that are lawful. But out of those 30 things, only 10 may be truly profit-
able spiritually. A wholehearted Christian will do only those 10 things. 
But a halfhearted Christian will choose from any of the 30 lawful things. 
If you want to be a wholehearted, effective servant of God, then you will 
have to select the profitable things from the lawful things.
Consider the example of time. We all have 24 hours a day. If you spend 
part of that time watching dirty movies or reading dirty books, that would 
be  an  unlawful  way  of  spending  your  time.  On  the  other  hand,  there  
are many lawful ways in which you can spend your day. Some of those 
things are necessary and we have to do them. But you could spend many 
hours reading the newspaper – which though lawful may not be the most 
profitable way to spend the day. If you want to be a useful servant of God, 
you will need to be disciplined and cut out some of those unnecessary 
items from your daily routine and spend more time in the things of God. 
You can choose to spend many hours surfing the Internet (on clean sites) 
or even watching many Christian TV programs and then have very little 
time  left  to  study  the  Bible.  Or  alternatively,  you  could  spend  a  short  
while surfing the Internet (for world news, etc.) and have much more time 
to study the Bible. You are not sinning if you spend two hours watching 
a clean TV program or visiting a clean Internet site; but it may be a waste

1 Corinthians
of time that could have been spent more profitably studying God’s Word 
or helping needy people.
In the same way there are unlawful ways of spending money, lawful 
ways  and  profitable  ways.  A  wholehearted  Christian  will  use  his  time  
and his money only in profitable ways. We must learn to make the right 
choices. The secret of a godly life lies in the choices we make. Out of all 
the lawful things we can do with our time, we must choose the best way 
to spend it. Out of all the lawful ways in which we can spend our money, 
we must select the best ways. Such a man will count for God.
Then Paul goes on to speak about the way we use our body. “I will not 
be mastered by any of my bodily desires” (6:12, 13). Food is essential for 
our bodies; but if you want to be a servant of God, you must not allow 
yourself to be mastered by food. If you love food so much that you are 
mastered  by  it,  you  will  never  be  a  useful  servant  of  God.  You  have  to  
break free from that slavery. This is where fasting can help.
It  is  not  only  our  spirit,  but  our  physical  body  also  is  a  “member  of  
Christ”  (6:15).  So  we  must  never  use  it  for  any  immoral  purpose.  It  
must be for the Lord’s exclusive use – our eyes, our tongue and every 
part of our body. Here is a wonderful promise of God for the body – that 
I have claimed for myself for many years now: “The body is for the Lord, 
and the Lord is for the body” (6:13). If you say, “Lord, my body is totally 
Yours,  from  head  to  foot  –  my  eyes,  my  tongue,  my  everything,”  and  
mean it, then the Lord will be totally for your body. He will keep your 
body fit to serve Him as long as He wants you to serve Him. He will 
even preserve it from sickness. Even young people may faint, but those 
who give their bodies to the Lord him will fly like eagles in the sky.
Our body is also the temple of the Holy Spirit (6:19) – and so we must 
not defile it in any way. If you won’t smoke or drink or commit adultery 
inside a church building, then you must not do any of those things in 
your  body  either  –  because  the  real  temple  of  God  is  not  any  church  
building,  but  your  body.  “You  have  been  bought  with  a  price.  Therefore  
glorify God in your body” (verse 20).
These  nine  verses  (6:12–20)  together  form  one  of  the  most  wonder-
ful portions of Scripture about how we should use our body and God’s 
provision  for  it.  I  would  encourage  you  to  meditate  on  it,  because  we  
need a healthy body in order to serve God. Many Christians talk about 
healing. But health is better than healing. Prevention is better than cure. 
It is better to eat less and be healthy, than to be a glutton, get sick, and 
then ask God for healing. Don’t ask the Lord to be your Healer, ask Him 
to be your Health. Give your body totally to Him and say, “Lord, You are 
the Health of my body. As long as You want me to live on earth and serve 
You, I am available. I will glorify You in my body, because You purchased 
it for Yourself on the cross. My body belongs to You alone.” Our body is 

700 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
like  a  house  that  has  been  purchased  by  someone  else  –  the  Lord.  We  
must vacate this house and let the rightful Owner now occupy it fully. It 
is a sin to continue to live in a house that somebody else has purchased. 
Hand over your body then totally to the Lord.
Run Away from Immorality
There is only one way to overcome the temptation to immorality – and that 
is the way mentioned in 6:18, “Run away from it.” The Bible is realistic 
and knows how strong sexual temptation is! When Joseph was tempted 
by Potiphar’s wife, he ran away. If you don’t flee, but stand around and 
expose ourselves to temptation, then you can be sure that you will fall 
– sooner or later. If you find that a conversation, a friendship or a rela-
tionship is moving in a dangerous direction, there is only one thing you 
must do – if you don’t want to destroy your life and your ministry. Turn 
around  and  run.  Get  away  from  there.  If  you  don’t  receive  this  advice,  
you can destroy yourself – and regret throughout eternity that you didn’t 
run away. It is that serious.
In  this  context,  Paul  goes  on  to  speak  about  getting  married  as  one  
way of running away from immorality (7:2). It is true that by remaining 
unmarried,  you  can  have  more  time  to  serve  the  Lord.  But  because  
there is so much immorality in the world (and that is even more true 
today)  “let  every  man  have  his  own  wife  and  let  every  woman  have  
her own husband” (7:2). Some may say that that is a very unspiritual 
reason for getting married. But it is the Holy Spirit Who says here that 
marriage can protect you from immorality. So, don’t try to be super-
spiritual (more spiritual than the Holy Spirit)!
“If you don’t have self-control it is better to marry than to burn.” (7:9). 
It is normal for most men to burn with sexual desire when they come to 
their  late  teens  and  most  of  them  do  not  have  the  self-control  to  over-
come  it.  So  it  is  far  better  to  get  married  and  avoid  that  burning  than  
expose  oneself  to  avoidable  temptation.  The  Bible  is  very  practical.  It  
does not teach us a hermit-style of life where we have to live in a forest 
or a monastery. We are to live in the middle of the world, and be married 
like the rest of the human race. It is written of Enoch that “he walked 
with God and had sons and daughters” (Genesis 5:22). We too can live a 
normal married life and have sons and daughters, and at the same time 
walk with God like Enoch did.
Married  folk  must  recognise  that  they  lose  their  authority  over  their  
own bodies the moment they are married. I find in Indian culture that 
this is very important for women to understand. There is not enough 
teaching on this in our churches. Preachers are embarrassed to talk 

Run Away from Immorality                                                                                                                     701
1 Corinthians
about  this,  when  Scripture  speaks  about  it  so  plainly.  The  husband  
must fulfil his duty to his wife, and the wife must fulfil her duty to her 
husband (7:3, 4). The sexual relationship between a husband and his 
wife is called a duty here. It is certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It is 
as much a duty as cooking the meals, taking care of the children, and 
working to provide for the needs of the home.
Once  a  woman  gets  married,  she  does  not  have  authority  over  her  
body. Her body belongs thereafter to her husband. It was hers before 
she  was  married,  but  now  her  body  is  her  husband’s  all  the  time.  
Husbands may be delighted to hear this! But they have a responsibi-
lity too. A husband does not have authority over his body but his wife 
does. This is not referring only to the sexual relationship – husbands 
may be ready to recognise their duty in that area at all times! It also 
means that your eyes and your tongue now belong to your wife. When 
you  see  a  pretty  girl,  you  must  remember  that  your  eyes  belong  to  
your wife. When talking with other women, remember that your tongue 
belongs to your wife now. You can certainly talk with women – but not 
in a flippant or flirtatious way.
There  is  so  much  hidden  immorality  among  Christians  –  and  even  
among preachers and pastors. The reports that one hears are only the 
tip of the iceberg. There is much more that is hidden. But where does 
this immorality begin? It begins in the heart and with wandering eyes, 
and when one does not run away from dangerous friendships.
At the same time, God may call some people, like Paul, to a single life. 
Paul says, “I wish that all men were like me, but each man has his own 
gift from God” (7:7). Paul accepted God’s will for him to be single. But he 
recognised  that  very  few  men  have  such  a  calling.  Paul  was  single  for  
the sake of the gospel. He could not possibly have run a home with all 
his travels. But times have changed. Today, one can travel to the other 
side of the world in less than 24 hours and return home equally quickly, 
whereas in Paul’s day, he would need a whole day to travel even 50 kilo-
metres. Such an apostle would find it very difficult to raise a family, if he 
had a wide ministry. That was why some apostles like Paul and Barnabas 
were single and others travelled with their wives. The other reason why 
Paul encouraged bachelorhood was because of persecution. In times of 
persecution, it is more risky to be a married man. It was in such a situa-
tion in the first century that Paul said “It is good for a man to be single.” 
There may be some situations today as well like that – but they are rare, 
probably in less than 1% of cases.
The  main  reason  why  Paul  encouraged  people  to  consider  the  single  
life was so that they could have “an undistracted devotion to the Lord” 
(7:35). And so he said, “If you live in this world, don’t get taken up with 

702 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
everything that happens in the world” (7:31). There are times when we 
will have to weep. But we shouldn’t get overwhelmed with our weeping. 
We must finish with it and move on. In the same way, we shouldn’t get 
so excited with the joy of our earthly possessions that our service for 
the Lord is hindered by our minds being occupied with such things. 
Get over the excitement quickly and get on with serving the Lord. Even 
if you are married, don’t let your wife and your home become everything 
to you (7:29). There is work to be done for the Lord, and your devotion 
to the Lord must be undistracted. The Lord must be first in your life.
I want you to notice one more important matter here. Paul says more 
than once: “I say to the unmarried... I say, but not the Lord... I don’t have 
a command from the Lord, but I give my opinion” (7:8, 12, 25). He differ-
entiated between the commands of the Lord and his personal opinions. 
It’s very important that, as God’s servants, we make this clear when we 
preach. There is nothing wrong in expressing our opinions – but we must 
make it clear to everyone that those are our personal opinions and not 
God’s commands.
Notice 7:40  as  well:  “In  my  opinion,  I  think  I  have  the  Spirit  of  God.” 
Observe Paul’s deep humility here. His opinion was certainly a very godly 
opinion but he didn’t have the arrogance that many have today who say, 
“Thus says the Lord.” I would rather listen to a man who says, “I think I 
have the Spirit of God,” than to somebody who says, “Thus says the Lord.” 
I have discovered in the 56 years that I have been a believer, that when 
someone  says,  “Thus  says  the  Lord,”  the  Lord  is  not  speaking  through  
him at all. He is just speaking from his own mind. But when a man is 
humble enough to say, “I think I have the Spirit of God when I say this,” 
it is more likely to be an expression of the mind of God.
A Mature Christian
In Chapter  8,  Paul  speaks  about  the  danger  of  using  our  liberty  to  do  
things that may cause others to stumble. In those days, all the meat that 
was sold in the market was presented to the idols in the temple before 
being sold. So those who had a problem with that decided to be vegetar-
ians. But there were other believers who said, “What is an idol? Just a 
piece of wood with a face carved on it. What does it matter if the meat was 
put in front of that piece of wood? I believe in only one God, the Father 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and so I give thanks for this meat and I eat it.”
Paul  says  here  that  each  believer  must  respect  the  other  believer’s  
point of view – and not force the other to conform to your view. (This is 
similar to his teaching in Romans 14). Here in India, when a neighbour 
gives you sweets at Diwali (a Hindu festival) time it is possible that this 
was offered in front of an idol first. What shall we do? Paul says later in 
1  Corinthians  10:25–28  (MSG),  “Eat  anything  sold  at  the  butcher  shop;  

A Mature Christian                                                                                                                                   703
1 Corinthians
you don’t have to run an ‘idolatry test’ on every item. The earth, after all, 
is God’s, and everything in it. That ‘everything’ certainly includes the leg 
of lamb in the butcher shop. If a nonbeliever invites you to dinner and you 
feel like going, go ahead and enjoy yourself; eat everything placed before 
you. It would be both bad manners and bad spirituality to cross-examine 
your host on the ethical purity of each course as it is served. On the other 
hand, if he goes out of his way to tell you that this or that was sacrificed 
to god or goddess so-and-so, you should pass. Even though you may be 
indifferent as to where it came from, he isn’t, and you don’t want to send 
mixed messages to him about who you are worshipping.” 
Here in Chapter 8, Paul says that these issues are not the most impor-
tant  things.  The  most  important  thing  is  love (verse  1). Knowledge  can  
make a person arrogant so that he looks down on others and says, “You 
don’t have any knowledge. You are scared of a block of wood!” But such 
a person may not have any love. If he did, he would be concerned that 
he does not cause those other believers to stumble. We must remember 
that those who have come out from idolatry have recognised those blocks 
of wood as gods for many years – and so their conscience bothers them. 
Your conscience does not bother you because you do not have that back-
ground. “But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become 
a stumbling block to the weak.... Therefore, (Paul says) if food causes my 
brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my 
brother to stumble” (8:9, 13). That is the position any mature Christian 
will take.
Let us apply this to our time. The Bible does not say that if you drink 
a little wine it’s a sin. The Bible only says you shouldn’t get drunk. But 
suppose  another  believer  sees  you  drinking  just  a  little  wine.  You  may  
have the self-control to stop with a small bit of wine. But when he sees 
you,  as  a  godly  brother,  drinking  wine,  he  also  does  the  same.  But  he  
does not have your self-control; and he begins to drink more and more 
and becomes a drunkard – and finally goes to hell. Who started him on 
the pathway to hell? You!! So what should a godly man do? He should 
deny himself the pleasure of drinking even a little wine. He doesn’t ask 
himself (like the self-centred believer), “Is it right or wrong?” No. He asks 
himself a higher question, “Will I stumble others?” And so he does not 
touch alcoholic drinks all his life. That is love. And when such self- denial 
can  save  souls  from  destroying  themselves  and  going  to  hell,  a  godly  
person is delighted to practise such self-denial.
This principle can have other applications too. If you go to someone’s 
home and discover that the man of the house is not at home, what should 
you do? It would be best not to go in – not because you will be tempted by 
his wife, but to preserve your testimony and to be an example to others. 
You may be totally pure; but someone else may follow your example and 
fall  into  sin  –  and  you  would  be  the  one  who  led  him  astray  by  your  
example. These are small matters – but if you live by the principle of love, 

704 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
you will be concerned about others all the time. To glory in our knowl-
edge  and  to  do  what  we  like,  unconcerned  about  what  effect  it  has  on  
others is the selfish way in which the heathen live. “When you cause your 
brother to stumble, you sin against Christ” (8:12).
Chapter 9 is about the subject of liberty. “Am I not an apostle? Why do I 
have to work like others? Why do I have to remain single?” All the apostles 
were married except Paul (9:5). So when a church teaches that one has to 
be single in order to serve the Lord full-time, that is a church that most 
of the apostles would have been disqualified from joining. Peter and John 
could never have joined such a church because they were married. That 
alone  should  prove  that  such  teaching  is  wrong.  If  the  apostles  them-
selves do not qualify to join a church, what type of church is it? Another 
thing that some churches say is that if one wants to serve the Lord, he 
must not have a secular job. Paul and Barnabas would then be disquali-
fied, because both of them supported themselves with secular jobs (9:6). 
Peter  and  John  were  supported  by  gifts  given  by  other  believers.  But  
Paul  and  Barnabas  supported  themselves.  So  you  can  be  an  apostle  
supporting yourself with a secular job, or one who is supported by other 
believers. And as an apostle, you can be married or unmarried. Marriage 
and a secular occupation are no disqualifications for apostleship.
Then Paul moves on to the subject of supporting the Lord’s servants. 
God says, “You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing” (9:9). That 
was an Old Testament law. When an ox threshed the grain, some selfish, 
hard  hearted  farmers  would  shut  the  mouth  of  the  ox,  so  that  it  does  
not  eat  some  of  the  grain.  So  God  commanded  that  the  ox  should  not 
be  muzzled.  Paul  says,  “Do  you  think  that  God  is  only  concerned  about  
oxen? That is written for our sake as well” (9:10). That was to teach that 
we must provide financially for those who serve the Lord so that they can 
feed themselves and their families. Paul goes on to say, “If we have sown 
spiritual things to you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?” 
We must financially support those who feed us with spiritual food. Paul 
was not talking here about a servant of the Lord collecting money from 
others to buy lands and property for his family. No. He was talking about 
a servant of the Lord receiving money for his necessities, to live with his 
family  in  a  simple  way.  But  this  provision  that  the  Lord  ordained  has  
been exploited by many preachers to make money for themselves.
“The  Lord  has  directed  that  those  who  proclaim  the  gospel  must  get  
their living from the gospel” (9:14). Those who preach the gospel have the 
right to receive gifts from believers who get the benefit of their ministry. 
(Galatians 6:6). I find two extremes in Christendom in this area. At one 
extreme are preachers who exploit this teaching to make a lot of money 
for themselves – and very often from believers who are much poorer than 
them.  This  is  scandalous.  At  the  other  extreme  are  believers  who  are  
stingy and who never recognise their financial debt to those who consist-
ently minister God’s Word to them. 

A Mature Christian                                                                                                                                   705
1 Corinthians
Having taught this principle, Paul then goes on to say, “I am not writing 
this so that you should now do this for me. I have never taken any money 
from you Corinthians. I earn my living with my own hands.” Paul was very 
discerning as to who he would accept money from. He accepted money 
from the church at Philippi (Philippians 4:14–18). But he never accepted 
a  cent  from  the  Christians  at  Corinth  or  Ephesus  or  Thessalonica  
(2 Corinthians 11:7–9; Acts 20:33, 34; 2 Thessalonians 3:7–9). Paul did 
not  live  by  a  rule  that  said,  “You  must  never  accept  money  from  any 
believer” nor by a rule that said, “You should accept money from every 
believer.” Whenever a gift was offered to him, Paul sought the leading of 
the Holy Spirit as to whether to accept it or not. This is what every true 
servant of God will also do.
There were very good reasons for Paul’s actions. First of all, he says, 
“I do it because I want to make the gospel free of charge” (9:18). People 
who hear the gospel must know that they don’t have to pay anything to 
hear the gospel. Throughout my life, in every public meeting that I have 
had  a  say  in  organising,  I  have  always  refused  to  permit  the  taking  of  
an offering – because there could be unbelievers in the crowd, and they 
should not feel that they have to pay even one cent to hear the gospel. 
This  was  the  practice  of  Jesus  and  the  apostles  –  they  never  took  an  
offering in any of their meetings. We have followed this practice even in 
all of our churches in India from the very beginning – because our believ-
ers  bring  their  unbelieving  friends  to  our  churches  to  hear  the  gospel.  
Believers alone  have  the  right  to  support  God’s  work.  Unbelievers  do  
not have that right (See 3 John 7). No unbeliever should be able to say 
to the Lord in the last day, “Lord, how can You send me to hell when I 
gave  money  to  support  Your  work  and  Your  servants  received  it  from  
me.” Unfortunately,  many  organisations  and  preachers  collect  money  
from people, irrespective of whether they are born again or not. If you are 
such a preacher, then the Lord will ask you in that day, “Why did you 
receive that money from one who was not My child?”
There  may  have  been  one  more  reason  why  Paul  did  not  accept  any  
money from the Corinthian Christians. They had questioned his apostle-
ship – and Paul would never accept any money from people who did not 
receive his ministry. This is the stand that every preacher should take 
as well.
Paul then speaks about disciplining his body so that he is not finally 
disqualified himself, after having preached to others (9:24–27). Solomon 
wrote three books of Scripture and still went to hell. That is a warning to 
all preachers. The apostle Paul – the man who established many churches, 
wrote Scripture, healed the sick, raised the dead, and preached so many 
wonderful sermons – feared lest he be disqualified. So he kept his bodily 
passions under control. Don’t ever imagine that because God has used 
you so much, He will definitely take you into His kingdom. Paul did not 
think so. God looks at our life primarily and not at our ministry.

Warnings and Guidelines
In Chapter  10,  Paul  continues  on  the  same  theme  and  warns  believ-
ers  from  the  example  of  the  600,000  Israelites  who  were  redeemed  by  
the blood of the lamb, but whom God was displeased with and did not 
permit to enter the land of Canaan. They perished in the wilderness. The 
same thing can happen to you, Paul says, because this was written as an 
example for us (10:6). Then, we have this wonderful promise of God that 
He “will never allow us to be tempted beyond our ability” (10:13). No temp-
tation can ever come into our lives that will be too much for us to deal 
with. This is what assures us that we can overcome every temptation and 
be victorious in every trial. Don’t ever say that any trial or temptation is 
too much for you. If you say that, you are actually saying that God is not 
faithful to His promise and that he is a liar. There is a way of escape in 
every temptation – and that is to ask God to give you grace to overcome. 
In 10:31, we have a wonderful guideline to find God’s will in all areas 
where  the  Bible  is  silent.  “Whatever  you  do,  do  all  to  the  glory  of  God.” 
Whenever you are in doubt about God’s will in any matter, ask yourself, 
“Can I do this for the glory of God?” If you feel that you cannot do it for 
God’s glory, then don’t do it. This verse must be the principle by which 
we live all of our life.
Chapter 11 speaks about two things – the covering of the head and the 
breaking of bread. 
Why should a man not cover his head when he prays or prophesies in 
the church and a woman cover her head? Three reasons are given:
1. “Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman” 
(11:3). Since Christ is the head of man and Christ should not be covered 
in the church, a man should not cover his head. Man, however, is the 
head of the woman and man should be covered in the church. So a 
woman should cover her head. Further, “man is the image and glory of 
God but the woman is the glory of man” (11:7). The glory of God should 
not be covered in the church and so a man should not cover his head. 
The woman, however, is the glory of the man – and man’s glory should 
be covered. So that is what a man testifies to by not covering his head 
and what a woman testifies to by covering her head. A priest who 
wears  a  cap  on  his  head  in  church  is  therefore  just  as  wrong  as  a  
sister who does not cover her head.
2. “If a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her” (11:15). All women know 
that long hair is part of their beauty – their glory. And the glory of the 
woman (her hair) should be covered in the church? The glory both of 
man and of the woman should be covered.
3. “The woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because 
of the angels” (11:10). By covering her head, a woman is showing that 
she is submissive to the authority of the man – to her husband or her

1 Corinthians
father – and if she is an orphan or a widow, then to the elders of her 
church. She is not rebellious like the angels that fell.
Unfortunately, Western influence has come into the churches of the 
cities of India and corrupted this teaching. But Paul concludes by saying, 
“If you are going to have a lot of arguments about this, I will just say this 
that every church of God practices this – and I am not going to get into an 
argument with you about this matter” (11:16).
It is clear, however, from this passage that women can pray and proph-
esy  in  the  church  meetings.  What  women  are  forbidden  to  do  in  the  
church are teaching and being elders (1 Timothy 2:12). But women can 
(and  should)  prophesy  –  that  is,  share  God’s  word  in  a  way  that  will  
“encourage, comfort and build up” the others (1 Corinthians 14:3).
We now move on to the subject of the Lord’s table (11:23–34). When we 
come to the Lord’s table, we remember the Lord’s death. We testify that 
Jesus gave His body to be broken for us and we want to be broken like 
He was. No-one else can break the bread and put it into our mouths – 
because no-one else can decide whether we want to be broken. We have 
to break that bread ourselves, for the symbolism to be accurate. We also 
testify that all of us who are partaking of this one bread are one body – 
the body of Christ (10:17). So this is a testimony of a covenant with the 
Lord, and of our unity with our fellow-believers.
If we don’t have such a vertical fellowship with our Lord as well as a 
horizontal fellowship with our fellow believers, then our breaking bread 
would be a lie. If we are bitter against someone, then we should not break 
bread. And if we do so, we could become sick – spiritually sick or physi-
cally sick, and even die spiritually (11:30). So we should judge ourselves 
rightly about these matters before breaking bread (11:31).
Gifts to Build Christ’s Body
In Chapter  12,  we  read  about  the  gifts  of  the  Spirit.  The  gifts  are  seen  
here in relationship to the functioning of the local church – the local Body 
of Christ. Many Christians think of the gifts of the Spirit without recog-
nising that they are to be used to build a local expression of the Body of 
Christ in every place. Therefore they go astray. We must seek for the gifts 
of the Spirit because we want to serve others better (Luke 11:5–13).
Many emphasise the first half of Chapter 12 (about the gifts), but not 
the second half (about the Body of Christ). Others emphasise the second 
half and ignore the first half. They are just like those who emphasise the 
second half of Chapter 11 but disobey the first half of Chapter 11 (saying 
that it does not apply to us today). 
If you want to understand the exercise of any of the gifts of the Spirit 
properly, you must always see them in the context of serving others and 
building  up  a  local  expression  of  the  Body  of  Christ  in  a  local  church.  

708 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
In 12:13,  Paul  speaks  of  the  universal  Body  of  Christ,  the  worldwide  
church (for he uses the word “we”). But in 12:27, he speaks about the 
local expression of that Body in Corinth (for he says “YOU are the body 
of Christ”).
The  gifts  of  the  Spirit  operate  in  the  Body  of  Christ  exactly  like  the  
different members of our body. Nobody should want to be a prominent 
member in the Body, like the ear or the eye. “If the whole body was just 
one  eye,  or  the  whole  body  was  just  eyes  where  would  the  hearing  be?  
And if the whole body was just ears, where would the sense of smell be? 
(12:17). There must be a nose too. So we shouldn’t desire anyone else’s 
gift. It is God Who makes someone an eye or a tongue in Christ’s Body. He 
may not want you to be a visible member like the tongue, but an invisible 
member like a heart, a liver or a kidney. But all these invisible members 
perform a very important function. Some parts of our human body are 
like  the  soles  of  our  feet  –  hard  and  capable  of  taking  a  lot  of  rough  
treatment. But other parts are weaker, and are very sensitive and easily 
injured, like our eyes. If one speck of dust gets into the eye it disturbs us 
continuously. But if our feet are covered with dust, that doesn’t cause us 
any problem. Also, some members of the body are attractive while other 
members are not so attractive – and so we hide them.
In the church also, there are some people who are very visible, like a 
preacher who is frequently in the pulpit. We could say that he is like the 
tongue. But most of the others in the Body never stand in a pulpit. They 
may be the “pray-er”s – those who pray much in private for the preacher. 
They  are  like  the  heart,  pumping  blood  so  that  the  mouth  can  speak.  
Both members are equally important. The mouth cannot speak without 
the heart pumping blood to it. But the heart will die if the mouth doesn’t 
open and eat food. The heart is dependent on the mouth and the mouth 
is dependent on the heart. So whatever gift of the Spirit you may have, 
remember that you need your brother and he needs you. That brother 
may be an invisible member like the heart which nobody sees or appreci-
ates and you may be a visible brother like the eyes or the hands.
There are many gifts of the Spirit, but there is no competition between 
them, but only cooperation. One may be an apostle, another a prophet 
(12:28),  one  may  speak  in  tongues,  and  another  may  have  the  gift  of  
healing. All are equally needed. Nobody needs another person’s gift. And 
nobody can say to another, “I don’t need you. I can do everything on my 
own” (12:21).
Is your left hand ever jealous of your right hand? The right hand may 
be  writing  all  the  important  letters  and  signing  all  the  cheques.  But  
does the left hand ever become jealous of that and think, “Oh, it is the 
right  hand  that  always  does  the  important  tasks.  I  don’t  ever  get  to  
do any important tasks.” And then suppose your right hand is injured 
one day and bound in plaster. Will the left hand now say, “Ah, now is 
my  chance  to  do  those  tasks”?  If  the  left  hand  were  to  sign  a  cheque  

Gifts to Build Christ’s Body                                                                                                                      709
1 Corinthians
now, it wouldn’t look like your signature and the bank won’t accept it! 
But what does the left hand actually do? It does everything possible to 
restore the right hand to health quickly so that the right hand can sign 
that cheque. That is how the Body of Christ should function. When you 
see another brother more gifted than you are, remember that even if you 
work hard you won’t be able to duplicate his ministry – because it was 
God Who gave Him that gift. It is enough that just one member in the 
body (the right hand) signs all the cheques. Wherever there is jealousy or 
competition in the Body of Christ, it is because believers have not seen 
the Body of Christ.
People  have  sometimes  asked  me  this  question,  “Brother  Zac,  why  
do you keep emphasising only holiness and balance in the Body all the 
time?” I reply with this question, “Why does a kidney only keep purify-
ing  the  blood  stream  and  balancing  the  chemicals  in  it  –  and  nothing  
else?”  Because  that  is  its  God-given  function.  That  is  not  every  func-
tion in the body – but it is an important one. Once your kidneys fail to 
function you will die. But the kidney cannot function without the hand 
and  the  mouth.  We  need  one  another.  Evangelism  is  something  like  a  
hand taking a potato and putting it into the mouth – bringing an unbe-
liever to Christ. But is that enough? No. After the unbeliever has come 
to Christ, someone else has to take over. The potato has to be chewed by 
the teeth and then go into the stomach, have acid poured on it, so that it 
is broken down. Finally, after many more processes, it becomes a part of 
the human body. In the same way, a new believer has to be broken down, 
made small and humbled and fitted for his task in Christ’s Body. That is 
how he becomes an effective member of Christ’s Body.
But suppose the potato just remains in the mouth or in the stomach, 
and  doesn’t  get  digested.  Then  you  will  just  vomit  it  out  after  a  while.  
So  the  evangelist  has  to  hand  over  the  convert  to  the  teacher  and  the  
prophet  and  the  shepherd  (Ephesians  4:11).  Which  of  these  minis-
tries is most needed? Even though there is a hierarchy in the gifts, the 
apostle, prophet and teacher being first, second and third respectively 
(1  Corinthians  12:28), yet  all  the  gifts  are  equally  needed.  So  we  must  
never  try  to  do  someone  else’s  ministry.  Cooperate  with  them  instead.  
Once you see this great truth, it will deliver you completely from all jeal-
ousy, competition and unrest.
Chapter  13  comes  between  Chapters  12  and  14  (both  of  which  deal  
with the gifts of the Holy Spirit). Sometimes believers forget that. Many 
believers who ignore the gifts of the Spirit speak much about Chapter 13. 
They jump from Chapter 11 to Chapter 13 and then from Chapter 13 to 
Chapter 15. Why do they leave out the chapters in between – Chapters 12 
and 14? Because they are against the gifts of the Holy Spirit. 
Paul wrote Chapter 13 to show believers how to exercise the gifts of the 
Spirit in “a more excellent way” (12:31). To exercise the gifts without love 
is something like using an electric wire without any insulation. It will kill. 

710 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
The gifts are powerful and will kill the user and others (spiritually) – if 
they are not exercised in love.
The  greatest  need  among  those  who  major  on  the  gifts  of  the  Spirit  
is  to  meditate  much  on  Chapter  13.  Having  all  the  most  supernatural  
gifts (miracles, healing, prophecy and tongues) and even sacrifice and 
Bible-knowledge will all still make you worthless in God’s work, if these 
are not all motivated by fervent love for God and fervent love for others. 
Love will make us humble, patient, considerate, unselfish, forgiving, etc. 
(13:4–7) and willing to acknowledge that we don’t have the full answer 
to many matters (13:12). Those who do not manifest all these qualities 
in using the gifts of the Spirit are actually babies and immature (13:11). 
They have not understood the very first lesson in the use of the gifts of 
the Spirit – and this unfortunately is the condition of many who claim to 
be baptised in the Spirit, today.
Chapter  14  tells  us  how  we  are  to  exercise  the  gift  of  tongues  and  
prophesy,  particularly  in  the  church.  In  14:5,  Paul  says.  “I  wish  that  
you all spoke in tongues, like me.” That doesn’t mean that everyone must 
speak in tongues. In Chapter 7:8, Paul had also said, “I wish that you all 
were single, like me.” That did not mean that all believers must remain 
unmarried.  Many  believers  who  quote  14:5  never  compare  it  with  7:8. 
In both verses, Paul was only expressing a personal desire. He was not 
giving a command from God. But Paul realised that most Christians are 
not  called  to  be  single.  And  he  also  realised  that  most  Christians  do  
not speak in tongues either. It is very clear from 14:5 that everybody in 
Corinth did not speak in tongues. When Christians are psychologically 
pressurised to speak in tongues, they will produce “tongues” themselves, 
in order to be accepted by the “tongue-speaking club”. Most of the “speak-
ing in tongues” today, unfortunately, falls in this category. The proof is 
that the speakers are not built up to a godly life, which is what genuine 
tongues does (14:4). 
At the same time, we are commanded in 14:39, “Don’t forbid to speak 
in  tongues.”  We  have  two  groups  in  Christendom  today  in  this  matter:  
One group urges every Christian to speak in tongues – going against 14:5 
and against 12:30 (“Do all speak in tongues?”). The other group forbids 
anyone to speak in tongues – disobeying 14:39. Both groups are going 
against the Scriptures.
It  is  also  clear  from  Chapter  14  that  the  gift  of  speaking  in  tongues  
is  different  from  the  way  the  apostles  spoke  in  tongues  on  the  day  of  
Pentecost.  On  the  day  of  Pentecost,  there  was  no  need  for  the  gift  of  
interpretation. The apostles spoke in tongues and everyone understood 
the language without any interpretation. This could have been a miracle 
either in the hearing of the hearers, or in the speaking of the apostles. 
But 14:5 here says, “What is the use of a man speaking in tongues unless 
he interprets?” If there is no interpreter, he should pray that he should 
interpret or else keep quiet (14:13, 27, 28). On the day of Pentecost, the 

Gifts to Build Christ’s Body                                                                                                                      711
1 Corinthians
“tongues” were many different languages that all the hearers automati-
cally understood. But here in Chapter 14, it is an overflow from the heart 
(bypassing  the  mind).  It  could  be  a  prayer,  or  a  word  of  challenge  or  
encouragement (14:6). Further, “interpretation” is not the same as trans-
lation. Translation is word for word. Interpretation is thought for thought. 
That’s  why  if  two  different  believers  were  to  interpret  the  same  tongue  
they would give the same message but express it in their own words.
In a church-meeting, a maximum of two or three people are permitted 
to speak in tongues (one at a time) – and if they do, each of those tongues 
must be interpreted by someone (14:27). A church where people speak in 
tongues simultaneously or without any interpretation, is a church that 
is disobedient to the word of God – and therefore I would have no respect 
for such a church. Many practices that we find in Pentecostal and charis-
matic churches today are in total contradiction to Scripture and are mere 
following  of  traditions  handed  down  from  previous  generations.  Many  
churches forbid speaking in tongues, while others follow the traditions of 
their forefathers. We must ignore both groups and follow the Scriptures 
alone.
Chapter 14 clearly teaches that the most important gift in a church- 
meeting is the gift of prophecy. Prophecy is not primarily foretelling the 
future. Throughout the Bible, the main burden of the message of every 
prophet was repentance and holiness. The greatest old covenant prophet, 
John the Baptist, never predicted the future. All the old covenant proph-
ets  called  God’s  people  to  repentance.  Predicting  the  future  was  rare  
under the old covenant and also in the new covenant. Prophecy (in the 
new covenant) is primarily speaking to men to build them up, encourage 
them, challenge them and comfort them (as clearly taught in 14:3). In the 
church-meetings, two or three prophets could speak first and then all the 
others were free to prophesy (14:29, 31).
Chapter 15 deals with the subject of the resurrection. Paul was trying 
to  convince  the  Corinthian  Christians  that  there  would  certainly  be  a  
resurrection. The body of every human being that ever lived will be resur-
rected one day – to face God’s judgement. And in the day of resurrection 
and rewards for Christians, although all true believers will be in God’s 
kingdom, not all of them will receive the same degree of glory. “There is 
one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon and another glory of the 
stars. Star differs from star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead” 
(15:41, 42). Those believers who have been more faithful on earth will be 
like the brighter stars, and those who have been less faithful will have 
less glory – throughout eternity. So we are urged to “be steadfast, immov-
able, always abounding in the work of the Lord” now (15:58).
In Chapter  16,  we  see  the  freedom  that  Paul  gave  his  co-workers.  In  
16:12, Paul says that he had urged Apollos to go to Corinth to teach the 
Word. But Apollos did not feel free in his spirit to go. So Paul told him to 
go whenever he (Apollos) felt free to go. This is a beautiful example of the 

712 Through the Bible: The Local Church – And Its Functioning 
1 Corinthians
freedom that we should give one another in Christ’s body, even if we have 
apostolic authority. There must be no compulsion.
Finally, a word for us all: “Let all that you do be done in love” (16:14). If 
we obey that word, we can never go wrong. That is how we can all do 
our part to build our local churches.

2 CORINTHIANS
The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
T
he ministry in any church depends to a large extent on the work 
that God can do in the life of the leader of that church. In Revelation 
Chapters 2 and 3, we see clearly that where the leader was a back-
slider, the church also backslid; and where the leader was faithful, the 
church also was faithful. I have observed this to be true in churches in 
many parts of the world that I have visited. Where the leader is a compro-
miser, the church is a compromising church. Where the leader is a godly 
man, the church is usually godly – because the ungodly will get offended 
and leave such a church, leaving behind a godly remnant.
1 Corinthians deals with a local church in a city. 2 Corinthians deals 
with the inner life of the leader who leads the local church. 1 Corinthians 
deals with spiritual gifts, how to conduct church-meetings, breaking of 
bread, discipline in the church, and other matters like that. 2 Corinthians 
deals  with  God’s  preparation  of  the  man  who  leads  that  church.  Paul  
reveals his inner life to us in 2 Corinthians more than in any other letter 
of his.
In Acts of the Apostles, we read what Paul did and accomplished as an 
apostle. But in 2 Corinthians we read about all that God allowed him to 
go through in order to make him the man of God he became. Anyone who 
wants to serve the Lord must meditate on 2 Corinthians to see how God 
prepares a man for His service. Paul’s ministry was effective, not primar-
ily  because  of  the  gifts  God  gave  him,  but  because  of  his  inner  walk  
with God. An earthen vessel may not look impressive, but if it contains 
water it will satisfy the need of a thirsty man more than an empty golden 
cup.  Some  gifts  of  the  Spirit  are  spectacular  like  the  golden  cup  and  
others look very ordinary like the earthen vessel. But it is what the vessel 
contains that is important. So, it’s not enough to have a gift of the Spirit. 
Gifts of the Spirit are necessary, but it is our inner life that we commu-
nicate to others through our gift.

2 Corinthians
1 Corinthians emphasises the gift, while 2 Corinthians emphasises the 
vessel.
A Ministry that Comes Through Afflictions
In 2  Corinthians 1:1–8,  we  see  how  Paul  obtained  his  ministry.  It  was  
not just because God had anointed him with the Holy Spirit. Many who 
are anointed with the Holy Spirit do not have a ministry where rivers of 
living waters are flowing through them – because they haven’t under-
stood 2 Corinthians. They have understood only the anointing of the Holy 
Spirit,  and  thought  that  that  was  the  answer  to  everything.  They  have  
not allowed God to do a work of breaking in their inner life. It was when 
the rock was struck that the rivers of water flowed out  (Exodus  17:6; 
Psalm 105:41).
In 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4, we read in a nutshell how Paul obtained his 
ministry. He uses the word “comfort” here which means strength (from 
the word “fort”). So the verse reads thus: “Blessed be the God and Father 
of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  Father  of  mercies  and  God  of  all  strength  
Who strengthens us in all our afflictions, so that we can strengthen others 
who are in affliction, with the same strength that God gave us in our afflic-
tions.” We are surrounded by people who are facing all types of trials and 
afflictions. If we are to help them to be overcomers, then we have to go 
first through many trials and afflictions ourselves and overcome in all of 
them. The strength and encouragement and victory that God gives us to 
overcome is what we can then share with others. This is new-covenant 
ministry.
New-covenant  ministry  does  not  come  through  studying  Christian  
books and listening to tapes and thus preparing sermons. No. One has 
to go through many afflictions in secret. Jesus was tempted in all points 
as we are so that He could be a Forerunner for all of us. Because He has 
faced every temptation and overcome, He can say to us, “Follow Me.” Now 
we have to be mini-forerunners for others around us – and we have to say 
to them, “Follow me as I follow Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1).
 If Paul had not gone through many trials and afflictions in his life, he 
would  never  have  had  a  ministry,  even  if  he  had  every  gift  of  the  Holy  
Spirit. Many say, “Bible-study is not enough. We also need the anointing 
of the Holy Spirit.” But I say, “Even these two are not enough. We also 
need to go through many trials and through God’s help overcome in all 
of them.” Thus we will become new-covenant servants of God. We need 
to spend hours studying God’s word to understand God’s mind. We also 
need to seek God in prayer to receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit. And then 
God has to take us through the education of trial. Thus He can give us 
an effective ministry.
“As the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our strength 
is abundant through Christ” (1:5). Paul tells us here how we can be strong 

A Ministry that Comes Through Afflictions                                                                                          715
2 Corinthians
enough to help others. We may have to go through rejection by parents 
and relatives and being despised by others. We may have to go through 
financial difficulties and even sickness.
Health is a very useful gift of God. But it is not a necessary require-
ment  for  serving  God.  Paul  had  a  sickness  that  he  called  “a  thorn  in  
the flesh”,  that  God  could  have  taken  away  but  which  He  never  did.  
Timothy’s “thorn” was a frequent stomach ailment that God never healed 
him of – despite Paul’s prayers for him (1 Timothy 5:23). Timothy had to 
take medication for his sickness all his life. Paul and Timothy were two 
of the most effective servants of God in the New Testament. Sickness not 
only  did  not  hinder  them  from  serving  God,  but  made  them  serve  God  
even  better!  God  used  their  “thorns”  to  keep  them  humble  –  and  thus  
they were empowered by God’s all-sufficient grace, which He gives only 
to the humble (2 Corinthians 12:7; 1 Peter 5:5). So it is best to leave it to 
God to decide which is best for us – health or sickness.
Many preachers today give people the impression that a lot of money 
is necessary to do God’s work. But this is totally untrue. Paul had very 
little  money  most  of  the  time.  At  times  he  didn’t  even  have  enough  
money  to  buy  food  or  warm  clothes  for  himself  (2  Corinthians  11:27). 
Why did God allow His greatest servants to be without even food and 
warm clothing, when worldly companies give their employees so much 
more than all this? Because God had to teach Paul first of all to be 
content and thankful under all circumstances. He also wanted Paul to 
experience how other people in the world feel when they don’t have food 
and warm clothing. To serve God, we have to experience what others go 
through.
In the early years of my married life, we had very little money – and we 
struggled financially for some years. But that was a blessed time of trust-
ing God. We learned in those days to live simply, within our means, never 
to  borrow  money,  and  never  to  be  in  debt  to  anyone.  We  got  closer  to  
God and closer to each other as husband and wife. The lessons in simple 
living  that  we  learned  in  those  days  remain  with  us,  today,  47  years  
later. My wife and I are deeply thankful for those early years. Financial 
difficulties were a major part of our spiritual education. In the same way, 
rejection,  misunderstanding  and  false  accusation  have  also  been  used  
by God to strengthen us. We can never have an effective ministry unless 
we  experience  such  trials.  So  don’t  envy  those  who  have  an  easy  way  
through life. They won’t have a rich ministry.
Paul goes on to say, “We don’t want you to be unaware, brethren, of our 
affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, 
beyond  our  strength,  so  that  we  despaired  even  of  life”  (1:8).  He  went  
through so many afflictions that he thought he may even die. It is good 
that Paul has written a little bit about what he went through. He hasn’t 
given  us  all  the  details.  But  he  has  shared  a  little  bit  so  that  we  don’t  
imagine  that  his  ministry  came  merely  through  Bible-study  and  the  

716 Through the Bible: The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
2 Corinthians
anointing of the Spirit. Paul had to go through many trials; and what he 
mentions here and in Chapter 11 are only a small portion of them.
Restoration and Forgiveness
In Chapter 2, we read about the restoration of the brother whom Paul had 
disciplined earlier (1 Corinthians 5). Now Paul says, “You should receive 
him back now” (2:6–8). That brother had learnt his lesson when everyone 
in the church avoided him – and he saw how dark it was out in the world. 
He had set matters right and given up his sinful ways. But now he was 
discouraged and depressed, sitting alone at home. Paul asked the church 
to restore him.
The purpose of all discipline is to bring a brother back into fellowship 
with God and the church. A father disciplines his child, not to drive him 
out of the house, but to make him a better son. If the son is a grown man 
and rebellious, then the father may tell him to leave his house. But even 
in such a case, once the son has learnt his lesson (like the prodigal son), 
the father will welcome him back home. This is what Paul is saying here. 
Paul says, “If you forgive him anything, I also forgive” (2:10). And then, 
there is a word for all of us: “We must forgive others so that no advantage 
is taken of us by Satan” (2:11). It is extremely dangerous to live without 
having forgiven someone.
If someone has done you harm and you don’t forgive him, Satan can 
destroy your life. The person who harmed you may repent later and enter 
God’s kingdom. But you, who never did him any wrong, may go to hell, 
because you didn’t forgive him. That looks unrighteous – that the person 
who did the wrong goes to heaven and you who suffered the wrong goes 
to hell. But it can happen if he repents and you don’t forgive him. Jesus 
said, “If  you  don’t  forgive  someone,  My  heavenly  Father  will  not  forgive  
you” (Matthew 6:15). If your heavenly Father does not forgive you, how 
can  you  enter  heaven?  So  if  you  die  without  forgiving  anyone,  as  per  
Jesus’ word here, you will go to hell, irrespective of how long you were 
a believer before that. So, we must develop the habit of forgiving others 
immediately, no matter what harm they did to us. Otherwise Satan will 
get an advantage over us.
Paul says, “We are not ignorant of his schemes” (2:11). Satan is always 
trying to trip us up. Why do you think Satan constantly reminds you of 
the evil things that others have done to you in the past? Do you think he 
is sympathising with you? No. He already got a hold of that other person 
to harm you. Now he wants to get a hold of you as well! Don’t be ignorant 
of his schemes. Forgive everyone.
Once a brother came to me and complained that someone had done a 
number of evil things to him. I asked him, “Has he crucified you yet?” He 
said, “No.” So I told him, “Then you have a long way yet to go in following 
Jesus, because He forgave even those who crucified Him.” 

Seeking to Please God Alone                                                                                                                  717
2 Corinthians
Many unbelievers and believers have tried to harm me during these 56 
years that I have been a believer. But Romans 8:28 has been like a filter 
for me all these years; and so the evil that they have tried to do to me has 
always worked for my good – to make me more like Christ (Romans 8:29). 
One day, God will certainly judge all those who have tried to harm His 
children (2 Timothy 4:14). But our duty is to forgive them all.
The thing that has helped me to forgive those who hate me has been to 
see anger and hatred as sicknesses. Sin is worse than the most deadly 
sickness. If someone is jealous of me, or hates me, or wants to harm me, 
or my ministry, he is sick. So I look at him as I would look at someone 
who has cancer and AIDS and leprosy (all combined). If you see a person 
with these three diseases, would you be angry with him? No. You would 
feel sorry for him. Once God opened my eyes to see people in this way, 
it was easy to forgive them. I could even pray that they would be healed. 
“A gentle answer turns away wrath” (Proverbs 15:1). That is the way of 
Christ.
Paul’s  testimony  in  2:14  –  “Thanks  be  to  God  who  always  leads  us  
in His triumph in Christ” – came to me as a challenge many years ago – 
  especially  the  word  ‘always.’  I  wondered  if  that  was  possible.  Paul  
experienced  constant  triumph  –  and  thanked  God  for  giving  Him  such  
a life. He didn’t say that he was walking in triumph by his own power. 
No. He said that it was God Who led him in triumph always. So Paul was 
an  overcomer.  He  wasn’t  perfect.  He  did  slip  up  occasionally.  Towards  
the end of his life he once got angry and shouted at the high priest (Acts 
23:3). But he humbled himself and asked for forgiveness, as soon as he 
was aware of his sin. Thus his fellowship with God was restored imme-
diately – and he lived an overcoming life constantly.
Seeking to Please God Alone
If you want to build a church that satisfies God’s heart, you must seek 
to please God in every area. God wants to lead you in triumph in your 
personal life, not once in a while, but daily. It won’t be in your strength. 
God Himself will lead you in triumph in Christ – always. A true servant 
of God will be able to testify: “Thanks be to God who always leads me in 
triumph in every single place, and manifests through me the sweet aroma 
of  the  knowledge  of  Christ.”  It  was  the  fragrance  of  Christ  that  came  
through Paul wherever he went – and not his own fragrance. And so God 
got all the glory.
But for some people, Paul was a fragrance of death (2:16). Not every-
one appreciates the full-gospel message. One would think that everyone 
should be delighted to hear the message of victory. But many do not like 
the  message,  because  it  shows  up  their  sin.  When  Jesus  came  mani-
festing  the  life  of  God,  many  hated  Him  and  put  Him  to  death.  Many  
Christian leaders are the same today. They do not like their love of money, 

718 Through the Bible: The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
2 Corinthians
their love of honour and their defeated life at home, to be exposed by the 
message of constant victory. And so they will hate you if you preach that 
message. They will hate you because you are shining a light on their sins.
If someone was committing a robbery in the darkness and you shone 
a flashlight at him, he would hate you. A true servant of God shines the 
flashlight of God’s Word into the dark corners of people’s hearts. Those 
who  love  sin  will  hate  him  and  call  him  a  false  prophet  and  heretic  –  
because he exposed their sin. But those who are groping in the darkness, 
looking for the safe path, will be thankful to him, because they can now 
see  the  way.  So  there  are  two  reactions  to  the  light.  Some  hate  it  and  
some are deeply thankful for it. Jesus fills us with the Holy Spirit and 
manifests His power and His triumph through us everywhere. Some will 
be thankful for us and others will hate us. But thereby the true condition 
of each person will be revealed.
2:17 is a word that all Christian workers should take heed to: “We are 
not like many people who peddle the word of God.” To “peddle the word 
of God” is to sell it for money. What Paul is saying is that “we are not 
like  other  preachers  who  are  making  money  out  of  preaching  God’s  
word.” All who serve the Lord should be able to say at the end of their 
lives, “I did not spend a single day of my life preaching God’s word in 
order to make money”. Let the vegetable vendors and sellers of earthly 
goods  peddle  their  wares  for  money.  But  we  do  not  peddle  the  word  
of God. We serve others freely, expecting no gifts or payments for our 
services. As the Lord gave us everything freely, we too give everything 
freely to others. Such is the dignity of a true servant of God.
New Covenant Servants
In Chapter 3 Paul speaks about a new covenant servant. There is a vast 
difference  between  new  covenant  servants  and  old  covenant  servants.  
In  the  old  covenant,  there  were  a  few  prophets  like  Hosea,  Isaiah  and  
Ezekiel who had to go through some trials for them to learn God’s ways 
and to obtain His message. But generally speaking, the Old Testament 
priests did not have to go through any trials in order to have a ministry 
as priests of God. They only had to study and understand God’s laws and 
explain those laws to the people. They studied and they preached. If all 
your preaching comes merely as a result of your study, you are an old 
covenant servant. A new covenant servant does not get his ministry by 
studying alone. He has to experience the message. Then he speaks out of 
his experience. He does not say, “Come and hear,” but, “Come and see.”
In 3:5, Paul says, “We are not sufficient for this ministry.” He says that 
we are incapable of producing what is required for this fantastic minis-
try of the new covenant. But our sufficiency comes from God. A new 
covenant  servant  does  not  depend  on  anything  within  himself  in  order  

New Covenant Servants                                                                                                                           719
2 Corinthians
to  serve  God.  He  receives  his  ability  entirely  from  God.  God  gives  it  to  
him and He gives it out – just like the servants in Cana distributed the 
new  wine.  Those  servants  took  water  to  Jesus.  He  turned  it  into  wine.  
Then they distributed it. In the same way the disciples took five loaves 
and two fish to Jesus. He multiplied them – and they distributed them. 
We also take our limited resources to the Lord. He anoints them, blesses 
them and multiplies them; and we pass them on to others. That is how 
we are to serve. We are called to be in the distribution business, not in 
the production business – not even the production of sermons. When we 
speak, we are to minister life to others – not knowledge.
Many Christian workers are discouraged, gloomy and depressed after 
a few years of serving God; and some even get a nervous breakdown. 
This  is  because  they  tried  to  serve  God  with  their  own  sufficiency. 
We must depend on God to equip us for His service. We need to trust 
God  even  for  physical  health  if  we  are  to  serve  Him.  God’s  promise  
is, “Those who wait upon the Lord shall exchange their strength. Even 
young men will faint, but you will mount up with wings like an eagle” 
(Isaiah  40:31). Our sufficiency comes from God. Even if you are in 
financial difficulty, trust this promise: “Our sufficiency is from God.” 
Whatever we need, God is well able to supply.
He has made us servants of the new covenant. In the new covenant, we 
are not servants of the letter but of the Spirit (3:6). In 3:9, two ministries 
mentioned – a ministry of condemnation and a ministry of righteousness. 
A  ministry  of  condemnation  is  one  where  people  feel  condemned  after  
listening  to  the  message.  You  may  think  your  sermon  was  wonderful,  
because people felt convicted and condemned. But it was an old covenant 
ministry. The law condemns people and constantly tells them: “You are 
not good enough, you were not good enough.” A lot of preaching today in 
so-called revival meetings is just telling people, “You are not good enough. 
You  are  bad.  You  are  bad.  You  are  bad.”  And  people  sit  there  feeling  
condemned.  That  is  not  Christian  preaching.  Christian  preaching  will  
lead people to righteousness and to a glorious life; it will not stop with 
convicting people, but will go on to lift them up, heal them and deliver 
them by the end of the message. Thus they go away with hope. If your 
preaching brings people into bondage, you can be sure that you are an 
old-covenant  servant.  If  your  preaching  makes  people  feel  condemned,  
that is old-covenant preaching. If you push people down instead of lifting 
them  up,  that  is  old-covenant  preaching.  New-covenant  preaching  lifts  
people up and gives them hope.
In 3:13–18, Paul compares the new covenant with the old covenant, in 
terms of Moses and Christ. When Moses was in God’s presence, the glory 
shone on his face. When he came down from the mountain, he would put 
a veil over his face. In Exodus it says that he put the veil so that people 

720 Through the Bible: The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
2 Corinthians
would not be afraid to look at him. But here we are given another reason. 
As time went on, the glory on Moses’ face under that veil became less and 
less; and so he put the veil over his face, so that the Israelites would not 
see that the glory was gradually disappearing (verse 13). There are many 
Christians today in whose private life the glory is becoming less and less. 
When some of today’s 50-year old preachers were 25 years old, they were 
on fire for God. But now their attitude to money and sin and many other 
matters  have  become  un-Christlike.  This  is  one  of  the  main  marks  of  
old-covenant ministry – the glory fades away.
In a new-covenant ministry it’s exactly the opposite. We don’t have to 
put a veil over our face. We don’t have to hide anything in our private 
life.  Jesus  never  came  with  a  veil  over  His  face,  because  in  the  new  
covenant this veil is taken away. “When you turn to the Lord the veil is 
taken away” (3:16). Now when we see the glory of Jesus in God’s Word, 
the Holy Spirit changes us from one degree of glory to another so that 
His glory in us increases day by day (verse 18). In other words, if we are 
submitted totally to the Spirit, the anointing upon our life will be more 
today than it was a few years ago, and much more than it was 30 years 
ago.  But  if  you  are  not  faithful,  then  the  glory  will  decrease  in  your  
life as you grow older. Many, many zealous young people backslide as 
soon as they get married. Why does that happen? If you marry in the 
will of God, your zeal and glory will be far more than when you were 
single. But the glory will decrease, if your wife, or your home, become 
more  important  to  you  than  the  Lord.  Such  a  man  stops  seeing  the  
glory of the Lord and begins to backslide.
Some  brothers,  when  they  were  unknown,  ordinary  people  serving  
God, had a tremendous anointing and glory in their lives. But as their 
ministry  spread  and  they  became  well  known,  they  lost  their  anoint-
ing. They began to be more concerned about what people thought about 
them. Or perhaps, when they started their ministry they had very little 
money and they were very careful with their money. But as they mingled 
with other Christian workers who loved money, they became like them. 
Then the glory began to fade away. 
It is very easy for such things to take away the glory from our lives. And 
most preachers, when the glory is fading away, try to cover it up – just 
as Moses did. Make sure that doesn’t happen in your life, because that is 
not the will of God. It must be the opposite in our lives – the glory must 
increase. So look steadfastly into God’s word and see the glory of Jesus 
always. That is how we can be preserved.
2  Corinthians  3:18  is  the  one  verse  that  best  describes  the  ministry  
of  the  Holy  Spirit  in  the  entire  New  Testament.  When  the  Holy  Spirit  
becomes Lord in our lives, He brings liberty. “Where the Spirit of the Lord 
is, there is liberty” (verse 17). He frees us primarily from the power of sin, 

The Glory of Christ in an Earthen Vessel                                                                                               721
2 Corinthians
but also from the love of money, from the traditions of our fathers and 
elders  that  are  contrary  to  the  Word,  from  the  opinions  of  people,  etc.  
This is a great freedom indeed. Then we become free to serve God and not 
man. In 3:18, we are told that the Holy Spirit shows us the glory of Jesus 
in the Scriptures (The mirror is the Word of God – James 1:23–25). Some 
people read the Bible only to get sermons and check doctrines. But the 
Holy Spirit primarily wants to shows us the glory of Jesus in the Bible. 
As we see that glory, the Holy Spirit also changes us into that likeness.
That likeness includes likeness to Christ in the way He ministered as 
well. We will begin to minister like Him. The Spirit will show us how Jesus 
made sacrifices in order to serve His Father – and He will make us make 
sacrifices also to serve the Lord.  Our  life  and  our  ministry  will  change  
radically if we allow the Holy Spirit to transform us. We will become new 
covenant servants – and we don’t have to leave our secular employment 
to  be  that.  Any  brother  or  sister  in  the  church  can  be  a  new  covenant  
servant.
In 4:1,  Paul  continues  to  describe  his  ministry.  “Because  we  have  
received this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart.” To lose 
heart means to get discouraged. Even the apostle Paul was tempted to be 
discouraged. So if you are tempted to be discouraged, that should not be 
considered strange. I have been tempted many times to get discouraged. 
But I have said like Paul, “We don’t get discouraged because we keep our 
eyes on Jesus and we think of the wonderful ministry that God has given 
us.” So,  although  we  will  all  be  tempted  to  be  discouraged,  none  of  us  
need EVER get discouraged, if we keep our eyes fixed on the Lord.
In 4:2,  Paul  says,  “We  have  renounced  the  things  hidden  because  of  
shame, not walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God.” If you 
want to serve the Lord there must be nothing in your life that you have to 
hide because of shame. If there is something, confess it, set it right before 
God and cleanse it away. Your life should be transparent. That is one of 
the most important requirements to be a new-covenant servant. What is 
craftiness? When you write what you call “a prayer-letter”, but your main 
aim is to get money from people for yourself or for your ministry, then 
you are being crafty. You should be honest and call it “A letter asking for 
money.” There is a lot of dishonesty like that among Christian workers. If 
you feel you should ask people for money, do it, but don’t give your letter 
a “holy” title! That is just one example of craftiness. Paul says, “We have 
renounced all this. We don’t want any of it in our life. We want to judge 
ourselves and cleanse out all of that from our lives. We want to commend 
ourselves to every man.”
The Glory of Christ in an Earthen Vessel
Then  Paul  begins  to  explain  what  the  gospel  is.  Many  people  cannot  
understand the gospel because Satan (the god of this world) has blinded 

722 Through the Bible: The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
2 Corinthians
their eyes so that they cannot see it. Paul speaks here about the glory of 
God as the only real treasure that we can have on earth (verse 6). Just as 
God commanded light to shine way back in Genesis 1, He has also shone 
into our hearts – and this light is in an earthen vessel (4:7). Till the end 
of our lives, we will all be only earthen vessels. The only attractive thing 
about this vessel is that it contains the glory of God.
In  the  Old  Testament,  Abraham  and  David  were  materially  wealthy.  
That was an earthly glory – because all human beings glory in wealth. 
But in the New Testament, God used a man like Paul, who was both 
poor  and  unimpressive.  Tradition  tells  us  that  the  Apostle  Paul  was  
only  4  feet  11  inches  tall,  bald,  having  a  hooked  nose  and  sick  for  
much of his life. When he stood up to speak, he was not a very impres-
sive  personality.  But  this  was  the  man  God  used  to  “turn  the  world  
upside down” – because he was anointed (Acts 17:6). Paul was actually 
turning  the  world  “right  side  up”,  because  the  whole  world  has  been  
upside down, ever since Adam sinned. He was a weak earthen vessel 
but  one  that  contained  the  glory  of  Christ  inside.  It’s  what’s  inside  
you that really counts. Many people today are impressed by so-called 
great servants of God who stand on platforms like film stars. But that’s 
not the picture we get of a true servant of God from the apostle Paul. 
He  was  not  a  golden  vessel.  He  was  an  earthen  vessel.  So  don’t  get  
discouraged if you find many human limitations and weaknesses in 
you. Ensure that there is a great glory inside – that you walk with a 
clear conscience before God and live under the anointing of the Holy 
Spirit all the time. That’s what really matters.
The light in an earthen vessel (4:6, 7) reminds us of Gideon’s army of 
300 soldiers who had an earthen vessel each, with a light inside. These 
300 were selected from a larger group of 32,000 by God, and are a type 
of the overcomers in the last days. When they go to battle against Satan, 
like  those  soldiers,  they  have  a  sword  (which  is  the  word  of  God).  But  
they  also  have  an  earthen  vessel  with  a  light  inside.  Gideon’s  soldiers  
were told to break their earthen vessels so that their lights would shine 
out. If you put a candle inside a pot, you will hardly be able to see its 
light. But if the pot is broken, the light shines forth. Paul tells us how 
his earthen vessel had to be broken for the life of Jesus to shine forth. 
He had to go through affliction, perplexity, persecution and being struck 
down,  without  despairing  (verses  8–12).  Thus  his  earthen  vessel  was  
broken and people could see the light (the life of Jesus) clearly in him. 
Many believers don’t understand this, and they are not interested either. 
But this way of the cross alone is the way of life.
When you sow a grain of wheat into the ground, its hard outer shell 
cracks open. Only then can the life within be released. Even in us born-
again Christians, there is the hard outer shell, of our soulish personality 

The Glory of Christ in an Earthen Vessel                                                                                               723
2 Corinthians
and our flesh, which has to be broken. Only then will the light of the glory 
of God shine forth from us.
This is a principle that we see right through Scripture. When a woman 
brought  an  alabaster  vial  of  perfume  to  Jesus,  there  was  wonderful  
perfume  inside.  But  no-one  in  the  house  could  get  the  scent  of  that  
perfume until the vial was broken. In the same way, God has to take us 
through various circumstances where our outer life is broken. Then we 
will no longer be attractive to people. You may want to come across to 
others as a very smart person. But God says, “Let Me break this desire 
of  yours.”  Man  comprises  of  spirit,  soul  and  body.  There  is  a  tremen-
dous glory that dwells in our spirit when Christ comes in. But our soul 
life hinders that glory from shining forth. That’s why God allows many a 
breaking in our lives – so that we fulfil His purpose.
4:10, 11 are verses that are misunderstood by most Christians. Many 
believers are eager to hear of a gospel that will do physical miracles in 
their lives. But if you want the life of Jesus to be manifested in you, 
the answer lies in these verses. We have to carry the dying of Jesus in 
our body. What is this “dying of Jesus”? It is to die to our own will and 
our self-life the way Jesus did during His entire 33½ years on earth 
(John 6:38).
That means reacting to life’s situations the way Jesus reacted when He 
was on earth. How did He react when people called Him the devil, when 
Judas Iscariot stole His money, when people spat on Him, when people 
called  Him  an  illegitimate  son  (the  son  of  Mary),  when  people  insulted  
Him,  robbed  Him,  abused  Him,  told  Him  to  stop  preaching  and  threw  
Him out of the synagogue? He died to human honour, prestige, reputa-
tion and dignity, and to His own will. That is the “dying of Jesus.” You 
and I have no part in the dying of Jesus on Calvary. We cannot die for the 
sins of the world. But there was a dying in His life that went on every day 
of His earthly life. That is the dying that we have to share in.
Why is it called “the dying of Jesus”? Because Jesus was the first Person 
who walked this way of death to self and to the things of this world. He 
died to everything that was human, and thus He manifested the glory of 
the Father. You and I are called to follow in Jesus’ footsteps. 
In 4:17, 18, Paul says, “All this affliction that we go through is very light 
because the glory that is going to come into us through them is so great.” 
But this glory can come into us only as long as “we keep looking at the 
things that are unseen and refuse to look at the things that are seen” (4:18). 
That  means  that  we  don’t  look  at  any  of  our  sufferings  from  a  human  
viewpoint,  but  from  a  Divine  viewpoint.  There  is  a  glory  that  is  worked  
into our lives through these trials and we get into closer fellowship with 
Jesus’ heart. That is why we are encouraged; and that is the way we get a 
ministry. We don’t get a ministry by studying God’s Word alone.

724 Through the Bible: The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
2 Corinthians
Paul longs to explain to us the way to have a spiritual ministry in the 
new covenant. Let us listen to him. 2 Corinthians describes the inner life 
of a man whom God uses to fulfil His will. God  has  given  us  Jesus  as  
our ultimate Example. But He has also given us Paul as an example of 
a servant of God. We don’t see Jesus establishing churches, appointing 
elders and dealing with church discipline etc. But we do see Paul doing 
these things.
An Ambition to Please God Alone
In 5:9, Paul speaks about his ambition. All young people have ambitions. 
The problem is they have got the wrong ambitions. The ambition of many 
is to make money, or to become great and famous, and to make a name 
for themselves. Paul also got an ambition when he was converted. “We 
have  as  our  ambition  whether  at  home  or  absent  –  whether  we  are  in  
heaven or absent from heaven – to please Him” (5:9). He was saying that 
when  he  got  to  heaven,  his  ambition  would  not  change.  It  would  be  to  
please God alone. Can we honestly say that when we get to heaven we 
will have the same ambition that we have right now on earth? That is the 
identifying mark of a truly spiritual man. He is in tune with God, because 
he is in tune with heaven’s values. Such a man will be the most effective 
servant of God on earth because he is in tune with heaven. The trouble 
with a lot of Christian workers today is that they are not in tune with God 
or heaven. If you want to please God only after you get to heaven, then I 
wonder whether you will get to heaven at all.
In 5:10, 11, Paul says, “We must all appear before the judgment seat of 
Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, 
according to what he has done, whether good or bad. Therefore, knowing 
the fear of the Lord, we persuade men.” The judgement-seat of Christ is 
the  place  where  believers  alone  will  be  judged  and  rewarded  according  
to the degree of their faithfulness. This is different from the great white 
throne where all unbelievers will be judged (Revelation 20:11, 12). One 
day we will stand before the judgement seat of Christ and be evaluated 
for everything that we ever did in our whole lives – our actions, words, 
thoughts, motives and attitudes. Then we will be rewarded accordingly.
There  are  many  things  God  gives  us  –  365  days  every  year,  many  
opportunities to bless others, money, intelligence and other gifts. When 
we reach the other end of life’s journey we will be evaluated for how we 
used these gifts.
Then Paul says, “It is the love of Christ that controls us” (5:14). These 
two things mentioned here should be the motivating forces in our life 
– a reverential fear of the Lord and the love of Christ. It was thus that 
Paul lived such an effective life for the Lord.

An Ambition to Please God Alone                                                                                                         725
2 Corinthians
Then  Paul  speaks  about  the  great  truth  that  we  all  died  with  Christ  
when He died on the cross (5:14). He speaks about this truth in Romans, 
Corinthians and Galatians. “I am crucified with Christ.” “If one died, then 
all died.” This was a unique revelation that God gave Paul. We don’t read 
Peter, John or James writing about it. When Jesus died and rose again, 
in God’s eyes, we all died and rose with Him. Therefore, we can no longer 
live for ourselves, but for Him alone (5:15).
If you ask Christians, “Why did Christ die?”, the answer most of them 
would give is from 1 Corinthians 15:3, “Christ died for our sins.” That 
is right. But that is only part of the answer. The second part is here: 
“Christ died so that we should never again live for ourselves but for Him” 
(5:15). When we live for ourselves, we frustrate the purpose for which 
Christ died. If we keep living in sin, we are taking advantage of the fact 
that Christ died for our sins, and thus taking advantage of the grace of 
God. Any believer who lives for himself has not really understood the 
full purpose for which Christ died. Satan’s aim is to blind our eyes to 
the full truth of God. He first tries to prevent us from understanding 
anything at all about Christ’s death. If we do see that Christ died for 
our  sins,  then  Satan  will  try  to  blind  our  eyes  to  the  full  purpose  of  
Christ’s death.
Christ  died  to  deliver  us  permanently  from  a  self-centred  life.  When  
we put these two verses together – 1 Corinthians 15:3 and 2 Corinthians 
5:15 – we see that the root of all sin is self-centredness. A man lives in 
sin because he lives for himself. As long as you live for yourself, you will 
never have victory over sin. As long as the root of the tree has not been 
chopped off, it will keep on producing fruit. If you lay the axe to the root 
(self-centredness), then you won’t have to keep cutting off the evil fruit 
(sin) that comes forth.
Many  people  have  got  rid  of  sin  on  the  surface,  but  the  root  is  still  
there, the root of living for oneself. You will never get victory over sin as 
long as you live for yourself. You must decide once and for all, “From this 
day  onwards  I  will  never  make  a  decision  with  me  as  the  centre  of  my  
life. I will never make a decision based on how it will benefit me.” Do you 
know  the  number  of  people  who  make  decisions  in  Christian  work  by  
this question, “How will this benefit me? How will this benefit my family?” 
That is how every unconverted, godless sinner in the world also makes 
decisions. You are then no different from them except that he is proba-
bly an atheist whereas you go to some church. But inside you are both 
just the same. Jesus died to deliver us from that, so that we would never 
make a decision by how it would benefit us, but rather by how it would 
glorify God and benefit His kingdom and His purpose. If we can get 100 
people like that, we can turn India upside down. But it’s very difficult to 
find even a few like that.

726 Through the Bible: The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
2 Corinthians
The vast majority of Christians haven’t understood that we are not to 
live for ourselves any more. They skip over verses like 5:15 and jump 
to 5:17, “Old things are passed away and all things have become new – 
a new creation.” But let me ask you, “What are the old things that have 
passed away, or that should have passed away?” Has “living for self” 
passed away? Have your ambitions and your goals become new?
Ambassadors of the Universe’s Greatest Super-Power
In 5:20, we read, “We are ambassadors for Christ, and we are entreating 
you.” It is a tremendous calling to be an ambassador for Jesus Christ. 
There is a dignity about a true child of God. Even the ambassador of a 
very poor country has a dignity about him; and the bigger and the more 
powerful the country is, the more the dignified its ambassador will be. 
Think of the ambassador of USA in India. Can you imagine the dignity 
with which he conducts himself because he knows that he is represent-
ing the greatest super-power in the world. He won’t do anything cheap 
or undignified. He  won’t  go  asking  people  for  money,  and  he  won’t  do  
anything  that  dishonours  the  name  of  his  country.  Can  you  imagine  
the ambassador of USA coming to your house and asking you for some 
money for helping his country? 
Suppose a man dressed in a suit appears at your door (or on television) 
and says, “I am the ambassador of USA. We are in desperate need of 
some money in our country. Can you donate one hundred rupees for 
our work?” What will you say? You will say, “You are a deceiver. You 
are not the ambassador of USA. The ambassador of USA can never beg 
for money like that.”
Now suppose another man appears at your door (or on television) and 
says, “I am the ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are in desper-
ate  need  of  some  money  for  our  work.  Can  you  donate  one  hundred  
rupees  for  our  work?”  You  will  believe  him  and  give  him  the  money.  
Why? Because you believe that the ambassador of USA is a dignified 
man whereas the ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ is a beggar. 
There is only one super-power in the universe – and that is the kingdom 
of God Almighty. The USA ambassador may be representing the greatest 
super power on earth. But with all humility I can say I am an ambas-
sador  of  the  greatest  super  power  in  the  universe.  That’s  what  a  true  
disciple  of  Jesus  is.  Do  you  conduct  yourself  then  with  the  dignity  of  
such an ambassador? It grieves my heart when I see the Name of Jesus 
Christ dishonoured by the undignified, cheap way in which Christian 
workers beg for money on TV and in their church-meetings and through 
prayer-letters. In Psalm 50:12, the Lord says, “If I were hungry I would 
not tell you, for the world is Mine, and all it contains.” That’s what a true 

Ambassadors of the Universe’s Greatest Super-Power                                                                      727
2 Corinthians
servant of God says too: “If I am hungry or needy, I won’t tell you. I will 
tell my Master in heaven, Who owns the whole earth.” 
An  ambassador  has  always  to  be  in  touch  with  his  homeland.  He  
cannot afford to be out of touch with his home country for even a single 
day. That is how we also are called to live. I long to see the day in India 
when we can see servants of God conducting themselves with the dignity 
of  an  ambassador  of  the  greatest  super  power  in  the  universe  –  even  
if  they  are  poor  and  are  riding  only  bicycles.  But  how  many  Christian  
workers have you met like that? Most Christian workers are just digni-
fied beggars, always asking people for money and going after the rich. 
That is a tragedy.
Always remember that you are an ambassador of Jesus Christ, wher-
ever you may go – when travelling in a train or a bus or anywhere.
In 6:3–10, Paul speaks about how he conducted himself as an ambas-
sador of Christ: “In nothing giving offence to anyone so that the ministry 
does not get a bad name. But in everything commending myself by endur-
ance in affliction, hardship, distress, beatings, imprisonments, labour, 
sleeplessness  and  hunger;  conducting  myself  at  all  times  in  purity,  
patience  and  kindness. Sometimes  we  receive  glory  from  others,  some-
times  dishonour.  Some  people  appreciate  us,  others  condemn  us.  Some  
say good things about us, others speak evil about us. But in everything 
we  commend  ourselves  as  ambassadors  of  Jesus  Christ.  Some  call  us  
deceivers,  while  others  call  us  true  servants  of  God.  We  are  unknown  
in  the  world  but  well-known  among  God’s  people.  As  dying,  we  live.  
We  go  through  many  sufferings  but  we  know  we  won’t  die  until  God’s  
time comes. We are disciplined by God, but we aren’t dead yet. We are 
often sorrowful, not because people are hurting us, but because we are 
concerned for so many who are lost in sin, and so many believers who 
are carnal. But yet we are always rejoicing because our joy is in the Lord. 
We are poor materially, but we are making many rich spiritually. We have 
nothing in one sense, yet we possess all things in another sense, because 
we possess all of heaven and earth. Everything is at our disposal. God 
provides us with everything that we need. In terms of a bank account we 
may not have much. We often live from day to day. But God takes care of 
us.” That was how Paul lived. He never believed in the ‘prosperity gospel’.
The Corinthians were narrow hearted towards Paul. But Paul’s heart 
was wide open to them (6:11). This is a very important quality for every 
servant of God. Our hearts must always be wide open to others, even if 
they are narrow-hearted towards us. As Edward Markham’s poem says,
“He drew a circle that shut me out –
‘Heretic, rebel’, a thing to flout.
But Love and I had the wit to win:
We drew a circle that took him in.”

728 Through the Bible: The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
2 Corinthians
When  others  exclude  us  from  their  circle,  let  us  have  the  wisdom  to  
draw a bigger circle that includes them as well. Paul’s heart was large. 
You cannot serve God if your heart is open only towards those in your 
own church, or only towards Christians who agree with you in everything. 
Your  service  for  God  will  be  severely  limited  if  your  heart  is  not  open  
towards all of God’s people.
In 6:14,  we  are  given  a  warning  not  to  be  unequally  yoked  together  
with unbelievers. There was a law in the Old Testament that an ox and 
a  donkey  should  not  be  yoked  together  (Deuteronomy  22:10).  We  must  
not be partners in business with unbelievers – because they may want 
to cheat or do some other unrighteous things that you can’t agree with. 
In Christian work too, we cannot work with those who don’t have your 
sense  of  values.  And  if  you  marry  someone  who  is  not  a  believer  and  
who does not have your sense of values, and your vision and your ambi-
tions, it will be an unequal yoke. Righteousness has no partnership with 
lawlessness and light cannot fellowship with darkness.
So we are commanded to separate from all such alliances. “Therefore, 
come  out  from  their  midst  and  be  separate”  (6:17).  We  mingle  with  
 unbelievers in the world but we cannot become partners with them.
I want to speak plainly here. There are believers in some denominational 
churches who know that their leaders and bishops are unconverted. Why 
do they stay in such a church then? If the leader is not born again, the 
Bible calls him “a child of the devil” (1 John 3:10) – even if he is an arch-
bishop! How can you submit to a leader who is a child of the devil?
The Bible says that there are only two categories of people in the world 
– children of God and children of the devil (1 John 3:10)? Many believers 
don’t believe that. And so they compromise. Maybe you know that your 
pastor  is  a  crook  who  is  only  out  to  make  money.  What  then  are  you  
doing submitting to such a pastor?
Jesus  said,  “When  a  blind  man  leads  blind  people,  they  will  both  fall  
into a pit” (Matthew 15:14). If you want to avoid the pit, then don’t follow 
a  blind  leader.  God  says,  “Do not be bound together with unbelievers...
Come out from their midst and be separate.... Do not touch what is unclean 
... and I will be a Father to you” (2 Corinthians 6:14–18). You will never 
regret obeying those commands.
In 7:1, Paul goes on to say, “Therefore, having these promises, beloved, 
let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting 
holiness in the fear of God”. If you want to perfect holiness in your life, you 
have to cleanse yourself from ALL filthiness of flesh and spirit. There is 
external filthiness of associations that defile you, and internal filthiness 
of motives and attitudes. This is not an area where we ask God to cleanse 
us.  We  have  to  cleanse  ourselves  –  continuously.  And  we  must  do  this  
in the fear of God and not in the fear of men. In other words, we do not

2 Corinthians
cleanse ourselves before the eyes of men, but before the eyes of God. And 
we  must  not  seek  to  please  men  –  either  our  relatives  or  our  brothers.  
We must seek to please only God. Thus our holiness will be perfected.
In 7:2, Paul says, “I have a lot of room in my heart for you. Please make 
some room in your heart for me as well. I have never taken advantage of 
you. I have never wronged you. I have never corrupted any of you.” This 
is the testimony that every servant of the Lord should have.
In 7:10,  11,  Paul  refers  to  the  very  strong  rebuke  that  he  had  given  
them in his first letter. He had asked them to put a man out of the church 
(who was living in sin). The church at Corinth took that letter very seri-
ously. Paul caused them sorrow by his letter (verse 8). Sometimes God’s 
servants have to speak so strongly to us that it will cause us sorrow. But 
such sorrow will last only for a little while. Sorrow that is according to the 
will of God will produce a repentance that will lead to salvation (verse 10). 
And true repentance will always bring an earnestness and a zeal for God.
Money and God
In Chapters 8 and 9, Paul writes to them to collect some money for the 
poor saints in Jerusalem. Notice that he was not telling them to collect 
money  for  his  ministry.  Some  people  use  this  passage  to  say  that  Paul  
wrote to people to collect money. But Paul did not ask people to collect 
money for his ministry. He was not going to touch one cent of that money 
himself.  It  is  perfectly  in  order  to  ask  rich  believers  to  give  money  to  
help  poor  believers,  so  long  as  we  don’t  take  any  part  of  that  money  
ourselves. That was the example of the apostle Paul. He never touched 
a  cent  for  himself.  He  trusted  God  for  his  needs.  When  he  didn’t  have  
enough money, he stitched tents and earned something. Sometimes he 
went  without  food.  But  he  would  not  lower  his  standards.  He  was  an  
ambassador of the universe’s greatest superpower, and if he was hungry 
he was not going to tell anyone except God about it.
Every servant of God should have his eyes open to see where believers 
are poor and he should urge the rich believers (who are under his charge) 
to  help  them.  In  the  New  Testament,  we  never  read  of  Jesus,  or  any  
apostle or servant of God asking people to give them money for their own 
ministry. They told only God about their personal needs and the needs 
of their ministry. They urged believers only to help other poor believers.
Paul then gives the example of Jesus “You know the grace of our Lord 
Jesus Christ that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, 
so that you through His poverty might become rich” (8:9). 
Our Lord had everything in heaven. But He came down to earth and 
became poor. He hung on the cross, stripped of everything, so that we 
could  become  rich.  Is  Paul  saying  that  therefore  we  should  all  become  

730 Through the Bible: The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
2 Corinthians
wealthy  –  as  some  would  interpret  that  verse?  Not  at  all.  He  is  saying,  
first of all, how we have become spiritually wealthy through what Jesus 
did for us. Secondly, Paul is urging us to follow Christ’s example: “Look 
at  the  example  of  Jesus.  He  gave  up  everything  for  the  sake  of  others.  
You are His disciples and should be walking in His footsteps. If you are 
rich, you should be helping your fellow-believers who are poor.” That is 
the context of the whole chapter. But many money-loving preachers have 
misinterpreted this verse and encouraged other equally covetous believ-
ers to pursue after wealth.
It  is  very  easy  to  take  a  verse  of  Scripture  and  misquote  it  for  one’s  
own benefit. You can justify the hoarding of your money for yourself by 
saying, “Jesus became poor so that I might become rich.” That is how 
the prosperity-gospel cult has grown in numbers.
In 8:20, 21, Paul says that in distributing this money to the poor, he 
wants to be careful that he does it in a transparent way, so that no-one 
can accuse him of being unrighteous. We must have a great regard for 
what is honourable, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of 
men. Paul was careful to ensure that he and his co-workers should not 
be accused of having taken some of the money for themselves. So Paul 
sent Titus and another brother to transport the money to the church in 
Jerusalem  (verse  18). It  is  important  when  dealing  with  money  in  the  
church that at least two believers who have a good testimony handle it.
In 9:6, Paul again talks about the subject of giving. He says that if we 
are miserly in our giving, we will reap proportionately too. If you sow just 
a  little  bit  of  seed,  you  will  get  only  a  small  harvest.  If  you  sow  plenty  
of  seed  then  you  will  get  a  big  harvest.  Many  money-loving  preachers  
(especially television evangelists) have used this verse to urge believers to 
give them money. Such preachers are hucksters who are out to deceive 
simple believers. What did Jesus tell the rich young ruler who came to 
Him?  He  told  him  to  give  all  his  money  away  to  the  poor  and  to  come  
and follow Him without his money!! Jesus did not say (as most of today’s 
preachers would), “Sell what you have and give me the money, because 
we have many needs in our ministry. I have to support 12 disciples and 
their families.” Jesus wanted the man and not His money.
But where can we find servants of the Lord today, who will tell a rich 
person,  “We  are  not  one  bit  interested  in  your  money.  We  only  want  
to you  to  grow  spiritually.  So  give  your  money  to  whomever  you  like  
and come and hear the Word of God in our church”? We however, say 
exactly that to the visitors who come to our church – constantly.
In 9:7, we read that “God loves a cheerful giver.” Under the old coven-
ant, the emphasis was on how much one gave – 10% plus other offerings.  

Our Thought Life and Devotion to Christ                                                                                              731
2 Corinthians
Under  the  new  covenant  however,  the  emphasis  is  on  how  one  gave  
–  cheerfully  or  reluctantly.  The  question  now  is  not  one  of  quantity  of  
giving, but of quality of giving. Under the new covenant, quality alone is 
emphasised – even in the type of church one builds. 
Many believers are spiritually poor because they are miserly and tight-
fisted towards God. Be large-hearted and rich in your giving to God 
– first of all with your life and then with your time and your posses-
sions as well. And you will find that God repays you a hundredfold.
When I was single, I did not have many expenses, and I gave to God’s 
work most of my income from the Navy. When I got married later, I found 
I had many financial needs. But I never got into debt even once. I never 
had to borrow money from anyone at any time, because God took care 
of us and repaid what I had given Him earlier. So I can tell you from my 
experience: 
Learn to give richly to God – and you will find your financial problems 
solved. But let me warn you to give wisely. Don’t give money to preach-
ers who ask you for money. And don’t ever give to preachers who spend 
lavishly. They will waste your money. Pray and seek God’s will and give 
where God shows you that the need is the greatest. Give to the poor and 
not to the rich. Give to those who are really in need. You will then find 
that God gives you a rich harvest at the time of your need. It cannot be 
the will of God that any of His children should ever be in debt or face 
constant financial problems – when they have such a rich Father in 
heaven. The reason why many believers face such problems is because 
they have never been rich towards God. We reap what we sow.
Paul was a great apostle and these Corinthian Christians were young 
believers. Yet he humbled himself before them when he wrote these words 
to them in 10:1, “I urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ.” 
That was the spirit in which he spoke.
Our Thought Life and Devotion to Christ
He  goes  on  to  speak  about  the  “fortresses  that  there  are  in  our  thought  
life” (verse 5). The lusts in our flesh have built dirty thought-patterns and 
selfish thought-pattern, which are like strong fortresses. They make us 
live selfishly during the day, satisfying our own lusts. And at night, when 
we are asleep, dirty thoughts come out of these fortresses, as dreams. Is 
it God’s will that we should live like this forever? No. God’s will is that we 
bring every thought to the obedience of Christ. With spiritual weapons 
given to us by God, we can destroy these fortresses. One of those great 
weapons is the word of God which is powerful for the destruction of these 

732 Through the Bible: The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
2 Corinthians
fortresses (verse 4). Thus we can bring “every thought captive to the obedi-
ence of Christ.”
As we fill our minds more and more with the word of God, we will 
find that these fortresses get demolished one by one – and the soldiers 
(thoughts)  inside  these  fortresses  also  get  destroyed.  As  a  young  man,  
I  too have struggled with dirty thoughts, like all of you. This was the solu-
tion that I found in my younger days. I read, meditated and flooded my 
mind with God’s word. Our mind is like a bowl full of dirty water, because 
we have put a lot of muck and rubbish into it in our unconverted days. 
But if we pour a jug of clean water into that bowl, gradually that water 
overflows and gets diluted. Thus the water in the bowl becomes clearer 
and clearer. This will take a long time. But pouring God’s word into our 
mind can clean up our minds slowly, over a period of years. But if every 
now and then we throw a little muck into that bowl again, then the clean-
ing process gets delayed. We can ask God to give us grace to bring every 
thought of ours captive to the obedience of Christ.
In 10:13, Paul speaks about “not boasting beyond our measure.” He says, 
“God has appointed a certain sphere for my ministry, and I don’t have any 
desire to go outside that sphere.” For our Lord Jesus, in His earthly days, 
that  sphere  was  mostly  only  within  the  boundaries  of  Israel.  He  rarely  
ever went outside Israel. Paul too had a sphere of ministry apportioned 
by God. So Paul was not in competition with Peter, Andrew, Matthew, or 
with anyone else. He would work only in the sphere apportioned by God to 
him. Paul had a clear understanding about the boundaries of that sphere. 
Many preachers today, however, don’t have a clear understanding of their 
boundaries. That is why they clash and compete with other preachers.
Paul’s Trials and Thorn
In 11:2, 3, Paul speaks about how he wants to present those Corinthian 
Christians  as  a  pure  virgin  to  the  Lord  on  the  day  of  “the  marriage  of  
the Lamb”. And so he was very jealous that they should not fall in love 
with anyone else along the way. Consider the story of Abraham’s servant 
Eliezer, taking Rebecca on a long journey (of about 1500 kilometres from 
Ur to Canaan) to present her to Isaac. On that journey, if any handsome 
young men had come and tried to win Rebecca’s affection, Eliezer would 
have warned Rebekah saying, “Don’t be attracted by these men. I have 
to  present  you  as  a  pure  virgin  to  Isaac.”  Paul  wanted  to  preserve  the  
church in Corinth in the same way for Jesus. That is the holy jealousy 
that every servant of God must have for his flock. He must tell them, “You 
are reserved for Jesus. Don’t be attracted by money, illegitimate sex, or 
worldly honour. These will try to attract you. But you must resist their 
advances and keep yourself pure.” Then Paul goes on to say, “I fear that 
Satan will come like he did to Eve in Eden, and draw your hearts away 
from that simple and pure devotion to Christ.”

Paul’s Trials and Thorn                                                                                                                             733
2 Corinthians
When does anyone become a backslider or go astray? Is it when they 
start believing some false doctrine or when they join a cult? According 
to 11:3, we go astray the moment we lose our devotion to Christ. Every 
believer  who  has  lost  his  devotion  to  Christ  has  already  gone  astray. 
Our job as shepherds of God’s flock is to preserve the sheep in devotion 
to Jesus Christ. That is the most important thing in the Christian life. 
The  devil  perpetually  seeks  to  lead  believers  astray  from  loving  Jesus  
fervently. It  is  no  use  engaging  in  evangelism  or  teaching  or  any  other  
service for the Lord, if we have lost our fervent love for Christ. This was 
the  Lord’s  only  complaint  against  the  messenger  and  the  church  at  
Ephesus (Revelation 2:4).
Paul goes on to say that he was not a financial burden to any of the 
Christians  there:  “When  I  was  present  with  you  I  was  not  a  burden  
to  anyone”  (11:5–13).  He  worked  with  his  hands  as  a  tentmaker  and  
supported  himself  and  his  coworkers.  He  did,  however,  occasionally,  
accept  gifts  from  the  church  at  Philippi  (11:8,  9).  Why  did  he  make  
this  distinction?  Because  many  believers  in  Corinth  did  not  accept  his  
apostle  ship  or  his  ministry.  As  servants  of  God,  we  must  never  accept  
any  money  from  people  or  churches  who  do  not  accept  our  ministry.  
We have a dignity as ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ. Accepting 
money from any believer is an act of fellowship. So there is nothing wrong 
in receiving money from someone who has accepted your ministry. But 
not otherwise.
In 11:23–33, Paul speaks about the varied trials that he had experi-
enced in his service for the Lord – his imprisonments, the beatings he 
had received both with scourges and with rods, sleepless nights, hunger 
and thirst, exposure to inclement weather, dangers from robbers, etc. 
There were times when he did not have enough warm clothing to cover 
himself, or even enough food to eat; and he did not have the money to 
buy warm clothes and food at that time. God took him through all this 
to make him a mini-forerunner for other Christians who were suffer-
ing. In each of those trials, Paul humbled himself. He says, “Once I was 
going to be captured in Damascus and the believers had to lower me in 
a basket through a window for me to escape capture” (11:32, 33). If you 
were an apostle, and something as humiliating as that had happened 
to  you,  you  may  not  want  anyone  to  hear  about  it.  But  Paul  did  not  
want  the  Corinthian  Christians  to  imagine  that  he  was  a  great  man  
whom God would send some angels to rescue. He was an ordinary man 
and  he  wanted  others  to  know  him  as  such.  “I  don’t  want  anyone  to  
think more highly of me than he should”, he said (2 Corinthians 12:6 - 
Living). How different Paul was from most servants of the Lord today 
who try to give others a higher impression about themselves than they 
actually are.
In 12:1, Paul speaks about a time when he was taken up by the Lord 
to the third heaven. For 14 years he had never mentioned it to anyone. 

734 Through the Bible: The Treasure in an Earthen Vessel
2 Corinthians
What a man he was! He had kept quiet about this experience for 14 years 
– and even when he did speak about it, he gave no details whatsoever. 
Most believers would have spoken about such a vision in the very next 
meeting  of  the  church  –  and  given  every  detail  about  it!  This  is  why  I  
believe Paul’s experience was genuine. The visions of heaven that some 
believers boast about these days are figments of their fertile imagination 
– spoken in order to get honour from others! Why do I say that? Because 
those who have genuine visions will find that those visions are (as Paul 
said) “so astounding that they are beyond a man’s power to describe or 
put in words” and they will “not be allowed to tell them to others” (12:4).
Then  Paul  spoke  about  a  heavy  trial  that  he  had  that  God  did  not  
remove, even after persistent prayer. Paul called it “a thorn in the flesh” 
and “a messenger of Satan” – yet it had been “given by God” (12:7). The 
gift God gave Paul was a thorn!! God gave it to Paul because He saw Paul 
in danger of becoming proud. God resists all proud people, but He didn’t 
want to resist Paul. He wanted to give him grace. But He could give Paul 
grace only if he remained humble (1 Peter 5:5). So God allowed Satan’s 
messenger to harass Paul and thus kept him constantly dependent on 
God and humble.
So we see that, at times, God may permit even a messenger of Satan to 
keep on harassing us, with a good end in view. Sickness, for example, 
is  a  messenger  of  Satan.  Why  do  we  say  that?  Because  Jesus  said,  
“If  you,  being  evil,  know  how  to  give  good  gifts  to  your  children,  how  
much more will your Father in heaven give (only) what is good to those 
who ask Him” (Matthew 7:11). We are all evil fathers when compared 
to God, Who is perfectly good. And none of us would ever give sickness 
to our children. Then how could a loving, heavenly Father give sick-
ness to any of His children? Most of the sicknesses in the world come 
because  the  earth  is  under  a  curse  (Genesis  3:17).  Some  other  sick-
nesses are caused by Satan (Job 2:7). Even though God’s perfect will 
for us is to be healthy, He may still permit us to be sick at times, with 
a purpose. When Paul prayed for deliverance from the thorn, God did 
not deliver him but gave him grace instead, to be an overcomer in spite 
of the thorn. We can be overcomers too with that same grace.
In 13:4  and  5,  we  read,  “Jesus was crucified in weakness, yet He 
lives by the power of God. We also are weak in Him, yet we will live with 
Him because of the power of God.” A true disciple is one who is weak in 
himself and who lives by God’s power. And that is how Paul concludes 
the epistle.

Twelve Marks of an Ambassador of Jesus Christ                                                                                 735
2 Corinthians
Twelve Marks of an Ambassador of Jesus Christ
In  conclusion,  let  us  look  at  12  marks  of  “an  ambassador  of  Jesus  
Christ” that we see in this epistle.
Paul was an ambassador of Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:20).
1. He  was  called  by  God  (1:1).  “An  apostle  of  Jesus  Christ  by  the  
will of God.” He did not call himself. God called him. This is very 
important.  We  must  not  enter  full-time  ministry  if  God  has  not  
called us.
2. He was utterly sincere (1:12). One of the most important things God 
requires from us is sincerity. You may have many weaknesses, but 
if you are honest and sincere, you can be a true servant of God.
3. He was anointed by the Holy Spirit (1:22). Whatever other qualifi-
cations you may have, if you are not anointed with the Holy Spirit, 
you  will  not  be  able  to  serve  God.  You  might  as  well  go  and  do  
something else.
4. He loved those whom he served (2:4). “I want you to know the love 
I have especially for you.”
5. He depended totally on God (3:5). “Our sufficiency is from God.” He 
did not depend on his human abilities or on influential people. 
He depended on God alone.
6. He  never  gave  up  (4:1).  “Since  we  have  this  ministry  we  don’t  
lose heart. We never give up.” In Christian work, we can often be 
tempted to give up. We must resist that temptation just like any 
other.
7. He was an example to other people (6:3, 4). “In everything commend-
ing  ourselves  as  servants  of  God.”  He  was  an  example  in  his  
life-style and in the way he conducted himself in trying situations.
8. He never took advantage of anyone (7:2). He never made people his 
servants to serve him in any way. He never took advantage of the 
goodness of others, or of their hospitality.
9. He handled money wisely (8:20, 21; 11:9). He was not a financial 
burden on anyone. He was extremely careful in money-matters. He 
never received money from those who did not receive his ministry.
10. He stayed within the boundaries that God had drawn around him 
(10:13). He had no lust to go beyond those boundaries.
11. He  was  willing  to  suffer  (11:23–33).  He  had  many  sufferings  in  
serving the Lord and he accepted them all joyfully.
12. Finally: He longed to lead believers to perfection (13:9). “We rejoice 
when you are strong and we pray that you will be made perfect.”
This was the way Paul followed Christ. Let us follow his example and 
serve the Lord like he did.



GALATIANS
Freedom from the Law
‘F
reedom from the law’ is the subject of Galatians. Paul speaks here 
of another gospel contrary to the one the apostles preached (1:8). 
The  other  gospel  is  a  false  gospel  that  keeps  Christians  bound  
to the spirit of the law – trying to please God by keeping certain rules. 
Christians who want to be holy stand in great risk of becoming legalistic 
instead of living by the leading of the Holy Spirit. Church-elders can feel 
that if they preach too much on grace, then their people will live just as 
they like – and sin. So they introduce a few rules for membership in their 
church – rules that are not found in God’s Word – in order to control their 
people.  But  that  is  not God’s  way  –  because  that  always  brings  people  
into bondage. It is very important, therefore, to understand the difference 
between law and grace.
The Difference Between Law and Grace
The law could keep a person clean externally. The ten commandments 
could  be  likened  to  ten  chains  put  on  a  pig.  If  you  clean  up  a  pig  and  
then take it through a filthy area, it will come through clean, if you keep 
controlling it with those chains every time it wants to turn this way or that 
to wallow in the muck. The pig can boast that it is clean even after going 
through two kilometres of rubbish and muck. But it remained clean only 
because it was restrained by the chains. Any believer who is kept pure by 
the restraints of rules is under the law. Such a believer will be clean only 
externally. Inside, he will be unchanged, like the pig. On the other hand, 
if you were to send a cat through that two-kilometre stretch, it will come 
out clean – without any chains. It just avoids everything dirty. That is the 
difference between one who is under law and one who is under grace. It 
is a cat’s inward nature that makes it different from the pig. Grace makes 

738 Through the Bible: Freedom from the Law
Galatians
us partakers of the Divine nature. God does not want to control us with 
chains but to change our nature within.
In the first few verses of this letter, Paul talks about how these Christians 
had gone away from the gospel he had preached to them, to a legalistic 
gospel. And Paul relates that to a desire to please man. “Am I seeking to 
please men or God?” (1:10). Those who live under the law are invariably 
men-pleasers.  That  is  the  real  problem.  In  1:4,  Paul  says,  “Christ  gave  
Himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world,” 
and its opinion, approval, rules and regulations. He delivers us so that 
we might live according to the will of God. So Jesus died not only 
• to forgive our sins, and 
• that our old man might be crucified with Him, and 
• that Satan might be defeated on the cross, and
• that we might not live for ourselves, but for Him; 
but here is another reason why He died: 
• So that we might never be part of this world’s system. 
Have  you  understood  that?  Those  who  are  legalistic  usually  want  to  
live  in  this  world  system  as  Christians.  I  have  observed  that  legalistic  
Christians by and large, love money and are worldly. They are not worldly 
on  the  outside.  They  may  dress  simply,  but  they  are  worldly  in  their  
hearts  and  minds.  But  those  who  come  under  true  grace  become  free.  
Jesus died in order to deliver us from this world system.
Every  religion  in  the  world  has  rules  and  regulations.  No  religion  
preaches  free  forgiveness  without  our  having  to  do  anything.  Every  
religion teaches that we have to do something before God can forgive 
us and accept us. And whenever “Christianity” begins to preach some-
thing like that, you can be sure it is a false gospel.
A legalistic gospel seeks to please men and not God. Because the right-
eousness of the law is external, and we want an external righteousness 
in order to impress people that we are very holy. But the righteousness 
that comes through grace and from God is primarily inward. If we seek to 
please men, we will not care about our inside. Jesus said to the Pharisees, 
“You clean the outside of the cup, but the inside is dirty.” That is how it is 
for all who are legalistic. Their outside is clean, but their inside is dirty. 
Paul says here that if we truly want to be free from legalistic Christianity, 
then we must deal with the root-cause of it. We must decide once for all 
not to please men but to please God alone.
Galatians 1:10 is a very important verse for anyone who wants to serve 
the Lord: “If I seek to please men, I cannot be a servant of Christ”. This is 

The Ministry of Paul                                                                                                                                 739
Galatians
a  clear-cut  statement.  The  moment  you  seek  to  please  your  relatives,  
your colleagues, or your fellow-brethren, or any man – you cannot serve 
the Lord. In every decision you take and everything you do, you should 
therefore ask yourself, “Am I doing this to please men or to please God?” 
Believers  ask  many  questions,  such  as,  “Can  I  watch  this  television  
programme?”, “Can I wear ornaments?”, etc. To find the answer, all that 
they need to do is ask themselves, “Am I doing this to please myself/
others – or am I doing this to please God?” We don’t have to judge one 
another in this matter but only ourselves.
When it says here, ‘to please men’, it includes satisfying ourselves too. 
When we please ourselves we cannot please God. To be free from legal-
istic Christianity, we must decide once and for all, that whenever we are 
tempted to please ourselves or others, we will instead deny ourselves and 
seek to please God alone. Life will then become full of the joy of the Lord 
and we will be able to serve others in the power of the Holy Spirit.
The Ministry of Paul
Paul then goes on to defend his ministry. Remember that Paul was writing 
at a time when the New Testament was not written. A lot of the books in 
the New Testament were written after Paul died. So when Paul wrote this, 
there was no New Testament available in different places. Even after the 
New Testament was written there were only a few copies of it available. 
So Paul had to defend his apostleship, in exactly the same way that we 
today defend the authority of the Bible as the Word of God, to those who 
do not accept its authority. In the same way the apostles had to defend 
their apostleship, in those days, so that people would accept what they 
taught as the word of God. We don’t need to do that today, because we 
are not preaching our word, but the word of Scripture.
Paul was not quoting any Scripture when he said, “We are justified by 
faith in Christ.” There was no Old Testament verse that taught that, or 
that the law had been abolished. Paul was writing Scripture – and so he 
needed to defend his apostleship. And that was why God had to confirm 
his apostleship with signs, wonders and miracles in a way that is not 
needed today. That is why we do not see so many miracles today as Paul 
and Peter saw in their time. In the Acts of the Apostles, God confirmed 
the message of the gospel with miracles wherever it was being preached 
for the first time. And God is doing such miracles even today in remote 
areas where the gospel is being preached for the first time.
Paul  then  says  that  he  did  not  receive  the  gospel  from  man  (1:12), 
but by direct revelation from Christ. Once he had been very zealous for 
the law and had promoted it. But when God revealed His Son to Paul’s 
heart,  he  did  not  consult  with  man  but  went  straightaway  to  Arabia  

740 Through the Bible: Freedom from the Law
Galatians
and  then  went  to  Jerusalem  only  three  years  later  (1:16,  17).  First  of  
all he started out more zealously than all the people of his time. He was 
advancing  and  promoting  the  law  through  traditions  (1:14).  But  when  
Christ was revealed to him on the Damascus road, he went off to Arabia 
for three years.
Why did he go to Arabia for three years? He had spent three years in 
Gamaliel’s Bible school in Jerusalem, acquiring wrong ideas about God 
and about how one could be saved through the law. So it is possible that 
God took him away to the desert for three years to get all that chaff out 
of his head and to give him revelation on the new-covenant gospel. This 
is what God often has to do with people who go to Bible-school and get 
knowledge without the revelation of the Holy Spirit.
Gamaliel, as far as we know, was a God-fearing man (Acts 5:34–39). But 
he did not have the revelation of the Holy Spirit. So he could not lead 
the students in his Bible school into Divine truth. All he had was an 
intellectual knowledge of the law. So his student Paul had to be alone 
with God for three years before he could get the Spirit’s revelation. 
We have often looked at the word ‘revelation.’ We never see this word 
in  the  Old  Testament,  because  people  did  not  have  the  Holy  Spirit  
within  them  then.  Under  the  old  covenant,  the  emphasis  was  only  
on  ‘  meditation.’  If  we  meditate  on  the  Scriptures  but  don’t  get  reve-
lation from the Spirit, we can miss what God has for us. When Peter 
recognised Jesus as the Son of God, Jesus said to him, “Blessed are 
you because you got revelation” (Matthew 16:17). Paul says here that 
he  got  the  same  revelation  (1:16). It’s  important  when  studying  the  
Scriptures,  that  we  get  revelation  on  it  from  the  Holy  Spirit.  It’s  not  
enough  to  understand  it.  There  are  many  who  understand  the  Bible  
and  who  even  believe  what  is  written  therein.  The  devil  also  under-
stands and believes in that way. But that doesn’t change Satan. And 
it won’t change you. We can believe, understand and even memorise 
Scripture and yet remain unchanged.
You can know that you have received revelation on Scripture when it 
changes your life, your ambitions, your attitude toward money, your atti-
tude to your enemies and your attitude towards sin. But if these things 
have  not  happened,  then  all  your  knowledge  of  Scripture  is  no  better  
than  the  devil’s.  A very immoral person can be a first-class teacher of 
chemistry. In the same way, a very immoral person can be a first-class 
teacher of the Bible. If you have intelligence you can study the Bible just 
like people study chemistry. You can get a doctorate in chemistry or you 
can get a doctorate in the Bible. That is only a test of your intelligence. 
But  in  their  personal  life  the  chemistry  teacher  and  the  Bible  teacher  
may both be living immorally. Or both may be living to make money and

Galatians
have  many  earthly  ambitions.  Neither  of  them  have  any  Divine  revela-
tion. Revelation is something that will change our lives. That is what we 
need if we are to serve God.
In Christendom, we find people who have gone to two extremes. Some 
are  totally  intellectual  and  do  not  believe  in  revelation;  they  are  dead  
spiritually. Then there are others who believe in revelation but who have 
taken it to another extreme. They talk about special revelations that they 
have received, that are not in the Bible. These are extremists and cultists. 
The Gospel Brings Freedom
In Chapter 2, we read of how Paul defends the gospel of the grace of God, 
even before Peter. I want you to see something that Paul did here, that 
is an attitude that all of us should have. Here we see a healthy correc-
tive to the imbalance I just spoke about. Paul first went to Arabia, and 
then after 14 years he went to Jerusalem, because of a revelation (2:2). 
In Arabia he had received revelation on the mysteries of God. Then God 
gave him another revelation and told him to go to Jerusalem and submit 
this gospel he was now preaching privately to godly leaders in the church 
there – to check up whether he was teaching the truth or whether he was 
going off on a tangent. So Paul went to godly leaders in the church and 
asked them, “Brothers, this is the revelation I have received and that I 
am preaching. What do you think about it? What is your opinion about 
this revelation?”
Whenever you get some new revelation, I would encourage you to go to 
some older, godly brother or brothers and check up with them whether 
your revelation is Scriptural. There could be other aspects of Scripture 
that you are ignorant of and may not have considered. It is a safety for 
younger people to go to older people and confirm whether their revela-
tions are from God. That will save you from being imbalanced and will 
protect you from false teaching. 
In those days, there were false brothers who came into the church to 
spy out the liberty that people were having in Christ and preaching about 
and wanted to bring them into bondage again (2:4). Paul would not listen 
to them at all. And even the godly leaders of the church acknowledged 
that what Paul was preaching was right (2:6).
In those days, some Jewish Christians said, “You must be circumcised 
in order to be saved”. Today some church leaders say, “You must remove 
your jewellery before we will baptise you”, or “You must get rid of your 
television set before we will allow you to break bread with us”. Such legal-
ism  has  been  around  in  Christendom  for  centuries,  in  different  forms.  
Legalists have always sought to add something or the other to the simple 
message of repentance and faith in Christ for salvation. Church leaders 

742 Through the Bible: Freedom from the Law
Galatians
have added their own rules to the Scriptures through the centuries. And 
that is why many churches are in such a pathetic state today. 
When  God  accepts  someone,  He  doesn’t  check  whether  she  has  
removed her jewellery or whether he has got rid of his television set. He 
sees whether he has repented and believed in Christ. Further, God loves a 
cheerful giver of obedience and so He never forces anyone to do anything.
Are you adding something not found in the New Testament as neces-
sary  before  you  accept  a  brother  into  your  fellowship?  Theoretically  
people  may  say  it  is  only  repentance  and  faith  that  are  required.  But  
in  spite  of  saying  that,  when  it  comes  to  actually  welcoming  a  person  
into  the  church-fellowship,  church-leaders  will  say  something  else  is  
also  required.  There  are  just  as  many  traditions  of  the  elders  in  many  
of the so-called “New Testament” churches as there are in the mainline 
denominations. And to justify their actions, they will quote some verse 
out of context.
So the letter to the Galatians is very relevant for our time. Paul was a 
man  who  fought  for  the  freedom  of  the  gospel.  Every  true  servant  of  
God will fight for the freedom of the gospel. Are you in a church- system 
whose  top  leaders  believe  something  that  you  know  is  a  tradition?  
Those elders are bringing a whole lot of people into bondage through 
those traditions. 
How  many  are  there,  who  have  courage  like  Paul,  to  confront  such  
elders and to tell them that they are wrong. Paul confronted even Peter. 
“Peter came to Antioch, and I opposed him to the face” (2:11). Remember, 
Peter was the man who had publicly welcomed Paul recognising that he 
had a God-given ministry (2:9). Yet Paul confronted him.
There  is  something  wonderful  we  see  here  about  Peter,  James  and  
John. Paul  who  was  much  younger  than  them,  began  having  a  wider  
ministry than them – and they had the grace to recognise it and encour-
age him in it. It is very rare to find older servants of God like that today, 
who have the grace to recognise an anointing upon a younger brother. 
Paul then confronts Peter, the senior leader of the church, and tells him 
that he is wrong. That would be like a junior worker confronting the top 
leader of his denomination and saying, “You are wrong.”
Why are there so few like Paul? Because most Christians are diplomatic 
and seek to please men. They mistake their compromising attitude for 
gentleness and humility. When it comes to the truth of the gospel, we 
must  not  seek  our  reputation.  Truth  is  not  our  property.  It  is  God’s  
and  so  we  have  to  defend  it. Most Christians would fight tooth and 
nail for their earthly property. But when it comes to God’s property – 
the truth – that is being stolen, most Christians just keep quiet. That 
proves that they just love themselves. They don’t love God or the truth.

Faith – Not Works                                                                                                                                     743
Galatians
But Paul loved the truth. If someone was only stealing Paul’s coat or 
shirt,  he  would  have  let  him  have  it.  But  when  they  were  robbing  the  
truth of God’s word, he fought for the truth. That is how every godly man 
is. He cares more for God’s truth than for his own property.
If all of you had valued God’s truth as much as you value your own 
property, you might have progressed much further than you have. I find 
there are very few people who are willing to take a stand for the truth. Most 
preachers  are  men-pleasers.  So  God  cannot  make  them  His  prophets.  
God will test you in many different circumstances to see whom you want 
to please. God tested Paul here to see if he would seek to please Peter.
Peter was a senior apostle, but what he was doing was wrong (2:12). He 
used to eat with the Gentiles. But when some people came from James 
(the elder at Jerusalem), he became afraid of what James would think 
and withdrew. That was when Paul stood up to Peter. Even Barnabas 
was carried away by Peter’s hypocrisy (2:13). Barnabas also was senior 
to Paul. He was a gentle, gracious person. His attitude may have been, 
“Brother Peter is a senior brother. So let me not say anything and judge 
this godly man.” Paul’s attitude, however, was, “It’s not a question of 
whether he is more godly. I am not comparing myself with him. What 
he is doing is contrary to the gospel message that we are preaching. 
What’s  wrong  with  eating  food  with  the  Gentiles?  Why  should  we  be  
afraid of what Brother James has to say?”
Are you afraid like that of some elder brother’s opinion? It was because 
there were brave, fearless men like Paul in the first century that we have 
the pure gospel in the New Testament. Because there were fearless men 
in all these 20 centuries, who stood for the truth of the gospel, and did 
not seek to please men, we have the pure gospel message today. Thank 
God for such men.
In 2:20, we see the secret of Paul’s life and how he had the courage to 
stand for the truth. He was “crucified with Christ.” The old Paul had died. 
Christ was living in him now. Many Christians have understood only one 
side of the way of the cross – the negative side of it – death to Self. But 
there’s  another  glorious  side  to  it  –  “Christ  lives  in  me.”  Death  to  Self  
leads to the resurrection-life of Christ. Then His life can be manifested 
through us.
Faith – Not Works
In Chapter 3, Paul speaks about the basis on which we receive the Holy 
Spirit – not works, but faith. He asks them, “Did you receive the Spirit by 
the works of the law?” (3:2). Some people imagine that God will give them 
the fullness of the Holy Spirit if they fast and pray sufficiently. 

744 Through the Bible: Freedom from the Law
Galatians
But did you get forgiveness of your sins because you fasted and prayed? 
No. It was a gift. Forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit are 
both given exactly on the same basis: By grace, without works. 
Paul  then  asks  the  Galatians,  “If  you  started  your  Christian  life  by  
faith, do you think that you can now perfect it by fleshly efforts?” It was 
the Holy Spirit Who brought salvation into your life, and He is the One 
Who will make you holy as well. It is not laws, rules and regulations that 
will  make  you  holy.  If  you  have  understood  this  truth,  then  you  have  
understood the main message in the letter to the Galatians.
You did not receive the Spirit by the works of the law. Perfection does 
not come by the works of the flesh, but by the work of the Holy Spirit. You 
have to submit to the Holy Spirit, listen to His voice whenever He convicts 
you,  and  set  matters  right.  Thus  He  will  keep  you  holy.  Fasting  and  
prayer  won’t  make  anyone  holy.  Many  who  fast  and  pray  regularly  are  
still defeated by sin – they quarrel with others and lust in their hearts. 
This proves that holiness does not come that way. It is only by the power 
of the Holy Spirit.
Then Paul reminds them that the miracles God worked among them 
were  also  not  as  a  result  of  their  works  (3:5).  They  were  in  response  
to their faith. God does amazing supernatural works for His children – 
not because they deserve it or because of any good works they did, but 
because of their faith.
Abraham was justified by faith (3:6); and then he was made a blessing 
to all nations (3:8). And so can we be (3:14). When Christ hung on the 
cross, He became a curse for us (3:13), to remove the curse of the law 
from us. There is a curse in the law: If you don’t live according to its 
standard, you are cursed. Deuteronomy 28 lists some of these curses 
– madness, blindness, and many sicknesses. Christ took away those 
curses  when  He  died  on  the  cross.  This  teaches  us  that  we  cannot  
suffer because of any sins committed by our ancestors – because every 
curse was broken at the cross. When we received Christ as our Lord, 
every curse was broken. We don’t have to live in fear of any generational 
curse  now.  Instead  we  have  the  opposite  –  the  blessing  of  Abraham  
(3:14). That is why we can now receive the Holy Spirit through faith.
The blessing given by God to Abraham was: “All nations and all fami-
lies  on  earth  will  be  blessed  through  you”  (3:8).  So  the  purpose  of  the  
Holy Spirit coming into our lives is to make us a blessing to every person 
we  meet.  One mark of a Spirit-filled person is that he is a blessing to 
everybody he meets. When he visits a home, he blesses that home. Many 
Christians,  when  they  visit  a  home,  bring  confusion  into  that  home.  
Many  cultists  bring  division  and  many  other  problems  into  Christian  
homes. But a godly person brings a blessing. When one person in a home 
gets converted, there can be some disturbance in that home. But as time 

Justification and Sanctification                                                                                                               745
Galatians
passes,  the  blessing  of  God  will  come  into  that  home;  and  more  of  the  
members of that home will be converted. This is the blessing of Abraham 
that we are called to partake of.
Justification and Sanctification
In the rest of Chapter 3, we read about the difference between law and 
grace.  The  above  promise  was  given  to  Abraham  400  years  before  the  
law. In 3:24, we are told that “the law is like a child-trainer (or nanny) that 
leads us to Christ.” One function of the law was to show us that no matter 
how  holy  a  man  was,  he  could  never  rise  up  to  God’s  standard.  Pass  
marks in God’s kingdom is 100%. The best among us get 0%!! For 1500 
years, the Israelites tried to keep the law, but failed repeatedly. They were 
like the disciples who went fishing and caught NO fish (0%) the whole 
night (John 21). Finally, they looked to the Lord and He filled their boat 
with fish (100%) in a moment. 
When we come to Christ, He adds His 100% to us immediately – and 
thus we are justified. Justification is like receiving grace marks in an 
examination. We all get 0% by God’s standards. But God offers us all 
100  grace  marks.  Those  who  accept  the  offer  get  100%.  Those  who  
refuse,  have  to  live  with  their  0%.  Thus,  those  who  accept  the  100  
grace marks go ahead of all the others, even though they may be worse 
students!! This is the gospel of justification by faith. The righteous-
ness of Christ is put to our account. We humbly acknowledge that we 
deserve only zero. Thus all the glory for our salvation goes to God alone.
 God doesn’t leave us there – merely justified. He wants to sanctify us 
entirely too. And so the righteousness of Christ that was imputed to 
us, He then imparts to us, day by day, through the Holy Spirit, so that 
it becomes a part of our own nature. Thus we press on to perfection. 
That essentially is the message of Galatians. It doesn’t make a differ-
ence who you are – “you are all sons of God” (3:26). Nobody is better than 
another in Christ’s Body. There is no Jew or Greek, free man or slave, 
male  or  female  in  the  Body.  All  are  equally  accepted  by  God.  And  we  
must accept all people equally, once they have come to Christ. If you look 
down on someone of another community, you haven’t really understood 
justification in Christ. You are back under the law again. The law divides 
people into communities. Justification by grace unites us.
One  indication  that  you  are  free  from  the  law  is  this,  that  you  can  
sincerely look at every person in Christ irrespective of language, commu-
nity, education or background and say, “He is my brother. She is my 
sister.  I  can  have  fellowship  with  them  no  matter  what  background  

746 Through the Bible: Freedom from the Law
Galatians
they come from. They are all the same to me, because all our differ-
ences have been eliminated in Christ.”
In Chapter 4, the difference is pointed out between being a child and 
an adult son. Under the law, God treated the Israelites as small child-
ren. There is no difference between a child and a slave because a child 
can’t really exercise ownership of anything, even if he owns everything 
(4:1). But when the child becomes an adult son, then he can exercise his 
ownership  of  everything.  This  is  the  difference  between  law  and  grace.  
Under the law God treated people like little children. Under grace, we are 
treated like adult sons. 
Under the law, God had to give the Israelites laws for every little thing. 
They were told, for example, what to do with a pot if a lizard fell into it, 
and what to do if they found a mother-bird along with its little ones in a 
nest, and how to handle various types of skin disease, etc. That is how we 
deal with little children. We have to tell them to wake up at a certain time, 
brush their teeth, pack their books, go to school, do their homework, etc. 
We have to hold their hands and teach them to look left and right before 
crossing a busy road. We have to teach a child every little thing. But you 
don’t have to remind an adult to brush his teeth in the morning, or to go 
to school. You would teach an adult son good principles to live by. That’s 
another difference between law and grace. Under the new covenant, you 
find principles and not detailed rules. When Christians take those prin-
ciples and make detailed rules out of them, they become Pharisees. You 
find such Christians in every denomination in Christianity. The tendency 
towards Phariseeism is in every group. Leaders prefer to make rules for 
their  flock  rather  than  teach  them  divine  principles.  Thus  they  bring 
people  back  under  the  law.  They  treat  people  like  children  when  God  
wants  to  treat  them  as  adults.  If  God  wants  to  treat  His  children  as  
adults, we better learn to treat them as adults too!
In 4:13, Paul tells us that he preached in Galatia for the first time 
because he was sick. He didn’t plan to stay in Galatia initially, but only to 
pass through. But he fell sick, and because of that he had to stay put in 
Galatia and while he was in that region, he preached the gospel to people 
there,  and  churches  were  established.  Thus  we  see  that  the  sickness  
that the devil gave Paul only served to fulfil God’s purposes. If Paul had 
not been sick, he would not have stayed in Galatia and then there would 
have  been  no  churches  planted  there.  In  Acts  16:6,  we  read  that  Paul  
and his team went through Galatia and were “forbidden by the Holy Spirit 
to travel to Asia Minor”. It is only when we read Galatians 4:13, that we 
discover that the way the Spirit stopped him in Galatia was through sick-
ness!!  As  the  old  saying  goes,  “Disappointments  are  His  appointments.” 
If you are a wholehearted child of God, every disappointment will become 
God’s  appointment  for  you.  God  still  works  in  amazing  ways  through  
sicknesses, delayed trains, missed buses, and other delays.

A Life Led By the Spirit                                                                                                                             747
Galatians
In 4:19, Paul compares himself to a mother going into labour to deliver 
a child. He is referring to the burden he has in his heart that the image 
of Christ should be formed in the Galatians. If you have seen a photo-
graph of an embryo in its mother’s womb, you would have noticed that 
it looks more like a tadpole than a human being, with a big head and a 
small body that looks like a tail. But after nine months it comes out of the 
womb as a perfectly shaped baby. Paul is saying here, “You Christians 
are like that embryo. You don’t look like Christ at all. The Divine seed is 
there in you, but everything is out of proportion. So I am burdened for 
you, that the image of Christ should be formed in you, so that you are 
perfectly proportioned in every area of your life.” That is the burden that 
every true servant of God carries in his heart for his flock.
A Life Led By the Spirit
In 5:1,  Paul  says  that  Christ  came  to  set  us  free.  So  we  should  never  
permit  anyone  to  bring  us  into  bondage  to  laws  again.  We  must  never  
become slaves to the traditions and laws made by any group or church. 
At  the  same  time,  we  must  not  use  our  freedom  as  an  excuse  to  sin  
(5:13). Many believers have misunderstood grace and Christian freedom 
and  ended  up  worse  than  being  under  the  law  –  they  live  as  slaves  to  
their flesh. The only right way to be free from the law is to be led by the 
Holy Spirit. Otherwise we will sink lower than the law and live in sin. But 
if we walk according to the leading of the Spirit, then we will not descend 
to the level of the flesh. Only such believers can claim to be free from the 
law (5:16, 18). So there are three levels at which a believer can live:
1. Led by the Spirit (the highest – new covenant – level); or
2. Led by the law (the old covenant level); or 
3. Led by the flesh (the lowest level).
Look at these three levels of life as the three floors of a building. If you are 
not living on the third floor (led by the Spirit), and you destroy the second 
floor (led by the law), you will descend to the first floor (led by the flesh). 
If you say, “I am not led by the law because Jesus has abolished the law,” 
then you better be led by the Spirit. Otherwise, you will descend to the 
level of the flesh. This is what has happened to multitudes of believers. 
They  have  read  in  Galatians  that  we  are  not  under  the  law.  But  they  
do not live according to the leading of the Spirit. The result is they live 
according to the flesh. That is why we find Christian leaders today doing 
things much worse than what people did who lived under the law. How 
do believers who say they are under grace live according to the lusts of 
their flesh? Because they have thrown away the law. It is only “if you are 
led by the Spirit, that you are not under law” (Galatians 5:18). The law is 
necessary for those who do not want to be led by the Holy Spirit.

748 Through the Bible: Freedom from the Law
Galatians
The message in Galatians is not “Throw away the Law.” It is, “Throw 
away the Law only when you have come to a life in the Spirit.”
The Holy Spirit then describes what life in the flesh is like (5:19–21): 
impurity, idolatry (worship of money and people), enmity, strife, jeal-
ousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, etc. Are these 
found only among unbelievers? No. Even so-called “believers” indulge 
in these sins. Why? Because they threw away the Law before entering 
into a life in the Holy Spirit. Such will not inherit God’s kingdom (5:21). 
On  the  other  hand,  those  who  are  led  by  the  Spirit  will  bring  forth  
in their lives the fruit of “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, 
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control” (5:22, 23). If we live by the Spirit, let 
us also walk by the Spirit.
Examining Our Work
In Chapter 6:1, Paul says, “If you see a brother who has fallen away from 
this standard of life that I am describing, don’t criticise him. If you are a 
spiritual man, go and help him. You could also fall like he did.” The only 
person who can help someone who has fallen is the one who recognises 
that he too can fall in the same way. If however, someone’s attitude is, 
“It’s not possible for me to fall like this man,” then he will not be able to 
help  that  fallen  brother,  because  he  lacks  ‘the  spirit  of  gentleness’  that  
can restore backslidden believers.
We must bear the burdens of others if we are to fulfil the law of Christ. 
There is a balance however here, for it says: “Bear one another’s burdens” 
and then it says, “Each person must bear his own burden” (6:2, 5). So we 
must never seek to put our burdens on others.
In 6:3, Paul warns haughty believers, “If anyone thinks that he is some-
body great compared to other believers, he is actually a nobody.” He will 
be useless in God’s service. If you see a brother fall, don’t think that you 
are superior to him in any way. You have the same flesh as he has. God’s 
mercy and grace kept you from falling. You should never forget that.
Paul goes on to say, “Examine your own work and see what God has 
been  able  to  accomplish  through  you.”  In  1  Corinthians  11:28,  we  are  
commanded to examine ourselves – our life. Here we are commanded to 
examine our work.
Many believers criticise others when they themselves haven’t accom-
plished even 1% of what those others have done for the Lord. Such people 
would do well to shut their big mouths and examine their own work first.
In 6:7, 8, we are reminded that everyone will reap whatever he sows. 
Those who sow to the flesh will die eternally, whereas those who sow to 
the Spirit will reap eternal life. 

Examining Our Work                                                                                                                                749
Galatians
In 6:14,  Paul  speaks  about  the  cross  again.  Paul  spoke  thrice  about  
the  cross  in  Galatians.  In  2:20, he says that he himself was crucified 
with Christ. In 5:24, he says that those who are Christ’s have crucified 
the flesh with its passions and desires. Then here in 6:14, he says that 
through the cross of Christ, the world was crucified to him and he was 
crucified to the world. Self, the flesh and the world – all three – were 
crucified.  Paul  had  died  to  the  world  and  had  as  little  interest  in  it  as  
a  dead  man  has.  He  lived  on  the  high  plane  of  life  in  the  Spirit,  above  
the world. There is a close connection between living in the Spirit, and 
walking the way of the cross. 
Freedom from the law (the theme of Galatians) comes by living accord-
ing to the leading of the Holy Spirit, and walking along the way of the 
cross.



EPHESIANS
In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
E
phesians is perhaps the most spiritual letter that Paul wrote, and 
that  indicates  that  the  church  in  Ephesus  at  that  time  was  in  a  
very spiritual state. It was a very good church. There was nothing 
there for Paul to correct. 
To the Galatian Christians he had to use very strong language saying, 
“O,  foolish  Galatians.  Who  has  bewitched  you?”,  and  words  like  that.  
But among the Ephesian Christians he had nothing to correct. It was a 
wonderful church and so he was able to share with them many things 
that  he  was  not  able  to  share  with  other  churches.  To  the  Corinthian  
Christians he said, “I could only give you milk.” But to the Ephesians he 
was  able  to  share  deeper  truths.  We  can  receive  only  according  to  the  
measure  of  our  spiritual  growth.  A  baby  cannot  eat  meat,  because  it  
cannot chew. If we live like babies for a long time, we will have to live on 
milk for a long time. This is the condition of most believers. They never 
seem  to  go  on  into  the  deeper  things  of  God.  They  are  satisfied  with 
having their sins forgiven. Thereafter they see their only task as bringing 
others also to the forgiveness of sins.
If this were God’s plan then, a major portion of the New Testament can 
be thrown away as unnecessary. Why is there so much of teaching in the 
New Testament? Because God doesn’t want us to stop with the forgive-
ness of our sins. He doesn’t want us to stop with being born again and 
live on milk ever after. He wants us to grow up to maturity. The more we 
grow to maturity, the more effective our testimony will be to others. God 
is not involved in a programme of merely taking people to heaven. He is 
involved  in  a  programme  of  having  a  powerful  testimony  for  Christ  on  
earth – in Christian homes and local churches in every place. That was 
why Jesus said that we were to make disciples in every nation and teach 
them to do everything He had commanded (Matthew 28:20).

752 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
In Ephesians Paul speaks about the universal church. When we under-
stand the principle of the universal church, we will see how every local 
church should be. Ephesians deals with living a heavenly life on earth. 
A church and a Christian can fulfil their function on earth only if they 
are heavenly-minded. The more heavenly-minded you are, the more you 
can fulfil God’s purpose for you on earth. The more earthly-minded you 
are, the more useless you will be to fulfil God’s purposes on earth, even 
if  you  say  you  are  going  to  heaven  when  you  die. Your home can fulfil 
its function for God only if it is a heavenly-minded home. The Lord’s will 
for us is “that your days on earth may be like the days of heaven upon 
earth” (Deuteronomy 11:21 - KJV). This was not possible under the old 
covenant. But Ephesians tells us how we can live like that under the new 
covenant.
In Christ
There  is  an  expression  that  occurs  frequently  in  Ephesians:  ‘in  Christ’, 
or ‘in Him.’ The external ministry of Christ is something anyone can read 
in the Gospels. He cared for the poor, He touched the lepers, He healed 
the sick, He preached the gospel, etc. People of all religions admire the 
external ministry of Jesus and some of them even try to imitate Him in 
these areas. That is admirable in human eyes – and so one can get a good 
reputation  by  it.  But  Ephesians  speaks  about  being  ‘in  Christ.’  Paul  is  
speaking here about the inner life. If you follow the external life of Jesus 
without being in Christ, you will not even be saved. You can imitate Jesus 
for the honour of men. But true spirituality comes from being in Christ 
and thus seeing His inner values and His inner motives. The life of Jesus 
must first come inside us and then become manifest outside from within.
When we studied the Tabernacle, we saw that God did not begin with 
the  outer  compound  wall  made  from  sheets.  He  began  at  the  centre  –  
with the ark in the Most Holy Place. That is always God’s way. We are 
God’s  dwelling  place  as  individuals  and  as  a  church.  And  when  God  
makes  His  dwelling  place,  He  always  begins  from  within  –  from  your  
spirit.  The  word  ‘in’  occurs  89  times  in  this  brief  letter;  ‘grace’  occurs  
13 times and ‘spiritual’ occurs 13 times. Ephesians is not talking about 
material prosperity, but about spiritual prosperity. It’s not about law but 
about  grace.  It  begins  with  our  inner  life  ‘in  Christ’  and  then  proceeds  
to our outer conduct. If you keep this in mind, as you study Ephesians, 
you will understand what it means to live a heavenly life on earth. That’s 
why Ephesians  begins  with  the  phrase  “spiritual  blessings  in  heavenly  
places” (1:3).
Ephesians  is  very  neatly  divided  into  two  sections.  The  first  three 
chapters tell us about our position as believers in Christ. The next three 
chapters tell us how we are to walk on earth and how to fight the devil 
from our position ‘in Christ’. It is like a building which has a foundation 

In Christ                                                                                                                                                      753
Ephesians
and a superstructure. The foundation is in the first three chapters, and 
the superstructure in the last three chapters.
If you try to build the superstructure without this foundation ‘in Christ’, 
you will become like the non-Christians who admire Jesus’ life and say 
that  we  must  follow  His  teachings  in  the  sermon  on  the  mount.  Many  
religious people have tried to follow the sermon on the mount, and tried 
to be kind and good to others. They have tried to build the superstruc-
ture without a foundation. Christians without discernment can admire 
such a man as “Christlike”! But they are blind. A house without a foun-
dation will be washed away when the flood comes.
The  danger  of  admiring  such  men  is  that  you  can  become  like  them  
too.  You  can  spend  your  life  doing  social  work  caring  for  the  poor,  the  
lepers and the widows, etc. and get the honour of men. But if you are not 
“in Christ”, you will be rejected by God. This is a real danger that we face 
in Christendom today.
Another fact we notice in Ephesians is that there are no exhortations 
or  commandments  in  the  first  three  chapters.  We  are  not  told  to  do 
anything in those chapters. We are only told what God has done for us. 
On the other hand, Chapters 4 to 6 are full of exhortations. That is the 
balance we should have in our Christian life. We first need to be gripped 
by what God has done for us and in us. Then we can move on to God 
working through us. If God has not done a work in us first He will not 
be able to do a work through us. In such a case, it will be our trying to 
imitate  Christ.  We  can  try  and  have  a  simple  lifestyle  and  care  for  the  
poor etc. But it will all be external and hollow.
That’s why Ephesians emphasises ‘in Christ.’
People  of  many  religions  admire  Jesus  Christ  and  read  the  sermon  
on  the  mount  (Matthew  5  to  7)  and  try  to  follow  that.  They  do  a  lot  of  
good  things  too.  But  they  did  not  come  “into  Christ” first. So it is not 
God working through them in all their works. They only tried to imitate 
Christ. That is like a painted fire. An artist can paint a fire that looks 
very much like a real fire from a distance. But it doesn’t give any light 
or warmth. It is easy to be fooled by those who seek to imitate Christ, if 
we do not have discernment. Imitation of Christ can get a person a lot of 
honour in this world. But it cannot give him eternal life. A person must 
know Jesus as his personal Lord and Saviour to have eternal life. True 
service for God always flows from within a person.
Jesus  said,  “First  clean  the  inside  of  the  cup,  then  the  outside  will  be  
automatically  clean.”  That  is  what  He  emphasised  primarily  in  the  
sermon on the mount. It’s not just avoiding adultery. One should not 
lust  inwardly  after  women.  It’s  not  just  controlling  your  tongue.  The  
mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart. So controlling your 
tongue is not worth much, if your heart is filthy. In an unguarded 

754 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
moment all the filth in your heart will come out. “Watch over your heart 
with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life” (Proverbs 4:23).
Spiritual Blessings in the Heavenlies
Chapter 1:3 says, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ 
Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places 
in  Christ.”  Notice  there  that  all  these  blessings  are  spiritual,  not  mate-
rial. Earthly blessings were what the Israelites were promised under the 
old covenant. We can read that in Deuteronomy 28. This is what distin-
guishes the grace that Christ brought from the law that Moses brought. 
If there were a verse like this in the Old Testament, it would have read 
like this: “Blessed be God Almighty (not our Father) who has blessed us 
with every material blessing in earthly places in Moses.” So those believ-
ers who are seeking primarily for physical healing and material blessings 
are really going back to the old covenant. Such “believers” are actually 
Israelites and not Christians. They are followers of Moses, not of Christ.
Does that mean that God does not bless believers materially today? He 
does – but in a different way. As they seek His kingdom and His right-
eousness first, all their earthly needs are provided for them. Under 
the old covenant, people sought only these earthly things and they got 
plenty of them – many children, much property, a lot of money, victory 
over enemies, honour and position on earth, etc. But under the new 
covenant, we seek for spiritual blessings – spiritual children, spiritual 
wealth, spiritual honour, spiritual victories (over Satan and the flesh, 
and not over the Philistines or human beings). Our earthly needs, like 
the health and money we need to do the will of God, are added to us. 
God will give us as much money as He knows will not ruin us. Under 
the old covenant, God may have made some people billionaires. But he 
doesn’t do that for us today, because it might prevent us from seeking 
the things that are above – and thus destroy us.
Many  believers  have  not  understood  the  difference  between  the  old  
covenant  and  the  new  covenant.  That’s  why  they  still  pursue  after  the  
things which God promised people under the old covenant. People who 
preach  prosperity  from  the  Bible  are  very  selective  about  what  they  
preach. For  example,  the  old  covenant  blessing  in  Deuteronomy  28:11 
promised  that  God  would  bless  the  Israelites  with  plenty  of  money  as 
well as many children. But these preachers won’t preach the second part. 
This  proves  their  lack  of  integrity.  I  have  not  heard  any  one  of  these  
prosperity preachers preaching that God will bless His people with many 
children. This one fact alone is enough to prove that they are deceivers 
of the first order. They preach material prosperity because they want to 
justify their immense wealth (that they got by collecting money from poor

Ephesians
people) by quoting an irrelevant Old Testament verse. Don’t be deceived 
by such preachers.
The words “spiritual blessing” in 1:3 could be translated as “blessing of 
the Holy Spirit”. God has already given us every blessing of the Holy Spirit 
in Christ. We have only to claim them in Jesus’ name. Imagine a beggar 
girl sitting begging by the roadside. A rich prince comes by and decides to 
marry her and puts millions of rupees into a bank account – an account 
from which she can draw money freely any time she wants. What a lucky 
girl  she  is!  Once  she  had  nothing  but  a  little  tin  can  with  a  few  coins  
in it. But now she lives in grand style with the finest of clothes. She 
can withdraw any amount of money from the bank, because she has so 
many blank cheques signed by the prince. This is our picture, spiritually 
speaking. We can now go to the bank of heaven and claim every single 
blessing of the Holy Spirit because they are all ours in Christ’s Name.
Everything of heaven is ours in Christ if we remain in this bridal rela-
tionship with Him, if we can say, “Lord, I want to be true to You all my 
days  on  earth  as  Your  bride.”  Then  every  blessing  of  the  Holy  Spirit  is  
ours. We don’t have to try and convince God that we deserve any of them 
– because we do not deserve any of them. Can you imagine that beggar 
girl imagining that she deserves all the wealth she got freely? Not at all. 
All that we receive is by God’s mercy and grace. We can take everything of 
heaven because they have all been given to us freely in Christ. We cannot 
earn them by our fastings or our prayers. Many do not receive the bless-
ings of the Holy Spirit because they try to earn them in these ways! We 
cannot receive them like that. We must accept them all through Christ’s 
merit alone.
I  remember  how  the  Lord  taught  me  this  lesson  when  I  was  praying  
for some earthly need once. I said, “Lord, I have served you for so many 
years. So please do this for me.” The Lord said, “No, I won’t do it, if you 
come in your own name.” That day I understood what it means to pray 
in the Name of Jesus. That day I realised that the new believer who was 
just converted, and I who had been converted in 1959, had both to come 
to God on exactly the same basis – in the merit of Jesus Christ alone. He 
has to come to the bank of heaven with a cheque signed by Jesus Christ. 
I too can come there only with a cheque signed by Jesus Christ. If I come 
to God saying that I have been faithful to Him for so many years, then I 
am coming to heaven’s bank with a cheque signed by me. And heaven’s 
bank  will  reject  it.  That’s  the  reason  why  many  of  our  prayers  are  not  
answered. We are not going in Jesus’ Name. We are going in our name. 
We think that because we have sacrificed so much for God, He should 
answer us. Even if we have lived faithfully for 70 years, when we come 
before the Lord, we can come only on the same basis as a new convert – 
in Jesus’ name. I thank God for that revelation, because after that I never 
took a cheque to God signed with my name!! When I am tempted to do 
that I say, “That cheque will never be cashed. Let me go in Jesus’ name 

756 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
and because of His merit alone.” So every blessing of the Holy Spirit is 
ours in the heavenly places in Christ.
Chapter  1:4  says,  “He  chose  us  in  Christ  before  the  foundation  of  the  
world.” God chose us before the world was created – long before Genesis 
1:1. We saw earlier how John 1:1 comes before Genesis 1:1. John 1:1 
says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word (Jesus) was with 
God and the Word was God.” That is referring to eternity past. The next 
verse in the Bible, chronologically, is not Genesis 1:1, but Ephesians 
1:4, which also refers to eternity past. It’s a wonderful thing to recog-
nise that we who are in Christ were in God’s mind before the heavens 
and  the  earth  were  created.  Our  names  were  in  God’s  Book  of  Life  
in His mind, before He created anything. That is why we need never 
get discouraged. We are special to God. You may think you are just a 
useless  nobody,  but  if  you  are  born  again,  your  name  was  in  God’s  
mind before Genesis 1:1. Praise the Lord for that.
God didn’t choose us to go to heaven. Unfortunately, a lot of preaching 
majors on going to heaven when we die. There is no verse in the Bible 
that  says  that  God  chose  us  to  go  to  heaven  when  we  die.  God  chose  
us  so  that  we  might  live  a  holy  and  blameless  life  on  earth  before  we  
go to heaven. Many hymns we sing are about going to heaven when we 
die. But we don’t hear many hymns about God choosing us to be holy 
and  blameless.  We  should  change  our  perspective. Chapters  1  to  3  are  
the foundation. There is no stone in the foundation that says, “We were 
chosen to go to heaven when we die.” The stone in the foundation says, 
“God chose us so that we should be holy and blameless before Him.”
If  the  foundation  of  a  building  is  weak,  the  building  will  collapse.  If  
the foundation of your Christian life is weak, your life as a Christian will 
collapse. Many Christians don’t have the solid foundation of Ephesians 
1  to  3  and  that  is  why  they  collapse  later  on  in  their  lives.  If  you  have  
a crack in the fourth floor of a building, it’s most probably because the 
foundation was not strong enough. There are other buildings that have a 
hundred floors but have no cracks – because they have a deep and solid 
foundation. It’s like that in the Christian life. If you backslide 15 years 
after you are born again, it is because you did not lay a good foundation 
when  you  began  your  Christian  life.  Make  sure  that  you  are  seeking  
spiritual  blessings  from  God  primarily  and  not  physical  and  material  
blessings.  Make  sure  you  are  seeking  blessings  in  the  heavenly  places  
and not in earthly places. Make sure you are in Christ. Recognise that 
you were chosen by God not to go to heaven, but to be holy and blame-
less before Him.
We read further in 1:4, 5 “In love He predestined us.” “Predestined” is 
another word which is greatly misunderstood. What did God predestine 
us for? Was it to go to heaven or hell? No. He doesn’t predestine anyone 

The Holy Spirit and Revelation                                                                                                               757
Ephesians
to go to heaven or hell. It says here, “He predestined us to be placed as 
sons in Christ according to the kind intention of His will.” He predestined 
us to be mature sons in Christ and not baby-Christians. You are to be a 
responsible son who is interested in your heavenly Father’s business. So 
conduct yourself like a son who has a sense of responsibility about his 
Father’s  business.  What  is  the  difference  between  a  father  placing  his  
25-year-old son in his shop and placing his 4-year-old son in that shop? 
The 4-year-old will run away as soon as his friends call him to come and 
play with them. The 25-year-old, however, will stay in the shop faithfully 
and work until midnight if necessary. That’s the difference between a son 
and a child.
In  God’s  church  there  are  a  few  sons  who  have  a  tremendous  sense  
of responsibility towards God’s work. They are concerned about it and 
think about it often. They don’t work for pay; they work because they 
have a sense of responsibility. There are also babies in the church who 
never grow up. They are only interested in fun and entertainment and 
music and have very little or no sense of responsibility towards God’s 
work. They come and sit in the church-meetings, listen and do nothing 
more for the church. These are not sons, they are babies.
The Holy Spirit and Revelation
In 1:7, we read that we have “redemption through His blood, forgiveness 
of sins according to the riches of His grace”. That’s the first part of grace: 
forgiveness of sins. Romans 6:14 is another part of grace. In 1:13, we are 
reminded that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. In 1:14, the 
gift of the Holy Spirit is referred to as a pledge, a guarantee and a down 
payment on our final inheritance. If someone were buying a property 
worth 500,000 rupees, he may sign an agreement promising to pay the 
balance in three months and would make an initial payment of 50,000 
rupees.  That  10%  is  the  guarantee  that  he  will  make  the  full  payment  
and buy the property within that specified time.
God saved us and decided to make us totally like Christ one day. The 
guarantee of that is the gift of the Holy Spirit. God has not given us a new 
body as yet. He has not removed all the lusts of the flesh from our body 
as yet. How do we know that all this will be done one day? He has given 
us the Holy Spirit as a guarantee. He will make my mind exactly like the 
mind of Christ one day. 
Paul  says,  “First  of  all  I  give  thanks  for  you  because  I  have  heard  of  
your  faith  and  love  I  never  stop  giving  thanks  for  you”  (1:16).  Paul  was  
one who was always giving thanks for God’s people. He went on to say, 
“Even though God has done a wonderful work in you that you have faith 
and you also love all the saints, I am praying something more for you. 
I am praying that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory 

758 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
will  give  you  a  spirit  of  wisdom  and  revelation”  (1:17).  Notice  the  word  
‘revelation.’  That  is  a  new  covenant  word.  Under  the  old  covenant,  the  
emphasis was on meditation on the Law (Psalm 1:2). But under the new 
covenant, the emphasis is on getting revelation from the Holy Spirit on 
the Word. Under the old covenant, the important thing was to know the 
Scriptures. But under the new covenant, the important thing is to know 
God Himself.
Paul goes on to say, “I am praying that the eyes of your heart (not your 
mind) be enlightened” (1:18). The emphasis in the new covenant is always 
on  the  heart.  In  the  Old  Testament,  the  emphasis  was  on  knowledge  
entering the head. But now it is on light entering the heart. There were a 
few men in the Old Testament who were men of the heart. Proverbs speaks 
a lot about the heart. David was a man after God’s own heart. But gener-
ally speaking, the priests and the Bible-scholars under the old covenant 
were  not  men  of  the  heart.  It  was  intellectual  study  of  the  Scriptures  
that produced the scribes and the Pharisees – who crucified Jesus. If 
you  spend  your  life  just  using  your  head  to  study  the  Scriptures  and  
acquire  a  lot  of  Bible-knowledge,  you  will  end  up  being  another  scribe  
or Pharisee. The truth of God must sink down from your head into your 
heart  and  become  revelation.  That  12-inch  drop  from  the  head  to  the  
heart is what makes all the difference! 
Paul prayed that “the eyes of their heart would be enlightened so that 
they would see:
1. The hope of God calling them;
2. The riches of the glory of God’s inheritance in the saints; and 
3. The greatness of God’s power available to them” (1:18, 19).
Paul  did  not  ask  them  to  read  his  letter  25  times  to  understand  these  
truths.  They  could  have  read  it  a  hundred  times  and  still  not  under-
stood. He prayed that they would get revelation from the Holy Spirit on 
these  great  truths.  You  can  study  the  root  meanings  of  all  the  Hebrew  
and Greek words in the Bible and still be totally blind spiritually and not 
experience a single “spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ”, or 
become “holy and blameless” as you were predestined by God to be.
When you get revelation from the Holy Spirit on the Bible, things become 
different. You may not know Greek, but you will know Christ. You will be 
in Christ. You will be able to take the cheques in the Bible (the promises 
of God) to the Bank of Heaven and cash them and become a spiritually 
rich person. So don’t ever pursue study of the Bible without revelation. 
The purpose of your Bible study must be to get revelation from the Holy 
Spirit. Anybody who emphasises the head over the heart, is leading you 
astray. I am not against using our minds. When I study or preach, I use 
my mind extensively. Otherwise I wouldn’t be able to speak to you. But I 
have made my mind a slave of the Holy Spirit. When studying the Bible,

we  begin  by  using  our  eyes  (body)  to  read.  Then  the  Word  enters  our  
mind (soul). But then the Word must penetrate beyond our soul to our 
spirit, where the Holy Spirit will give us revelation.
We can see an illustration of this in the old covenant tabernacle which 
had 3 parts. The outer court symbolised our body, by which we read or 
hear God’s Word. The next area, the Holy Place, symbolised our soul, 
through which we understand (mind) and are stirred (emotions) by the 
Word. Then comes the Most Holy Place symbolising our spirit, where 
God gives us revelation on His Word that leads to obedience. It is only 
when  we  get  revelation  that  we  have  really  heard  God  through  His  
Word. Only then can we accomplish God’s purposes.
So  let  all  your  Bible  study  go  beyond  reading  and  understanding  to  
revelation  and  obedience.  Jesus  died  and  the  veil  was  rent  so  that  we  
might  enter  the  Most  Holy  Place  (Hebrews  10:20). The  Pharisees  read  
their Bible and understood it, but they didn’t get any revelation on it and 
so they considered Jesus to be Beelzebub, the prince of demons. Peter, 
however,  got  revelation  on  the  Scriptures  and  saw  that  Jesus  was  the  
Son of God and the Messiah.
The Holy Spirit wants us to know the hope with which God has called 
us. Once  you  see  this,  it  will  change  your  attitude  to  all  the  impurity  
there  is  in  this  world.  We  are  called  to  be  holy.  We  cannot  read  or  see  
what others in the world feel free to read and see. Consider a surgeon in 
an operating-theatre, about to do an operation on a patient. His hands 
have to be absolutely clean and sterile; otherwise he could kill the patient 
with the germs on his hands. If a pair of scissors falls to the ground he 
won’t touch it or use it. In our eyes that pair of scissors may look very 
clean. But there is defilement in it because there are germs on the floor. 
A true Christian lives in the world with a similar passion for 100% purity.
Others  may  indulge  themselves  in  many  worldly  pleasures.  But  God  
has called us for a holy purpose and we have to fulfil it. It is because 
Christian  leaders  don’t  live  in  such  purity  that  they  defile  their  flock 
with their “defiled, unsterile hearts” and bring spiritual death wherever 
they go.
Have you seen the hope of His calling you? 
Have you seen the riches of glory of His inheritance in the saints? This 
is not referring to our inheritance in heaven, but to God’s inheritance in 
us. God has an inheritance in us.
Resurrection Power
Have you seen the greatness of His power that He can manifest in us? 
The  greatest  power  that  God  ever  manifested  in  this  universe  was  not  
in creation, but in the resurrection of Jesus (1:20). What we see in the 

760 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
universe around us is the first creation. In the resurrection of Jesus, 
began the second creation, the new creation. The new creation is more 
powerful than the old one. What you read in John 20 is more powerful 
that  what  you  read  in  Genesis  1. The  resurrection  of  Christ  was  the  
greatest manifestation of power ever seen in this universe. Moral power 
is greater than physical power.
Paul  prays  that  we  will  have  revelation  on  the  fact  that  God  wants  
us  to  experience  that  power.  He  wants  us  to  experience  that  power  in  
our inner life first. Later we will experience it in our bodies as well, one 
day. God’s work always starts from within. One day we will experience 
the resurrection power of Christ in our bodies. Today, God wants us to 
experience that resurrection power in our spirit. Resurrection power is 
a power that will lift us up from spiritual death. The law of sin brings us 
down to spiritual death. Resurrection power lifts us up against that.
Resurrection power, lifting us up from the law of sin, is like me lifting a 
book against the law of gravity (which seeks to pull it down). Resurrection 
power lifts us up to the heavenly places. We read in 2:1–6 that when we 
were dead in our sins, it was this power that raised us up and made us 
sit  together  with  Christ  in  the  heavenly  places  (2:6). Some  may  think  
this is fanciful, picture language. But it is not. It is actually true. If you 
don’t believe that this is true, you will never get any of the benefits of this 
– for we receive according to the measure of our faith. Let God be true 
and every man a liar. Our feelings are all deceptive. Even our vision can 
deceive us.
There is a story of two little boys watching the sun set. The older boy 
who was about 12 years old said, “Hey, the sun moved. It was in the 
east in the morning, now it’s in the west.” The younger boy who was 
only 6 years old said, “No. You remember what Daddy told us. It’s not 
the sun that moves. It’s the earth that rotates on its axis.” The older 
boy said, “I believe what I see and what I feel. I saw the sun in the east 
and now it is in the west. And I did not feel the earth rotating under my 
feet. It was stationary.” The younger boy said, “I believe Daddy.” 
Who was right – the one who believed his father, or the one who believed 
what he saw and felt? Many Christians also live by what they see and 
feel. But our senses can deceive us. So I believe my heavenly Father; 
and what He says is always right, even if I cannot see it or feel it.
So I believe what God says that I have been raised up and placed in the 
heavenly places in Christ. I don’t care what my feelings tell me. I know 
that my feelings are as deceptive as my vision. I have found that when I 
believe what my heavenly Father says, everything works out all-right in 
my  life.  When  we  don’t  believe  our  heavenly  Father,  we  end  up  having  
many problems. We are told here that this amazing resurrection power 

Resurrection Power                                                                                                                                  761

is not available to all people, but only for those who believe. If you don’t 
believe this, then you will not experience this power. Jesus told Thomas, 
“Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe” (John 20:29). I am 
one of those.
I am more blessed than the apostles, because I have believed in Jesus 
without seeing Him with my eyes. If your father were a multi-millionaire 
who loves you, and he tells you one day that he has put a million rupees 
in your bank account, would you believe him, or would you have to go to 
the bank to check it out first? God says, “He has placed me in the heav-
enly places in Christ.” I believe it. I don’t belong to this earth any more. 
For many years I belonged to this earth. But a day came in my life when I 
realised that I belonged to heaven, and now my mind is set on the things 
above,  even  though  my  body  is  here  on  this  earth.  That  is  why  I  don’t  
fight for earthly things now. I don’t even fight to get people to remain in 
my church. If someone were to tell me one day that some preacher had 
lured away a brother from my church, I would say, “Praise the Lord. I am 
not going to fight with anyone for that. If he wants to go to some other 
church,  let  him  go  wherever  he  is  going  to  be  happy.”  Jesus  said,  “My  
kingdom is not of this world. That is why My servants do not fight.”  We  
see so many believers fighting for position and honour and money on 
earth  and  in  churches.  Such  believers  are  earthly-minded  and  are  not  
“seated in heaven”. They are actually – unbelievers who are holding on to 
a Christian doctrine in their minds. They have not allowed the Holy Spirit 
to lift them up to the heavenly places in Christ. 
Ephesians 1 to 3 is the foundation of the Christian life. God lifts us up 
to the heavenly places. We cannot do that on our own. We can never raise 
ourselves from the dead. Even Jesus did not raise Himself from the dead. 
The Bible always says that God raised Him from the dead. Jesus did say 
that He had the authority to raise Himself from the dead (John 10:18). But 
He never used that authority. He allowed the Father to raise Him from 
the dead. In baptism, when another person pushes you under the water, 
it is he who lifts you up. You don’t lift yourself up. This symbolises God 
lifting us up in resurrection power. When we submit to others crucifying 
us, then God raises us up and keeps us seated in the heavens. From that 
heavenly standpoint, everything on earth will look small. When travelling 
in an aeroplane, huge buildings on earth look like toy buildings and large 
cars look like toy cars. The things of earth will become small in your eyes 
and you will stop fighting for them when you are seated in the heavens 
with Christ – even as you would not fight for toy cars.
Paul  then  goes  on  to  speak  about  our  salvation.  Our  salvation  is  by  
faith (2:8), not as a result of works. But even though it is not as a result 
of works, God has planned good works so that we should walk in them 
(2:10). Then in 2:11–22, he speaks about how God makes us one body 
in Christ. The dividing wall between Jews and Gentiles has been broken 
down. When Jesus died on the cross, He abolished the enmity between 

762 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
Jews and non-Jews (2:14, 15). The Jews and the non-Jews are the most 
opposite races there are in the world. It is worse than any caste system in 
India. But Jesus brought them both together at the cross. He abolished 
the enmity. If you are in Christ, all the enmity that you had towards other 
communities  is  broken  down.  If  such  enmity  is  still  there  towards  any  
other person, you are not crucified with Christ. He wants to make us all 
one body. You can become one body only with a believer whose life is in 
the heavenly places. A church of earth-minded people will be just a group 
of people, a congregation. You have to get people to live in the heavenly 
places in Christ, if they are to become one body (2:16).
In Chapter 3 Paul speaks about a great mystery. This was a mystery 
which  was  not  revealed  under  the  old  covenant  –  that  the  non-Jews  
and the Jews were going to become one (3:4). The way to this has been 
revealed by the Holy Spirit only under the new covenant.
There  are  two  prayers  in  the  first  three  chapters  of Ephesians.  In  
1:17–23 is a prayer for revelation through the Holy Spirit and in 3:14–21 
is a prayer for the power of the Holy Spirit. These are the two things 
we need – the revelation of the Holy Spirit to see what we are in Christ 
Jesus, and the power of the Holy Spirit to live the life that is going to 
be described in Chapters 4 to 6.
The second prayer is: “That He will grant you according to the riches of 
His glory to be strengthened by power by His Spirit in the inner man, so 
that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith” (3:16, 17). The last part of 
that verse means, “that Christ may feel at home in your heart.”
We  all  know  the  difference  between  living  in  someone’s  home  and  
feeling  “at  home”  there.  When  staying  in  some  homes,  we  feel  uncom-
fortable. But in other homes, they make us feel perfectly at home. In the 
same  way,  Jesus  may  be  dwelling  in  your  heart.  But  the  question  is,  
“Does He feel at home there?” Or is He unhappy with some things that 
you have in your heart and home. But there are some in whose hearts 
Jesus feels perfectly at home. The Holy Spirit fills us so that Christ can 
feel perfectly at home within us.
“That  you  may  be  able  to  understand  with  all  the  saints  what  is  the  
breadth and the height and depth of the love of Christ” (3:18). We cannot 
understand  the  love  of  Christ  all  by  ourselves.  Only  along  with  all  of  
God’s  saints  can  we  know  the  love  of  Christ  fully.  Paul  concludes  by  
saying, “That you may be filled up to all the fullness of God” (3:19). Then 
3:20, 21 tells us that we can receive from God far beyond what we can 
ever ask or think. What God wants to do for us is way beyond what we 
can ever imagine.

Ephesians
A Heavenly Life on Earth
Now we come to Chapters 4 to 6. Many believers live in Chapters 1 to 3 
only. They rejoice that they are seated in the heavenly places. They are 
“so heavenly minded that they are of no earthly use.” But that was not 
how  Jesus  lived.  He  was  the  most  heavenly-minded  person  who  ever  
walked on earth. Yet, His life was the most useful life for all humanity. 
Our mind must be in heaven, but our feet must be on earth. Our heavenly 
life must be manifested in practical ways on earth. Jesus demonstrated 
how a Christian must live this heavenly life on earth – as a little boy, as a 
teenager, as a working man and as a full time preacher. We live our lives 
at home, at our place of work and in Christian activities. In all these three 
areas, Jesus has demonstrated to us the spirit of heaven. Anything less 
than this way of life is not true Christianity.
Jesus was not a hermit. He did not dress or eat differently from the 
others around Him. He lived and worked just like all the others. He looked 
so  much  like  the  others  that  the  Roman  soldiers  needed  someone  to  
identify Him in the garden of Gethsemane. That shows us that He looked 
just  like  his  disciples  in  every  way.  Externally,  He  was  just  like  them,  
but inwardly He was heavenly-minded. Heavenly attitudes controlled His 
behaviour and His actions. That is how we are to live in our homes and 
in the church. This is what Chapters 4 to 6 are all about.
Chapter  4  begins  with  these  words:  “Therefore,  I  implore  you  to  walk  
in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called” (4:1). 
In the first three chapters there is no exhortation. Everything in those 
chapters deals with what God has done for us. He chose us in Christ and 
blessed us with every spiritual blessing, lifted us up from our dead state 
and placed us in Christ in the heavenly places, made us His inheritance, 
gave us His power, defeated Satan, united Jew and non-Jew in one Body 
on the cross, etc. All of this was God’s work. We had no part in it. So the 
emphasis in Chapters 1 to 3 is on receiving revelation on these truths. 
Now we have to live out this revelation in our daily life.
The purpose of all this is that the many-sided wisdom of God may be 
made known through the church to angelic authorities (both good and 
bad)  in  the  heavenly  places  (3:10).  Satan  and  his  demons  kept  saying  
ever  since  Adam’s  fall,  that  no  man  could  ever  live  a  heavenly  life  on  
earth. But Jesus disproved Satan’s lie by the way He lived. Jesus came 
like us, was tempted like us and yet lived a heavenly life on this earth. 
Now Satan says two things:
1. “Perhaps  Jesus  could  do  it,  but  no-one  else  can.  Every  believer  will  
be earthly-minded.” And God’s reply is: “I will show you in My church 
that there are some who will live with a heavenly mind on earth.” 
2. “It is impossible for people who are different from each other to become 
one.  Malayalees  and  Tamilians  cannot  become  one.  Anglo-Indians  
and  Malayalees  cannot  be  one.  Westerners  and  Easterners  cannot  

764 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
become one”. God’s reply is: “I will show you in My church how all these 
and many other groups can become one with each other in Christ.” 
These are the two challenges that we face as believers to demonstrate 
to Satan, so that God can boast about us as He could about Job (Job 1:8).
But  unfortunately,  that  is  not  what  we  see  in  most  of  Christendom  
today.  Most  Christians  live  defeated  lives  and  most  churches  are  
dis united. But God still has a remnant here and there in a few places on 
earth concerning whom He can boast to Satan and at whose lives even 
the angels in heaven are amazed.
Chapter 4:2 begins thus: “With all humility and gentleness.” I have often 
stated that the three secrets of the Christian life are: Humility, Humility, 
and  Humility.  That’s  where  everything  begins.  Jesus  humbled  Himself  
and said in Matthew 11:29, “Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, 
for I am humble and gentle.” The only two things He ever told us to learn 
from Him were humility and gentleness. Why? Because as the children 
of Adam, we are all proud and hard. If you want to demonstrate a heav-
enly life on earth, it is not going to be demonstrated first by evangelism, 
preaching, Bible teaching, or social work. It is going to be demonstrated 
by an attitude of humility and gentleness first of all. 
When God gave the pattern of the tabernacle to Moses, He began with 
the  ark.  When  planning  any  construction,  man  begins  with  the  outer  
dimensions of the building. But God began from the innermost sanctu-
ary. Man seeks to clean the outside of the cup. But God seeks to clean 
the inside first. He begins with the inside and then moves towards the 
outside.  If  you  are  human  in  your  thinking  and  approach,  you  will  be  
more  concerned  about  the  outside  that  men  can  see.  If  you  are  more  
divine, you will be concerned with the inside that only God can see. You 
will be more concerned about the quality of the people in your church, 
than about the number of the people. Size impress people. God looks at 
the quality of the people.
God looks for humility, gentleness and patience. 4:2 (LB) says “Make 
allowances  for  each  other’s  faults  because  of  your  love”.  No-one  in  any  
church  is  perfect.  Everyone  makes  mistakes.  So  in  the  church  we  will  
have to bear with one another’s mistakes. We have to make allowances 
for  each  other’s  mistakes  because  we  love  one  another.  “If  you  make  a  
mistake  I  will  cover  it  up.  If  you  leave  something  undone,  I  will  do  it”. 
That’s how the Body of Christ is to function.
Unity in the Body of Christ
“Be diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace” (4:3). 
Unity is a great theme in many of Paul’s letters. And this is the burden 
the Lord has for His church too. When a human body dies, it begins to 
disintegrate.  Our  body  is  made  of  dust,  and  the  bits  of  dust  are  held  

Unity in the Body of Christ                                                                                                                      765
Ephesians
together because there is life in this body. The moment the life is gone, 
disintegration starts; and after a while, we find that the whole body has 
become dust. It is the same in a fellowship of believers. When the believ-
ers in a church are disunited, we can be sure that death has already come 
in.  When  a  husband  and  wife  are  disunited,  you  know  that  death  has  
already entered, even if they never divorce each other. Disintegration can 
start in a marriage within a day after they are married – with mis under-
standings,  tensions,  quarrels,  etc.  That  can  happen  in  a  church  too.  
A church usually starts with a few zealous brothers who come together 
with great zeal to build a pure work for the Lord. Very soon disunity comes 
in and death enters. We have to fight a battle constantly to preserve the 
unity of the Spirit – both in a marriage and in a church.
The wonderful thing about the human body is that all the little bits of 
dust that it is made of, are all united together so closely that one cannot 
see where they are joined. If the body is injured, certain processes start 
within  it  immediately  to  close  up  the  skin.  The  body  does  not  like  any  
part  of  its  skin  to  remain  gaping  and  open.  It  starts  working  immedi-
ately to unite the separated parts of the skin. It is the same when a bone 
breaks. The body immediately starts working to unite it. No man on earth 
can join two bones together. A doctor can only place the broken parts of 
the bone next to each other. It is the body itself that joins those two parts 
together. The human body always works towards unity. That’s how the 
Body of Christ also should function. When a church does not function 
like that, it is not representing the Body of Christ.
God is not building a bunch of holy individuals. He is building a Body. 
This is what Paul is speaking about in Chapter 4. He urges us to “preserve 
this unity of the spirit because there is one body.” When can we say that 
there is unity in a local body? “By the bond of peace” (4:3). “The mind of 
the Spirit is peace” (Romans 8:6). When you think of a brother or sister, 
and your thoughts are thoughts of peace and rest towards him/her, then 
you  know  that  there  is  unity  between  you  and  that  person.  But  if  you  
are even slightly agitated when you think of that person, then you can be 
sure that you are not united with that person. You may greet him with an 
exuberant, “Praise the Lord”, but it is hypocritical. Peace is the test. So 
the unity of the spirit must be preserved in the bond of peace.
In 4:5, when it speaks of “one baptism”, it means one Scriptural baptism. 
The christening of children which some people call “child baptism” is not 
a baptism at all. So if you were christened as a child, you have not been 
baptised at all.
Then Paul speaks about the gifts needed to build up Christ’s Body. It 
is impossible to build the church without the supernatural gifts given by 
the Lord – and God has a gift for everyone in Christ’s Body: “To each one 
of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift” (4:7).
Then we read about Jesus’ ascension: “When He ascended He led captive 
a host of captives” (4:8). This is what that verse means: When Jesus died 

766 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
He went to the heart of the earth for three days and three nights as He 
said He would (Matthew 12:40). Thus we know that paradise was at that 
time in the heart of the earth, because Jesus told the repentant thief that 
he would be with Him in paradise that day. Then Jesus came back into 
His body (which was in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea) and came out 
of the tomb. Then He was on earth for another 40 days, and appeared to 
many people. After that He ascended to heaven. When He ascended, He 
took all the people who were in paradise (who had been captives in the 
heart of the earth) up with Him to the third heaven.
We  know  today,  that  paradise  is  in  the  third  heaven,  because  in  
2  Corinthians  12:2  and  4,  we  read  that  Paul  was  taken  there.  And  he  
says he was taken up and not down. When a child of God dies today, he 
does not go down to the heart of the earth like Moses, David, and Jesus 
went when they died, but he goes up to the third heaven where Christ is 
today. Christ descended first into the lower parts of the earth (4:9). Hell 
was also there, but there was a big gulf between hell and paradise – as 
we read in the true story of the rich man and Lazarus. Hell is still in the 
centre of the earth.
After Christ ascended up to heaven, He gave gifts to the church. These 
gifts  were  people.  Christ  gave  the  church  apostles,  prophets,  evange-
lists, shepherds and teachers (4:11). These gifted men had to equip ALL 
the believers to build up the Body of Christ. It is important to note this. 
These gifted men were NOT to build the church by themselves. They were 
to equip the believers, so that the believers would build up the Body of 
Christ. Every believer has a part to do in building up the Body of Christ. 
But such a work is so rarely seen today.
First  among  the  gifted  men  are  the  apostles.  These  are  not  the  first 
twelve  apostles  alone,  because  it  says  here  that  Christ  gave  them  to  
the church AFTER He ascended into heaven. In Acts, we read that Paul 
and Barnabas are also called apostles. And in Revelation 2:2, we read, 
that at a time when there was only one of the original 12 apostles living 
(John), the Lord said to the church in Ephesus, “You tested those who 
claimed to be apostles and found them to be false.” That proves that there 
were  other  genuine  apostles  also  at  that  time.  Otherwise  there  would  
not  have  been  any  need  to  test  anyone  who  claimed  to  be  an  apostle.  
There  are  apostles  today  too.  Apostles  are  not  necessarily  those  who  
write  Scripture.  Andrew  and  many  of  the  original  12  apostles  did  not  
write  any  Scripture.  And  there  were  non-apostles  like  Mark  and  Luke  
who wrote Scripture. Apostles were men who were sent out by God with a 
specific task. The word ‘apostle’ means ‘sent one’ – a man sent by God to 
a particular place at a particular time. They establish local churches in a 
number of places and appoint elders in those places. Then these apostles 
become elders to those elders, guide them, solve their church problems 
and lead them to maturity. Although an apostle may have a home-base 

Unity in the Body of Christ                                                                                                                      767
Ephesians
in a church, he will not have any responsibility over the members of that 
local church. His responsibility will be for the elders of the churches.
Next come the prophets. These are men who are given the discernment to 
diagnose the problems in a church. They are like good doctors who can 
diagnose  a  patient’s  sickness,  give  him  the  right  medicine,  or  perform  
the needed surgery, remove the cancer and cure him. Prophets are not 
very popular, because they are always exposing the cancer of sin in every 
church. Many people may not be happy to see the results of their body-
scan. Even so, many believers are not happy when a prophet tells them 
about their sinful inner state. But this is the most important ministry in 
a local church. For any church to remain in spiritual life, it must have 
prophets who expose sin in every meeting. Then people will be convicted 
of their hidden sins and acknowledge that God is present in the meeting 
and turn to Him (1 Corinthians 14:24, 25). I am not referring now to the 
multitude of false prophets in Christendom today who tell people where 
to  go,  or  whom  to  marry,  or  who  threaten  them  with  judgement.  That  
is counterfeit prophecy. Directive prophecy is NEVER found in the new 
covenant. That was the ministry of old covenant prophets, at a time when 
only the prophets had the Holy Spirit. But that is not the case today. 
Next are the evangelists. These are believers who are given a burden for 
those who have never heard the gospel and who are given the ability to 
bring them to the Lord – either through personal evangelism or through 
evangelistic  meetings.  The  evangelist  is  like  the  hand  in  the  body  that  
takes a slice of bread (type if an unbeliever) and puts it into the mouth. 
The prophet then is like the teeth that chew that slice and make it small, 
and also like the stomach that pours acids on it and reduces its size, and 
finally makes it a part of the body. The gentle ministry of picking up the 
slice is more appreciated than the acid-pouring ministry. But both are 
needed if the slice of bread is to become a part of the body. So the evan-
gelist and the prophet have to work together.
Next come the shepherds. The Greek words poimen (noun) and poimaino 
(verb) are used 29 times in the New Testament and are always translated 
as “shepherd,” “to shepherd” in every other place. Here alone has it been 
translated as “pastor”. This has led to a lot of misunderstanding of this 
ministry in Christendom. Shepherds are those who look after the sheep, 
and care for them when they are hungry or wounded. A shepherd’s job 
is to nurture the sheep, tenderly care for the little ones (the lambs), and 
to ensure that they grow up to maturity. Every church needs shepherds, 
not just one pastor. Jesus shepherded only 12 men. So if a church has 
120  men,  it  needs  10  shepherds  to  look  after  them.  I  am  not  referring  
to  10  full-time  paid  workers  who  have  the  title  of  ‘pastor.’  I  am  refer-
ring to those who have a shepherd’s heart to care for those younger to

Ephesians
them.  They  could  be  men  who  are  holding  secular  jobs,  but  who  seek  
to  encourage  the  younger  ones  in  the  church.  A  25-year-old  man  can  
encourage  all  the  teenagers  in  his  church  and  thus  be  a  shepherd  to  
them. Many such men can be a great help to the elders in a church. As 
a church grows in size, it needs more shepherds. Mega-churches are not 
in God’s plan for Christ’s Body, but small churches with shepherds who 
have  a  father’s  heart.  Large  churches  are  actually  “preaching  centres”  
where people come to be entertained and educated, but not to grow in 
grace. The leaders of such churches are merely good administrators and 
preachers/teachers, but not shepherds. 
Finally,  we  have  the  teachers.  These  are  the  men  who  can  explain  the  
word  of  God  and  make  it  simple  and  understandable  to  people.  There  
are not many good teachers in Christendom. But then every church does 
not need a teacher. One teacher is enough to travel around and teach 20 
or  30  churches.  And  nowadays  with  CDs,  DVDs  and  the  Internet,  one  
teacher can reach hundreds of churches. In the same way, every church 
does not need an evangelist, because an evangelist can bring people to 
Christ and then move on elsewhere. But what every church does need 
are prophets and shepherds.
The purpose of all these ministries is to build up the Body of Christ. An 
evangelist  must  not  bring  souls  to  Christ  and  then  tell  them  to  go  to  
whichever church they like or to go back to their old dead church. That’s 
not  the  type  of  evangelist  spoken  of  here  in  Ephesians  4.  But  unfortu-
nately, today we have evangelists who have their own name attached to 
their ministry. They conduct meetings and people are saved (hopefully). 
Then  they  tell  them  to  go  back  to  their  dead  churches.  In  those  dead  
churches, there are no shepherds or teachers to lead them to the truth. 
Here  in  Chapter  4,  we  read  of  evangelists  working  together  with  the  
apostles, prophets, shepherds and teachers. The evangelist must hand 
over  the  converts  to  good  shepherds.  This  is  the  type  of  cooperation  
we  need  in  the  Body  of  Christ.  This  is  how  it  was  in  the  early  days  of  
the church. Philip was an evangelist, but not an apostle or a shepherd 
(Acts 8). So others in Samaria took over the responsibility from Philip to 
lead those converts further into the truth of God. Philip did not let them 
wander around on their own. 
Unfortunately, a lot of evangelistic ministry today only builds up one 
man’s name – and he makes a lot of money for himself from the offerings 
of people. It has become a profession and not the calling spoken of here 
in 4:11. That is not the type of evangelist spoken of here. Here the evan-
gelist is one who builds the Body of Christ and not his own ministry or 
his name.

Growth in the Body of Christ                                                                                                                  769
Ephesians
Growth in the Body of Christ
Further, Paul speaks here about the necessity of unity in the Body. He 
says that as believers, we must all “preserve the unity of the spirit ... until 
we  attain  to  the  unity  of  the  faith”  (4:3,  13).  There  may  be  many  areas  
where as believers we do not see eye-to-eye. You may not agree with my 
view that the church will go through the tribulation before Christ comes 
to take her up to Himself. You may feel that Christ will come before the 
tribulation. There could be other differences of opinion like that. We have 
not attained to unity in ALL matters of the faith. But until we do, we must 
be united in spirit. We don’t have to wait until we are united in all matters 
of the faith before we are united in spirit.
We  are  to  grow  up  gradually  “to  a  mature  man,  to  the  fullness  of  the  
stature of Christ” (4:13). Our aim must be to grow ourselves and to help 
others to grow to this fullness. We must not remain babies “tossed here 
and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the 
trickery  of  men,  by  craftiness  in  deceitful  scheming”  (4:14). God  allows  
us  to  be  exposed  to  deception  and  false  teaching  so  that  we  can  grow  
in discernment. Our sense of discernment will not be developed other-
wise. That’s why He allows so many deceivers and false prophets to move 
around in Christendom. Thus we will be able to discern the one whose 
spirit is not right from the one whose spirit is right. We don’t have to judge 
others. But we must discern. Then our spiritual senses will be exercised.
In 4:15, we are urged to “speak the truth in love in order to grow up.” 
Notice  there  the  balance  between  truth  and  love.  Should  we  speak  the  
truth? Yes. Always. But are we permitted to speak it in any way we like? 
No. We  must  speak  the  truth  in  love.  If  you  cannot  speak  the  truth  in 
love, then you should wait until you have enough love for people to speak 
the  truth  to  them.  Love  is  the  board  on  which  you  can  use  the  pen  of  
truth. If you try to write the truth without a board to write it on, you will 
be  writing  in  thin  air.  No-one  will  be  able  to  understand  what  you  are  
writing. It is by speaking the truth in love always – in the pulpit and in 
private conversation – that we can “grow up in all aspects into Him who 
is the head, even Christ.”
In 4:16, he speaks of “the whole body, being fitted and held together by 
what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individ-
ual part, causing the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love”. 
The joints here speak of fellowship. Consider how many joints you have 
in just one arm. There is a joint at the shoulder, another at the elbow, 
one at the wrist, and then three in each finger – at least 17. It’s the joints 
that make your arm work freely. If you had a strong upper arm and a 
strong  lower  arm,  but  if  your  elbow  was  stiff,  what  could  you  do  with  
that arm? Nothing. It is not just strength that makes your arm useful. 
It is also functioning joints. Consider now the application of this to the 
Body of Christ. Here is a good brother, a strong upper arm. And here is 
another  good  brother,  a  strong  lower  arm.  But  they  cannot  fellowship  

770 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
together with each other. That is the tragedy in the Body of Christ today. 
In the human body, this is called arthritis and it is very painful. A lot of 
local churches have arthritis. When our joints function properly, there is 
no noise. But when a body has arthritis, it creaks and every movement 
produces  an  unhealthy  noise.  What  is  called  “fellowship”  among  some  
believers is exactly like that. It creaks. But when the joints function well, 
there is no noise at all. Our fellowship with each other must be like that. 
If it is not like that with you, then you need to take some medicine for 
arthritis: Die to your “self-life”. Then you will be healed and your fellow-
ship with others will be glorious. That is the will of God in the Body of 
Christ.
Then  we  have  some  strong  exhortations  in  4:17–25:  “Don’t  walk  like  
other people in this world walk. Their understanding is darkened and they 
are excluded from the life of God. You must walk differently. You did not 
learn Christ in this way.” Do you know the difference between learning 
the Bible and learning Christ? When we read the Bible, we must learn 
Christ and not just get Bible-knowledge. If we learn Christ, we will not 
walk like the heathen. We will put away our manner of former life and we 
will be renewed in the spirit of our minds (verse 23). We will put away all 
falsehood (verse 25).
In 4:26, we are exhorted to get rid of all our anger before the sun sets. 
People went to bed in olden times soon after sunset. So this verse exhorts 
us to get rid of every wrong attitude before we go to bed daily. Husbands 
and wives, don’t ever go to bed without settling your quarrels and causes 
of tension. You are warned in this verse, that if you don’t do that, you will 
give the devil an opportunity to come between both of you.
Then there is some practical advice. Those who stole in the past must 
do the opposite now. They must earn honestly and share what they have 
with  others  (4:28). We  must  be  careful  about  our  speech  and  ensure  
that no word ever comes out of our mouths that grieves the Holy Spirit 
(4:29,  30). ALL  bitterness,  wrath  and  anger  must  be  put  away  (4:31). 
These  verses  teach  clearly  that  there  must  be  ZERO  bitterness,  ZERO  
anger, ZERO gossiping and backbiting, ZERO slander and ZERO hatred 
in our lives.
I remember seeing a board on the wall of an automobile factory that 
said: “OUR AIM IS ZERO DEFECT”. The company wanted their workers 
to aim to produce cars with zero defect. And I thought, “My aim also must 
be to have Zero defect”. It may take time for all of us to get there. But that 
must  be  our  goal.  If  automobile  manufacturers  can  press  on  towards  
zero defect, why can’t Christians also seek to press on to that?
“Be  kind  to  one  another,  tender-hearted,  forgiving  each  other,  just  as  
God in Christ also has forgiven you. Be imitators of God, as beloved child-
ren; and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for 
us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma” (4:32; 5:1, 2).

Growth in the Body of Christ                                                                                                                  771
Ephesians
Our calling is to imitate God and walk in love. There can be no higher 
calling than that. 
“Impurity  and  greed  must  not  even  be  named  among  you.  There  must  
be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, 
but  rather  giving  of  thanks.  For  this  you  know  with  certainty,  that  no  
immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an 
inheritance  in  the  kingdom  of  Christ  and  God.  Let  no  one  deceive  you  
with empty words” (5:3–6). What a high standard this is for our conver-
sation. One way to avoid the negative (foolish jesting and impurity) is 
by  concentrating  on  the  positive  (being  thankful  for  everything).  We  
should  not  be  deceived  into  thinking  that  our  conversation  has  no  
effect on our eternal destiny.
Since  our  lifetime  on  earth  is  short,  we  must  make  the  most  of  our  
time because the days are evil – knowing what God’s will for our life is 
(5:16, 17).
Then we come to this wonderful verse, “Be not drunk with wine but be 
filled with the Holy Spirit” (5:18). Notice two commands there. The first 
one is, “Don’t be drunk with wine.” The second is, “Be filled with the Spirit.” 
Why is it that Christians who would never disobey the first command 
here do not take the second one seriously? This is but one example of 
how  Satan  blinds  our  minds  to  the  truths  of  Scripture.  Most  believers  
consider the first as a command (“Don’t  get  drunk”)  but  the  second  as  
a suggestion (“Be filled with the Spirit”)!! But both are commands – and 
both are equally important. If it is a serious matter to be drunk even once 
in a year, then it is equally serious not to be filled with the Spirit even one 
single day in a year. Have you seen it like that?
The  verb  in  5:18b  is  a  continuous  verb  –  it  means  “be being filled”, 
“keep on being filled”, and not “be filled once”. If we were filled with the 
Spirit in the morning, we need to be filled with the Holy Spirit in the 
evening and every day continuously. Ask God to fill you with His Spirit all 
the time. Such people were referred to in Acts as “men and women FULL 
of the Holy Spirit”.
One of the primary marks of being filled with the Spirit is a change 
in  the  way  we  speak.  Our  tongue  will  become  “a tongue of fire”  (Acts 
2:3). This is not “speaking in other tongues”, but “speaking in our mother 
tongue with God’s fire of love and purity”. Our language will become heav-
enly. Notice the emphasis on our speech in these verses “Be filled with 
the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual 
songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; always 
giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, 
even  the  Father”  (5:19,  20). The  spirit  of  thankfulness  will  replace  the  
spirit of gossip, slander, bitterness and anger when we are filled with 
the Spirit. 

772 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
All the verses following 5:18 are characteristics of Spirit-filled people 
(from  5:19  to  6:24).  It  begins  with  thankfulness  and  continues  on  to  
subjection to one another in the church and in home relationships (5:21 
to  6:9);  and  then  to  fighting and overcoming Satanic forces  (6:11).  So  
the  secret  of  our  Christian  walk  and  warfare  on  earth  is  being filled 
with the Holy Spirit. We cannot praise God properly if we are not filled 
with the Spirit. We cannot be godly husbands and wives without being 
filled with the Spirit. We cannot bring up our children properly without 
being filled with the Spirit. And we cannot defeat Satanic forces without 
being filled with the Spirit. Everything in our Christian life is depend-
ent on our being filled with the Spirit.
Home Relationships
In  relation  to  our  home,  we  are  told  here  about  three  relationships  –  
husbands and wives (5:22–33), children and parents (6:1–4) and masters 
and  servants  (6:5–9).  This  last  section  applies  to  servants  working  in  
our homes as well as to those who work in an office – as servants of a 
company  or  the  government,  with  bosses  above  us.  So  these  instruc-
tions tell us how we are to conduct ourselves as masters/mistresses and 
servants – at home, or in an office. We all spend most of our time in two 
places – at home and in our office. A Spirit-filled person will manifest the 
Spirit of Christ at home and at his place of work. It is only with that Spirit 
that we can build the body of Christ.
Ephesians speaks about building the Body of Christ. The fundamental 
principle that underlies our conduct towards one another should be: “Be 
subject to one another in the fear of Christ” (5:21). So just like wives have 
to be subject to their husbands, husbands also have to be subject to their 
wives. In the same way, fathers also have to be subject to their children 
and masters have to be subject to their servants. What does this mean? 
God has drawn a boundary around everyone and we must all respect 
those  boundaries.  That  is  how  we  “honour  all  people”  (1  Peter  2:17). 
Husbands, wives, fathers, children, masters and servants, all have a 
boundary drawn by God around each of them. If you have a servant 
working  in  your  home,  he  has  a  boundary  of  certain  rights  that  you  
cannot violate. For example, he must be given his salary regularly, his 
dignity must be respected, he must not be humiliated when he is being 
corrected, etc. Thus a master must be subject to his servant.
In the same way, when a child is being punished for bad behaviour, his 
dignity must be respected. Fathers must be subject to the boundary 
around their children. As a father, I made it a rule that I would never 
punish my children in the presence of others – whether visitors or their 
brothers – because that would be a double punishment for them – first 

Home Relationships                                                                                                                                 773
Ephesians
the  rod  and  then  the  humiliation  before  others.  And  the  humiliation  
could be more painful for them than the rod. So a child also has a circle 
of dignity around him – and his father must respect that boundary. 
In the same way, a wife has a boundary around her too. She may want 
to  do  things  in  a  certain  way  in  the  kitchen.  That’s  her  sphere.  The  
husband should not interfere in the way she runs her kitchen. I heard 
of a godly man who was very orderly in his ways. But his wife was the 
very opposite. She used to keep the plates and cutlery in her kitchen in 
a very haphazard way – all mixed up. Whenever the husband washed 
the dishes in the kitchen, he was tempted to put away the dishes and 
the  cutlery  in  the  orderly  way  that  his  mind  told  him  to  do  it.  But  
he  knew  that  when  his  wife  saw  the  orderly  kitchen  she  would  get  
discouraged because she could never arrange things that way. So he 
deliberately put away everything in the same slipshod way that his wife 
put them away, so that she would feel quite at home in her kitchen. 
What was the result? They had a slipshod kitchen but glorious fellow-
ship between them!! That godly brother knew how to be subject to his 
wife in reverence for Christ! He was wise and recognised that fellow-
ship between him and his wife was the most important thing. He didn’t 
care whether the plates and cutlery were kept in a haphazard way or 
an orderly way. Some married couples are so foolish that they value a 
neat home more than mutual fellowship. 
Fellowship between parents and children also is more important than 
having  a  neat  and  tidy  home.  We  must  certainly  teach  our  children  to  
be  neat  and  tidy  and  to  put  things  away  in  their  proper  places.  But  
when they are young and play in the house, it will be impossible to keep 
everything neat and tidy at all times. Their home is the only place where 
our children can be free. Personally, I am not at all concerned whether 
others think my house is neatly kept or not. I want my wife and children 
to be happy in my home and I want fellowship with them. That is more 
important to me. Always value fellowship more than having a neat and 
tidy home.
It goes on to say in Ephesians 5 that a wife must recognise the author-
ity  of  her  husband  as  her  head.  God  has  placed  the  husband  as  the  
head – just like the brain in our body. The head (brain) cares for all the 
members  of  the  body  (5:28). Even  so,  the  husband  must  care  for  his  
wife.  Being  the  head  doesn’t  mean  just  giving  orders.  The  head  gives  
commands to the body – it tells the hands, legs and tongue to do various 
things. But the head also cares for the members. If there is the slight-
est injury anywhere in the body, the head feels it immediately and does 
something about it. Even so a husband, as the head, must be sensitive 
to the hurts of his wife. That is how Christ our Head is towards us. I am 
not  referring  merely  to  physical  hurts,  but  to  emotional  hurts  as  well.  

774 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
When the wife is feeling sad or discouraged or hurt about something, the 
husband must sympathise with her and bring healing. A husband who 
is not interested in such care is not fit to be the head. A head who merely 
gives orders is a dictator! A sensitive husband and a submissive wife are 
together a beautiful demonstration to the world of what Christ and the 
church  are.  That  is  the  type  of  home  we  must  all  build.  This  will  take  
time, but we must pursue it with all our hearts.
Children must be brought up to obey their parents (6:1–4). The most 
important thing we have to teach our children is obedience to parents. 
Slaves  are  commanded  to  obey  their  masters,  not  with  eye  service  but  
heartily.  And  masters  are  urged  to  deal  with  their  servants  graciously  
and without partiality (6:5–9).
Spiritual Warfare
In 6:10–18,  we  read  about  spiritual  warfare  –  with  Satan.  Notice  that  
the section on spiritual warfare comes immediately after the section on 
the home. The devil always attacks the home first. We are to stand firm 
against the devil and never fight with flesh and blood (6:12). If you want 
to fight Satan effectively, the very first qualification is that you stop all 
fighting with human beings. The reason why many believers are overcome 
by Satan is because they fight so much with human beings.  I  made  a  
decision many years ago that I would never fight with a human being 
about anything. Then I found I could fight Satan effectively. If you make 
just one decision – never again to fight with man – you will be able to 
overcome  Satan  constantly  and  do  something  useful  with  your  life  for  
God and the church.
The armour is a picture of the many pieces of spiritual equipment God 
has given us. 
First of all, the belt of truth. Truth means sincerity, reality, no hypocrisy 
and no lying. If you are not free from these sins, then you might as well 
forget about fighting Satan. The Devil is a liar – and if you have lying in 
your inner life, Satan will have fellowship with you in your inner man. 
Then  you  won’t  be  able  to  overcome  Satan.  So  make  sure  your  life  is  
transparent and without guile at all times.
The breastplate is righteousness. There are two types of righteousness–
i. the  righteousness  of  Christ  that  is  imputed  to  us,  by  which  we  are  
justified (declared righteous by God Himself); and
ii. the  righteousness  of  Christ  that  is  imparted  to  us,  that  we  partake 
of, through the Holy Spirit, little by little, as we grow spiritually. This 
involves keeping a clear conscience at all times and obeying whatever 
God shows us.

Spiritual Warfare                                                                                                                                       775
Ephesians
Next comes the shoes of readiness to preach the gospel. Did you know 
that  preaching  the  gospel  to  others  is  one  way  by  which  we  can  over-
come Satan? Those who are lazy and never think of sharing the gospel 
with others are overcome by Satan easily. But those who are active and 
serving the Lord are protected. I remember in my younger days the thing 
that protected me from so many temptations that young men face was 
that I spent most of my spare time studying God’s Word, fellowshipping 
with  believers  and  witnessing  for  Him.  I  was  working  in  a  secular  job.  
But twice every week, I would spend a few hours preaching the gospel 
in  the  streets  of  Cochin  (the  city  I  was  living  in).  I  must  have  covered  
almost every major street in that city during the two years I worked in the 
naval base there. Doing evangelism, giving out tracts, sharing the gospel 
with small groups of 4 or 5 people in homes, kept me busy and thereby 
protected  me  from  many  temptations.  Many  temptations  will  come  to  
us if we have plenty of spare time with nothing to do. The idle mind is 
indeed the Devil’s workshop. Our feet must always be ready to give the 
good news of peace with God to others. Try it – and see if it doesn’t help 
you in your battle with Satan.
The fourth piece of armour is the shield of faith. One of Satan’s greatest 
weapons is to make us doubt the love of God. This is the missile that he 
fired at Eve in Eden. He sowed a seed of doubt in her mind suggesting 
that if God really loved her, He would not withhold such lovely fruit from 
her.  She  fell  under  that  missile.  Faith  is  to  believe  that  God  loves  us  
intensely and desires the best for us in every situation; and to know that 
He loves us even when we have failed. Then every fiery missile of Satan 
will be quenched.
The fifth item is the sword of the Spirit. Jesus always overcame Satan by 
quoting God’s Word. He did not enter into a discussion with Satan as Eve 
did. He just told Satan what God had said. Thus He always overcame. 
In times of temptation, we must quote Scriptures such as, “God will not 
allow  me  to  be  tempted  beyond  my  ability”  (1  Corinthians  10:13),  “Sin 
cannot rule over me” (Romans 6:14), “Jesus is able to keep me from falling” 
(Jude 24). Quote God’s Word to Satan and he will flee from you as he did 
from Jesus (James 4:7).
Finally, we must keep our armour well-oiled. How do we do that? “With 
all prayer praying at all times in the Spirit” (6:18). To pray in the Spirit 
does  not  refer  to  praying  in  unknown  languages.  Praying  in  tongues  is  
called praying with our spirit (1 Corinthians 14:15). Praying in the Spirit 
is prayer inspired by the Holy Spirit and not by our flesh. If we allow 
our mind to be renewed by the Spirit and allow our tongue to be under 
His  control,  we  will  pray  in  the  Holy  Spirit.  Paul  says,  “Pray  especially  

776 Through the Bible: In Christ – A Heavenly Life on Earth
Ephesians
for me.” We need to pray especially for God’s servants who are out in the 
forefront fighting the Lord’s battles. 
With the whole armour of God, we can build the Body of Christ in such 
a way that it will be triumphant against the gates of hell.

PHILIPPIANS
Having the Attitude of Christ
T
he theme of Philippians is found in 2:5, “Have this attitude in your-
self  which  was  in  Christ  Jesus.”  Everything  Paul  writes  here  is  
basically around this subject.
There is a lot of emphasis on joy in this letter. “Always offering prayer 
with  joy  in  every  prayer  I  pray  for  you”  (1:4) and “Rejoice  in  the  Lord  
always, and again I say unto you, rejoice” (4:4). 
Philippians was written when Paul was in prison (1:13). It is challeng-
ing to see that Paul wrote so much about joy while he was in a prison. It’s 
one thing to preach about joy when all our circumstances are comfort-
able. It is quite another thing to write about it when our circumstances 
are difficult. Paul’s words here teach us that it is possible for a Christian 
to  have  joy  under  all  circumstances.  That  is  the  mind  and  attitude  of  
Christ. 
Jesus spoke most about joy on the night before He was crucified (in 
John 15 and 16). At the last supper, He told His disciples, “These things 
I  have spoken to you so that your joy may be full.... No man can take 
away your joy ... I want to give you My joy.” He was going to be falsely 
accused and crucified publicly as if He were a criminal in a few hours 
from then. Yet He was going around sharing His joy with others and 
encouraging them!!
This is the mind and attitude of Christ that Paul had. He was full of joy 
in prison. We don’t know whether Paul was only under house arrest as a 
prisoner at the time he wrote this letter (Acts 28:16, 30, 31) or whether he 
was in an actual Roman prison. The Roman prisons of those days were 
dark dungeons full of rats, mosquitoes and creeping insects, where pris-
oners had to sleep on the floor and were given very little food. Whichever 
of  these  two  locations  Paul  may  have  been  in,  the  circumstances  were  

778 Through the Bible: Having the Attitude of Christ
Philippians
definitely not pleasant. Yet in such circumstances, Paul was full of joy. 
He had been imprisoned for preaching the gospel. But he had no tears 
for his own sorrows. He didn’t want any sympathy from anyone either. 
He was full of joy. 
What  an  example  Paul  is  for  Christians  who  live  in  comfort  and  yet  
complain at the smallest inconvenience. How often we see believers trying 
to get sympathy from others just because they are facing a little diffi-
culty or going through a small trial. Paul doesn’t say a word here about 
his sufferings. He says, “I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 
always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all” (1:3, 4). He 
wrote  that  probably  after  a  whole  night  of  being  bitten  by  mosquitoes;  
and he may not have had much warm clothing to cover him either. His 
joy did not come from his circumstances, but from the grace of God that 
he saw in the believers at Philippi.
Many years earlier he had been led by the Lord through a vision to go 
to Philippi (Acts 16:9–12). He had followed that vision and gone there and 
led  people  to  the  Lord  –  and  been  imprisoned  in  Philippi  too.  The  jailer  
who was converted there was probably an elder in the church in Philippi 
now, and he would have told the people then, “I saw this man rejoicing in 
prison.” Paul’s joy came out of a life that was spent usefully for the Lord. 
When you come to the end of your life, the thing that will bring you joy 
is the fact that in the days when God gave you health and strength you 
spent  your  life  serving  the  Lord,  gathering  people  for  His  kingdom  and  
building His church. Think of that now, so that when you come to the end 
of your life, like Paul, you can thank God for what He did with your life.
Treasuring God’s Word and His People in Our Heart
Paul was a great prayer warrior (1:4). He prayed for God’s people all the 
time, everywhere. He did not only preach to them, he prayed for them. 
A true servant of God not only preaches, but also prays for His people.
Paul  says,  “I  am  convinced  that  what  God  has  begun  in  you,  He  will  
complete in the day of Christ. It is right for me to feel this way about you 
because I have you in my heart” (verses 6, 7). If you are a preacher and 
you  want  to  have  a  prophetic  word  for  God’s  people,  then  you  must  
have two things in your heart at all times. You must have God’s Word 
and God’s people in your heart. If you have only God’s word in your 
heart but no love for His people, then God will not give you a word for 
them. In the same way, if you love God’s people but your heart is not 
filled with God’s word, then again, He will not give you a word for them. 
Paul carried believers on his heart, just like Aaron had the names of the 
12 tribes of Israel on the breastplate over his heart. As a human being, 
Paul  could  not  possibly  carry  every  believer  in  the  world  on  his  heart.

Philippians
He carried only those for whom God had given him a responsibility. When 
we have God’s Word and the people He has given us responsibility to care 
for, in our hearts, then even one sentence that we speak will bless them. 
Paul longed for the Philippian Christians with the affection of Christ 
Jesus,  and  he  prayed  that  their  love  would  increase  (1:9).  But  he  also  
prayed  that  their  love  would  increase  in  discernment  (1:9,  10). Love 
without discernment can be dangerous. When our love increases along 
with  spiritual  discernment,  then  we  will  be  able  to  approve  the  things  
that  are  excellent  above  the  things  that  are  good.  As  the  proverb  says,  
“The good is the enemy of the best.” You can choose a way that is good 
and miss out on a way that is far better – one that is excellent.
There are evil things, good things and the very best things. Paul speaks 
in 1 Corinthians 6:12 about unlawful things, lawful things and profitable 
things. The wise man chooses not just what is lawful but what is profit-
able. That is how he becomes spiritual. We must think not just of good 
ways to serve the Lord, but of the very best way to serve Him. We must 
preach not just a good message, but the very best message possible. We 
must think of helping people not just in a good way, but in the very best 
way. This is like a doctor saying, “I want to give this sick person not just 
a good  treatment,  but  the  very  best  treatment  possible.”  That  is  what  
he would say if the patient were his own child. When we love people like 
that, we will always want to give them the very best.
When  I  am  invited  for  a  meal  in  a  home,  and  see  the  dishes  spread  
out on the table, I have often thought of how much effort the housewife 
had put in to produce that meal. And I have said to myself, “When I give 
God’s word to people, I must make the same effort to give God’s people 
the very best.”
Trials Turn to Blessings
Then  he  mentions  his  imprisonment  and  says,  “Don’t  be  discouraged  
about my imprisonment because my imprisonment has turned out for the 
progress of the gospel” (1:12). Paul believed that “all things work together 
for good to those who love God and are called according to His purpose” 
(Romans 8:28). How did Paul’s imprisonment work out for his good? 
Here  is  one  way  in  which  Paul’s  imprisonment  worked  for  our  good.  
Paul was a man who was always on the go. Even when he was old, he 
was  always  travelling.  He  wanted  to  reach  as  many  places  as  possible  
with the gospel, before he left this earth. He had such a close walk with 
God and had been through so many trials that he had become a very rich 
man spiritually. But he had not written down all that he had learnt from 
the Lord. God determined that this man’s spiritual wealth should not go 
down with him into the grave, but be preserved and transmitted for the 
blessing of coming generations. But how could God make Paul slow down 
enough to make him sit down and write all that? He allowed Paul to be 

780 Through the Bible: Having the Attitude of Christ
Philippians
imprisoned!! When Paul was in prison, he could not travel. So he decided 
to spend his time profitably and write letters to the churches and to his 
co-workers. That is how he wrote Philippians, Ephesians and Colossians. 
What was the result? His life and writings became a blessing to millions 
of people for 2000 years. So, Paul’s imprisonment turned out for good.
In the mid-1980s, I was admitted in a hospital for a very minor oper-
ation.  It  was  something  that  the  Lord  could  have  easily  healed  me  of,  
without surgery. But the Lord chose to heal me through surgery. When 
I was in the hospital I asked, “Lord, why have You put me in a  hospital? 
You  could  have  healed  me,  and  I  could  have  been  busy  serving  You  
somewhere at this time.” The Lord said to me, “I could have healed you 
without surgery; but I put you in hospital so that you could lie down for 
a while and listen to what I have to say to you. You are running around 
so much that I hardly get a chance to talk to you.” When I saw that that 
was the reason for my hospitalization, I was happy to lie there for as long 
as the Lord wanted me to, because I wanted to hear Him. One advantage 
of lying in a hospital bed is that you can only look up! As I lay there, the 
Lord began to speak to me day by day. As the Lord spoke, I wrote down 
what  He  said.  That  was  the  only  article  I  ever  wrote  that  was  written  
almost  word  for  word,  as  the  Lord  spoke  to  me.  I  have  published  it  as  
a small booklet titled, “Fifty Marks of Godly Men”. It can also be found 
under  the  chapter  heading  “God  Needs  Men”  in  my  books  “New  Wine  
in  New  Wineskins”  and  “Principles  of  Serving  God”,  God  has  used  that  
booklet around the world in many countries. I consider it to be the most 
important of all my writings. But I might never have written it, if the Lord 
had not put me in a hospital-bed.
God stops us at times from doing things by sickness or by imprison-
ment in order to make us do something for Him that we would never 
have done otherwise. So we can be thankful whenever God stops us 
in our tracks. He has a purpose in it, for “the stops of good men are 
directed by the Lord, just as much as their steps” (Psalm 37:23).
Here is a second way in which Paul’s imprisonment worked for good. 
He says, “My imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known 
throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else” (1:13); and 
later, “All  the  Christians  here  want  to  be  remembered  to  you,  especially  
those who work in Caesar’s palace” (Living). How did people in Caesar’s 
palace get converted? Because Paul preached the gospel to those prison 
guards  when  they  were  chained  to  him.  In  those  days,  prisoners  were  
chained  to  a  prison  guard  to  prevent  them  from  escaping.  During  the  
8  hours  that  a  Roman  soldier  was  chained  to  him,  Paul  preached  the  
gospel to him. The guard could not go away!! He had to listen. The guard 
may have repented and received Christ as his Saviour. When his 8-hour 
shift was over, another guard replaced him for the next 8 hours; and Paul

Philippians
started preaching the gospel to him!! Thus a number of the guards were 
converted  and  very  soon  there  was  a  little  church  meeting  in  Caesar’s  
palace!!
Paul’s imprisonment resulted therefore in the Scriptures being written 
and in people (who would never come to a meeting) being converted. And 
that was not all. Because of Paul’s imprisonment, many believers became 
more courageous to preach (1:14). Timid believers got rid of their fear of 
preaching the gospel and became bold.
But there were some people there who were jealous of Paul and who 
had  a  spirit  of  competition  and  strife  –  just  as  there  are  today.  They  
wanted to preach to show off their own gift; but they never got the chance 
to do so when Paul was around. But now that Paul was in prison, they 
could  preach.  They  didn’t  have  an  anointing,  but  they  had  a  lust  to  
preach. What was Paul’s attitude when he heard about this? He rejoiced 
that Christ was being preached and left it to God to judge them for their 
wrong motives (1:15).
Today,  we  see  many  preachers  preaching  Christ  in  order  to  make  
money. God may use them to save some souls and even to heal some sick 
people; but He will finally send them to hell for preaching about Christ 
in order to make money (Matthew 7:22, 23 makes that clear). There are 
preachers who listen to my sermons on the Internet and read my books 
only to find points for their sermons – to gain honour for themselves. 
Some souls are blessed by their preaching – and so I rejoice. God will, 
however,  judge  them  for  their  wrong  motives  one  day.  An  unconverted  
person  may  distribute  gospel  tracts  and  people  can  be  saved  through  
those  tracts.  But  the  man  who  distributed  the  tracts  goes  to  hell.  We  
don’t have to judge them. God will judge them in the final day. He will not 
spare any man who preaches the gospel with wrong motives. 
Paul says in 1:21, “For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain”. If he 
died, he would be with the Lord immediately. If he continued to live, 
he would have some more years of fruitful labour in Christ’s vineyard. 
Both options appealed to Paul equally. So he did not know which to 
choose.  He  finally  felt  that  he  should  live  on  a  little  longer  to  lead 
believers into a godly life. God allowed him to live a few more years for 
the sake of those believers who still needed to be established, and for a 
few more letters that needed to be written to complete Scripture. Later 
on, when Paul wrote 2 Timothy, he knew that the time had come for 
him to leave the earth.
In 1:27, Paul says, “Please conduct yourself in a manner worthy of the 
gospel of Christ, so that whether I am in prison or I come to see you, I will 
always hear that you are standing firm in one spirit, one in mind, striving 
together.” This was Paul’s burden – unity – as we can see in the different 
expressions he uses here – one mind, one spirit, and striving together.

782 Through the Bible: Having the Attitude of Christ
Philippians
In 1:28, he urges them not to be alarmed because of their enemies, for 
their “being at rest” when persecuted would be an evidence of their own 
salvation  and  a  sign  of  destruction  to  their  enemies!  When  Pilate  told  
Jesus, “Don’t You know that I have power to crucify You?” Jesus replied, 
“You  can  have  no  power  against  Me,  unless  My  Father  gives  it  to  you”  
(John 19:10, 11). Jesus was not alarmed. And if a time comes in your life 
or mine, when we have to stand like that before some secular authority, 
let us make the same “confession that Jesus made before Pontius Pilate”: 
“You can have no power over me except what my heavenly Father gives 
you.” Such a confession will be a sign of destruction to our enemies. God 
has given us two privileges (1:29) – “to believe in Christ” and “to suffer for 
His sake”. Both of these go together.
Freedom from Selfishness and Pride
In Chapter 2, Paul continues with the same theme of unity (as in 1:27). 
In 2:2,  he  uses  four  expressions  of  unity:  “Be  of  the  same  mind,  same  
love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.” Then he goes on to tell them 
how to have this unity. How the Body of Christ can be built and grow in 
unity: Never do anything from selfishness or pride (2:3). The two sins that 
will remain with us in some degree until we die are selfishness and pride. 
We may overcome unclean thoughts, the love of money, getting offended, 
slandering, gossiping, bitterness and an unforgiving spirit – over a period 
of time. But selfishness and pride are very deeply rooted in us. They are 
like two huge onions. When we peel off one layer, we find another layer 
underneath. And when we peel off that layer, we discover yet another one 
under that.
Selfishness is a primary characteristic of Adam’s race, and is seen in 
the way we do things, in the way we spend our money and our time, 
etc. As we get light on our selfishness, we can cleanse away a little 
bit  at  a  time.  Gradually,  we  will  become  more  and  more  loving  and  
Christlike, over a period of time. If you are not getting more and more 
light on your selfishness, that would be one of the clearest indications 
that you are not walking in the light with the Lord. And you will be a 
hindrance to the unity of Christ’s Body.
The second characteristic of Adam’s race is pride. It could be pride in 
our appearance or our intelligence. After we have overcome our pride 
in these matters, we stand in danger of spiritual pride. That is a huge 
onion. Often we get light on our spiritual pride after we have done some-
thing for the Lord. It could be after a testimony that we gave, where 
we didn’t give God all the glory. If we repent and cleanse ourselves, we 
would have peeled off one more layer of the onion of spiritual pride.

Freedom from Selfishness and Pride                                                                                                     783
Philippians
Those  who  are  faithful  in  peeling  off  the  onions  of  selfishness  and 
spiritual pride, will gradually become more and more one with each other 
in Christ’s Body.
In  this  connection,  Paul  goes  on  to  say,  “Have  this  mind  (attitude)  in  
you which was in Christ Jesus” (2:5). You can live all your life with just 
this one verse. You don’t need any other verse in the Bible for transfor-
mation. In every situation ask yourself, “Do I have the attitude of Christ 
here?” Judge your past actions by this question, “Did I have the attitude 
of Christ there?” There is a lot of selfishness in the attitude of the race of 
Adam to their own conveniences. We like to choose the best bed, the best 
food and the biggest slice of cake.” Children are like that in a crude way. 
As we grow older, we avoid crude actions like that, because it would spoil 
our testimony; but we could still be like that inside! 
What  is  the  attitude  of  Jesus?  While  in  heaven,  He  thought  of  the  
pathetic condition of people on earth who did not have all that He had; 
and  His  attitude  was,  “I  want  them  also  to  have  what  I  have  here  in  
heaven.” That was the attitude of Christ. So, our attitude towards other 
people should be, “I have forgiveness of sins, but they don’t have it. I have 
victory over sin, but those believers don’t have it. I must offer these to 
them”.  This  can  apply  to  the  necessities of  life  on  earth  too.  On  a  cold  
night, when you cover yourself with a blanket, think about whether the 
other  believers  in  your  church  have  blankets  too.  That’s  the  Spirit  of  
Christ. When you eat food, think of your fellow believers in your church, 
and ask yourself if they all have food to eat. That is the mind of Christ.
When Christ came to earth, we see three steps of humility that He took. 
First, although He was equal with the Father, He gave up those privileges 
and became a Man. Secondly, as a Man, He became a Servant of all men. 
Thirdly, He went lower still and died like a criminal (2:6–8). These are the 
three secrets of the Christian life: Humility, Humility, Humility.
He knew that He could help people only if He served them, and not if 
He was like a king over them. That’s why He refused to be a king, when 
the people tried to make Him one. We may think, that as a king, one 
can help many people. But Jesus has shown us by His life that it is 
only a servant who can help people. So he refused to rule over others. 
He spent all His life serving others, never taking any position or title. 
He  called  Himself  the  ‘Son  of  Man’  –  meaning  “an  ordinary  man”.  He  
was God Almighty, even when on earth; but He would still say that He 
was only an ordinary man. He had the mind of a servant.
There  is  a  difference  between  serving  and  being  a  servant.  We  have  
probably  seen  photographs  in  newspapers  of  some  Cabinet  Minister  
sweeping  a  road,  inaugurating  a  ‘Cleanliness  Campaign”.  He  sweeps  
the road for 5 seconds and waits for the newspapers to take his photo-
graph. Is he a servant? No. He is only acting like a servant for 5 seconds 

784 Through the Bible: Having the Attitude of Christ
Philippians
to  get  a  reputation.  There  is  a  world  of  difference  between  serving  and  
being  a  servant.  We  can  serve  for  man’s  honour.  But  being  a  servant 
means having an attitude of mind where we always think of ourselves as 
servants.
This is how the Lord once taught me this truth. I spent eleven years 
in the military where punctuality was extremely important. If a parade 
was at 6.30 in the morning, we had to be there at 6.25 and not at 6.31. 
If anyone came at 6.31, he would be taught such a lesson that he would 
never come late again for the rest of his life! When I became an elder in 
a church, I saw that more than half the people in the church never came 
on time for the Sunday morning meetings. This disturbed me consider-
ably and I would try every possible exhortation to get people to come on 
time; but nothing worked. Then the Lord showed me that I was acting 
like a master in the church and not as a servant. A servant in a palace, 
for example, has to be on time at the breakfast table always. But the king 
and queen can come whenever they like. The Lord told me to be a servant 
in His church and to treat the others as more important than me. Then I 
came to rest. I realised then that I needed to have the attitude of a servant 
and not just serve. That liberated me; and I was no longer disturbed by 
the lack of punctuality that I saw in others. I let “the kings and queens” 
come whenever they liked. Gradually, some of them may become serv-
ants – and start coming on time!
Jesus  humbled  Himself  to  be  a  servant  –  and  God  exalted  Him.  The  
more you humble yourself, the more God will exalt you – spiritually. He 
won’t exalt you over people but over sin, the world, and the devil. 
In 2:14, we are told to do everything without grumbling or complaining. 
This looks like an impossible standard and so most Christians ignore 
this command. But it can be done with God’s power. In the previous 
two verses (2:12, 13), we are told that God first works within us and 
we have to then work it out. We cannot produce the humility and the 
unselfish love of Christ on our own. God has to work inside us first. 
And He does. But then we have to work it out in our daily situations. 
The  Holy  Spirit  continually  works  within  us  –  and  we  have  to  work  
out what He works in. Thus we will grow in likeness to Christ day by 
day (2 Corinthians 4:16). And thus we will be able to live without ever 
grumbling or complaining at any time.
Paul  then  quotes  the  examples  of  two  of  his  co-workers  –  Timothy  
(2:19–21)  and  Epaphroditus  (2:25) who manifested this unselfish atti-
tude of Christ in their lives. Paul said that among all his coworkers who 
were with him then, he could only choose Timothy to send to Philippi, 
because all the others sought their own. The others were all born-again 
Christians  who  had  been  baptised  in  the  Holy  Spirit.  They  spoke  in  
tongues  and  could  preach  well.  They  even  had  a  passion  for  souls.  

Everything Outside of Christ is Rubbish                                                                                                785
Philippians
But  they  still  sought  their  own  gain  –  some  honour,  some  money  and  
some comfort for themselves. Paul, being a spiritual man, could discern 
that these good brothers were not all of the same quality. Timothy alone 
stood  out  as  totally  unselfish.  We  find  the  same  today  among  most 
Christian workers.
In every group of Christians, we will find good  brothers  and  sisters  
and excellent brothers and sisters. The excellent ones are those who do 
not seek their own. Most Christian workers (whom I have met) appear to 
me, to be seeking their own. They are not like Timothy. God is looking 
for those who seek the things of Christ first and foremost. To such He 
gives revelation and through such He does an eternal work. Timothy and 
Epaphroditus were like that. Epaphroditus was sick to the point of death 
while serving God, but yet his life radiated the glory of Christ.
In 3:1, Paul says, “To write the same things again is no trouble to me, 
and it is a safeguard for you.” Paul was not ashamed of repetition in his 
writings.  He  sought  the  good  of  people  and  not  his  own  honour.  Most  
preachers  will  not  repeat  a  sermon,  because  they  seek  the  honour  of  
men.  They  keep  a  list  of  their  sermons  and  make  a  note  of  where  all  
they have preached it, so that they don’t repeat that sermon anywhere!! 
Such people are professional preachers and not prophets. The old cove-
nant  prophets  repeated  their  sermons  numerous  times,  because  they  
were more interested in getting people to obey God than to get honour or 
money for themselves. Paul repeated his exhortations, because he saw 
that people needed to hear it.
Everything Outside of Christ is Rubbish
In 3:2, Paul says, “Beware of the dogs. Beware of the evil workers. Beware 
of the false circumcision, people who believe in the external circumcision. 
We are the true circumcision.” Circumcision – the cutting off of the flesh 
– symbolised “no confidence in the flesh and glorying only in Christ” (3:3). 
Paul goes on to say that he had many things to boast of, in terms of the 
flesh – he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees and blameless according to 
the  righteousness  of  the  law.  That  means  that  from  his  childhood  he  
had faithfully kept the first 9 commandments and lived an upright life. 
(No-one in the old covenant could keep the 10
th
 commandment – Romans 
7:7–9). But when he found Christ he discovered that all his “human good-
ness” was actually garbage – rubbish.
I  often  use  the  words  “garbage”  and  “rubbish”  when  referring  to  the  
worthless things of this earth. But that word did not originate with me. 
Paul used it first here (3:8)! He said that everything on earth, including 
human  righteousness,  was  actually  garbage  and  rubbish  compared  to  
Christ. Have you seen that yourself? Have you seen that all the money 
in the world is rubbish compared to Christ? Have you seen that all the 
honour  of  man  is  rubbish  compared  to  Christ?  Have  you  seen  that  all  

786 Through the Bible: Having the Attitude of Christ
Philippians
earthly comfort is rubbish compared to Christ? Doing God’s will, being 
in the place where God wants you to be, growing in Christlikeness and 
fulfilling the ministry that God has for you – those are the only things 
that matters from eternity’s standpoint.
If other Christian workers are honoured and you are not, what does 
it matter? Our calling is to share the reproach of Christ. Earthly honour 
is rubbish in any case. Are you jealous that another Christian worker is 
getting more money than you and living a more comfortable life? Then 
you haven’t seen money as rubbish. All he has is a little more garbage 
than you! Do you feel sad about that? It was because Paul saw the worth-
lessness of all these things that he was such a free man – undisturbed by 
earthly pleasure, wealth and honour – and free to serve the Lord without 
any hindrance. 
We cannot serve the Lord faithfully until we see that everything outside 
of  Jesus  Christ  is  garbage.  We  certainly  need  money  to  live  on  this  
earth. As servants of the Lord, we can receive money by working with 
our hands or as gifts (that we never ask for or seek) and we can use it 
for our life on this earth – for paying for food, clothing and housing and 
for the education of our children. But if we compare our lot with that 
of  others  in  money  matters,  or  if  we  are  “calculating”  in  our  attitude  
towards  money,  or  if  we  make  money  a  factor  in  our  service  for  the  
Lord, then we have completely missed God’s way. Money must be our 
servant and never our master.
The  streets  of  heaven  are  paved  with  gold.  Gold  is  under  our  feet  in  
heaven. That is where money should be for every true servant of the Lord 
on earth too. On earth, they put gold on their heads. If you can put gold 
under your feet now, then you are ready for heaven. But if you still have 
gold  in  your  head  (mind)  all  the  time,  then  you  are  not  ready  to  go  to  
heaven yet. You better learn quickly to put money in its proper place; and 
likewise with honour. Worldly honour or dishonour should be exactly the 
same to you – garbage!
Paul  goes  on  to  speak  about  his  great  longing  in  life.  It  was  not  to  
become a famous preacher or to be well known. All that was garbage to 
him. His earnest desire was to know Christ more, to know more of the 
power  of  His  resurrection  and  more  of  the  fellowship  of  His  sufferings  
(3:10). He goes on to say that he hadn’t attained to all that he wanted to 
– he had not yet reached the perfection of Christ (3:12). But in another 
sense,  he  says  that  he  was  perfect  (verse  15).  And  he  says  that  there  
were some others too who were perfect like him. He urges the Philippians 
to make such people their example. Have you understood this paradox 
–  “Perfect  –  yet  not  perfect”?  That  is  the  paradox  of  true  spirituality.  
Many Christians are afraid of the word ‘perfection,’ because they haven’t 
studied the New Testament carefully. There is a perfection that we can 

Strength for All Things in Christ                                                                                                              787
Philippians
never attain to until Christ returns, but there IS a perfection that we can 
have while we are on earth.
The  perfection  we  can  have  on  earth  is  a  perfect  conscience  –  every  
matter  set  right  with  God  and  with  man  (Acts  24:16),  every  known  sin  
confessed and cleansed in the blood of Jesus Christ (1 John 1:7, 9), every 
restitution made, every debt repaid, every apology made, etc. Then our 
conscience is perfect. This is the perfection that we can have. The perfec-
tion that we cannot have is total likeness to Christ. Paul acknowledged 
that he had not become totally perfect like Christ – but he was pressing 
on towards that goal. That perfection will come when Christ returns to 
earth. But that goal is like the peak of a mountain. When we are born 
again, we are at the foot of that mountain. Becoming totally like Christ is 
the top of the mountain. Every day we must climb a little higher towards 
that peak. Thus we press on to perfection. We are not to sit at the foot of 
the mountain all our life. We must press on.
So what Paul is saying here is that we must make those who live with a 
perfect conscience at all times as our example (verse 17) – and not others, 
since  most  Christians  do  not  walk  like  this.  Instead,  they  are  enemies  
of  the  cross  of  Christ  (verse  18).  Their  god  is  their  stomach  (verse  19). 
How do we know whether our stomach (our appetite) is our god? If the 
food your wife has cooked is not tasty one day, and you get upset with 
your wife for that, then your taste buds are your god! If that is the case, 
then when you pray before eating your food, you are only imagining that 
you are praying to the Lord Jesus. You are actually bowing down before 
your taste buds. Don’t make your taste buds your god. Don’t make your 
stomach  your  god.  Let  Christ  alone  be  your  God.  When  you  get  good  
food, praise the Lord. If one day the food does not taste so good, praise 
the Lord again. If one day the breakfast is not ready on time before you 
go to work, don’t get upset with your wife. Instead say, “Perhaps the Lord 
wanted  me  to  fast  this  morning.  Maybe  that  is  why  He  permitted  the  
breakfast not to be ready. Perhaps the Lord sees that I am a great lover of 
food and He wants me to be free from it.” So give thanks and go to work 
without breakfast! Don’t make your stomach your god – because we are 
our citizens of heaven (verse 20).
Strength for All Things in Christ
In 4:4, the Holy Spirit urges us, “Rejoice in the Lord ALWAYS” – not some-
times  or  even  most  of  the  time,  but  all  the  time.  This  verse  challenged  
me many years ago. I acknowledged that this verse was not true in my 
life; and then I asked the Lord to make it true in my life. Do you want 
to be healthy only sometimes, or most of the times, or all the time? We 
all want to be healthy all the time. So do you want to rejoice sometimes, 
most of the time, or all the time? You say, “Is that possible?” By the grace 
of God it IS possible. God would not have given us such a command if 

788 Through the Bible: Having the Attitude of Christ
Philippians
He knew it was impossible. If this is not yet true in our lives, then let us 
be honest and tell the Lord so. Ask him to fill you with the Holy Spirit and 
to  teach  you  that  everything  in  the  world  is  garbage  outside  of  Christ.  
Then you WILL rejoice all the time. A lot of the grumbling, complaining 
and  murmuring  found  among  believers  is  because  they  have  not  seen  
everything in the world as garbage, outside of Christ – then it is indeed 
impossible to rejoice always! Paul was a prisoner in a rotten dungeon of 
a prison in Rome when he wrote those words. If he could rejoice in such 
circumstances, then why can’t we?
Then Paul says one more challenging thing: “Be anxious about nothing” 
(4:6).  That  is  yet  another  mountain-peak  to  climb.  Anxiety  comes  so  
easily  to  all  of  us.  It  comes  when  you  don’t  have  enough  money  to  
meet  your  needs  till  the  end  of  the  month.  When  your  children  are  
late in coming back from school, you begin to be anxious. If you are 
a young person, and growing older, but see no prospects of marriage, 
you can become anxious. Many things can cause us anxiety. We may 
never reach the peak of this mountain on earth. But we should press 
on, so that our faith and confidence in God grows, so that whenever 
we  are  anxious  about  anything,  we  take  it  to  the  Lord  in  prayer.  As  
the  old  hymn  says,  “O  what  peace  we  often  forfeit,  O  what  needless  
pain we bear, all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.” 
And along with our prayer, we should add thanksgiving. Thanksgiving 
means, “Lord, I thank You that You have heard my prayer.” Then you 
are certain that your request has reached heaven. Then the Lord will 
take care of it. Once you thank God, you can rise from prayer, without 
anxiety.  If  the  anxiety  still  remains,  it  could  be  because  you  did  not  
conclude your prayer with thanksgiving.
We are exhorted further to always set your minds on the things that 
are excellent (4:8). Paul then tells us that in his own life he has learnt the 
secret of being content with much or little, whatever God, in His wisdom, 
chose to give him (4:11, 12). This is indeed a secret – for most Christians 
have not learnt it.
Paul  then  makes  this  triumphant  declaration:  “I  can  do  all  things  
through  Christ  Who  strengthens  me”  (4:13).  As  Christ  strengthens  us,  
we will be able to rejoice always and be anxious for nothing. We cannot 
attain  to  this  life  on  our  own,  but  we  can,  through  the  power  that  
Christ gives.
The Philippian church was the only church that supported Paul finan-
cially and from whom Paul felt free to receive gifts (4:14–18). And so to 
such a generous church, Paul says, “My God will supply all your needs 
according  to  His  riches  in  glory  through  Christ  Jesus”  (4:19).  God  will  
supply us with everything that we need to live a godly life. This promise 
is  not  talking  about  earthly  things  primarily,  but  about  God’s  riches  

Strength for All Things in Christ                                                                                                              789

in glory. He will give us all that we need to overcome sin and Satan, and 
to live a life of continuous joy and peace, filled and anointed with the 
Holy Spirit. He will also supply our material necessities. It does not speak 
here about luxuries, but only of our needs. Remember however that this 
promise was given to those who had been generous to God’s work first of 
all. From such believers God will withhold nothing. He will give them the 
very best – and all that He has.



COLOSSIANS
Christ in You – The Hope of Glory
C
olosse  was  a  place  that  Paul  had  never  visited.  It  is  probable,  
however, that when Paul was in Ephesus for three years, one of his 
coworkers, Epaphras, may have gone across and planted a church 
in Colosse (1:7). So Paul knew a lot about that church from Epaphras, 
and so he had a very real interest in the developments in that particular 
church. We could say that Paul’s letter to the Colossians is like a twin 
letter to his letter to the Ephesians.
Jesus – God and Man
In Ephesians, the theme was ‘In Christ’. In Colossians, the theme is ‘Christ 
in you’. We find that in 1:27: “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” We read in 
Ephesians about our position in Christ that has made us rich with every 
spiritual blessing in the heavenly places. In Colossians, we see the other 
side of that truth – that because Christ is in us, He can manifest through 
us the same heavenly life that He manifested when He was on earth. So 
we  could  say  in  another  way  that  the  main  emphasis  in  Colossians  is  
that the fullness of God dwelt in Christ in bodily form (Colossians 2:9). 
The fullness of God dwelling in a human body was first seen in Jesus 
Christ  and  now  Christ  dwelling  in  our  human  body  can  manifest  that  
same divine life. That is the theme of this letter.
In  this  letter,  we  see  Paul  correcting  two  extremes  of  wrong  doctrine  
concerning the human body. These two extremes are found in many false 
religions also.
One teaching was that the human body was essentially evil. So it had 
to  be  suppressed  and  treated  roughly,  if  one  was  to  become  spiritual.  
This teaching is found today among those who seek to be holy through 
yoga, asceticism and bodily discipline. Paul deals with this in the latter 
part of Colossians 2. 

792 Through the Bible: Christ in You – The Hope of Glory
Colossians
The other teaching was that the human body was unimportant, since 
the  main  thing  was  the  human  spirit;  and  so  bodily  lusts  could  be  
indulged in to any extent. This led to immorality and fornication in the 
name of religion. You would have heard of temple prostitutes in heathen 
religions. 
Throughout the centuries many religions have had these two extreme 
attitudes to the human body. Both these teachings despise the human 
body.
Because  of  this  teaching,  some  in  Colosse  could  not  believe  that  
Almighty God could possibly come in a human body like ours and walk 
as a man on this earth. Even today, many Christians who do believe that 
Jesus Christ came as a Man, still do not find any practical application of 
that truth in their daily lives on earth. 
Jesus Christ is God – and always was God. Even when He was on earth 
He was still God. But He also became totally a Man. Both these truths 
are equally important. If we lose sight of either of them and their prac-
tical application, in that measure our Christian life will suffer loss. 
If we don’t believe that Jesus Christ is God, then our sins cannot be 
forgiven, for no-one other than God Himself can take the punishment 
for the sins of all humanity on the cross.
If we don’t believe that Jesus Christ became a Man like us, “made in 
ALL  things  like  His  brothers”  (Hebrews  2:17),  then  we  cannot  follow  
Him, for we cannot follow someone who was only God. But Jesus gave 
up His privileges as God when He lived on earth with our limitations, 
and that is why we can follow him (Philippians 2:5).
Sin is not something found in the body. It is not because you have a 
body that you sin. Jesus had a body like ours. His body came from his 
mother, through “the seed of David” (2 Timothy 2:8 - KJV – “the sperm of 
David” is the literal Greek word there). But even though He had a human 
body like ours, there was never any sin in that body – no conscious sin 
and no unconscious sin. He was totally pure from birth till death.
On the other hand, Satan who has no body is full of sin.
So we see that sin has nothing to do with the human body. We make 
the choice ourselves in the moments of temptation – whether to allow 
sin to be manifested through our body, or the life of God and purity to 
be manifested through our body.
Colossians  deals  with  the  fullness  of  God  dwelling  in  bodily  form  in  
Christ,  and  Christ  now  dwelling  in  us.  Chapter  1  emphasises  the  pre-  
eminence of Christ in creation and in redemption. First of all, Paul thanks 

Jesus – God and Man                                                                                                                               793
Colossians
God for them and prays for them, like he always does for all the churches 
that he wrote to. “From the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray 
for  you”  (1:9).  Paul  was  praying  here  for  Christians  he  had  never  met  
(1:7,  8).  His  coworker  Epaphras  was  the  one  who  had  established  this  
church. He told Paul about the believers in Colosse. 
An  interesting  Bible  study  that  you  could  do  would  be  to  study  the  
prayers of the Apostle Paul. There are many prayers of Paul from Romans 
to 2  Timothy. You  will  notice  that  in  all  his  prayers  he  prayed  only  for  
spiritual things for the believers. He never prayed that Christians would 
become rich, or that they would have good houses to live in or that they 
would  advance  in  their  jobs.  He  never  prayed  for  such  material  things  
for any of them. He always prayed for eternal, spiritual things. Paul was 
gripped in his heart with the fact that everything on earth was only for a 
short period. 
To use an illustration: Our life on earth can be compared to a train- 
journey to eternity. The train-journey is only for a short period. Then we 
reach our final destination. If we are wise, we will concentrate more on 
having a good place to live in, at our final destination than on having a 
comfortable train journey. So Paul prayed for believers that they would 
live on earth in such a way that when they get into eternity they would 
have no regrets.
He prayed that they would be “filled with the knowledge of His will in 
all spiritual wisdom and understanding” (1:9). Or in other words, “I am 
praying that you will look at things from God’s point of view” (J.B. Philips 
paraphrase). Look at your physical body from God’s view point and don’t 
despise it or indulge it. Jesus came in a human body. So don’t despise 
your body. Look at everything in life from God’s point of view. That is a 
good prayer to pray for ourselves: “Lord, help me to see everything that 
happens in my life from Your viewpoint.” How do you look at the circum-
stances that came into your life, that sickness, that thorn in the flesh, 
that  person  who  is  treating  you  badly?  Look  at  all  of  them  from  God’s  
viewpoint. Did it surprise God when that thing happened to you? No. It 
didn’t. But it did surprise you, because you are a human being limited by 
time and space. But remember that God was not surprised. So when you 
move up to God’s viewpoint, you will find that your heart comes to rest 
about many things that would otherwise bother you, if you had looked at 
them from an earthly viewpoint.
If you can build a church where people have learned to look at things 
from  God’s  viewpoint,  there  you  have  a  spiritual  church.  A  church  is  
not  spiritual  just  because  it  engages  in  a  lot  of  evangelism  and  social  
work.  We  must  teach  everyone  to  look  at  things  from  God’s  viewpoint.  
Only  then  can  we  walk  “in  a  manner  worthy  of  the  Lord  and  bear  fruit  
in every good work” (1:10). Paul then speaks about “being strengthened 
with power according to His glorious might” (verse 11) which is a referring 
to a life filled with the Holy Spirit.

794 Through the Bible: Christ in You – The Hope of Glory
Colossians
1:15  is  one  of  the  clearest  descriptions  in  the  New  Testament  of  the  
fact that Jesus Christ was God when He was on earth (in case anyone 
doubts that). “He is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all crea-
tion.” That means He was God in human form – the One Who began (or 
created) everything that has been created, Who existed before anything 
was  created  and  who  created  all  things  (as clarified in 1:15–17).  The  
“fleshly body” of Christ is emphasised in 1:22, because some people then 
said that He did not have a fleshly body.
Filling Up the Sufferings of Christ
Paul  says  in  1:24,  “I  do  my  share  on  behalf  of  His  body,  which  is  the  
church, in filling up that which is lacking in Christ’s affliction.” What is it 
that is lacking in Christ’s sufferings? Didn’t He say on the cross that it 
was finished? There is a great truth here.
We read of some of Jesus’ physical sufferings in the gospels. But He 
suffered in His soul also in ways that are not recorded in Scripture. When 
He said, “It is finished” on the cross, He had not only finished paying the 
price for man’s sins, He had also finished overcoming the entire range of 
temptations that any man can ever face. He had been tempted in all points 
as we are and overcome (Hebrews 4:15). In every temptation, we have the 
option of yielding to the temptation and choosing the way of pleasure, or 
resisting the temptation and choosing the way of suffering (the opposite 
of pleasure). Jesus consistently chose the way of suffering and “suffered 
in the flesh” (1 Peter 4:1). Thus He became the Forerunner for us. Now we 
have to follow in His footsteps and become mini- forerunners for others. 
When we are tempted to sin, the Holy Spirit leads us to choose the same 
way of suffering in our flesh that Jesus went through. What Paul was 
saying in 1:24 was that he had not yet completed all the sufferings in his 
life (in temptation) that Jesus had completed.
Jesus also suffered externally in many ways because He stood for the 
truth. If you take a glass to represent suffering, then in Jesus’ case, all 
the suffering He chose to go through in His life time filled up that glass 
completely. Finally, on the cross He said, “It is finished.” Now we follow 
in Jesus’ footsteps, and we too have a body like He had. The Holy Spirit 
has to do the same work in us – of filling up that glass. When we are 
born  again,  our  glass  is  empty  because  we  have  suffered  nothing  for  
Christ. Gradually as time goes on, this glass begins to fill up with what 
we suffer for Christ’s sake. The same Christ who suffered on earth dwells 
in us now and He wants to take us through the same sufferings He went 
through, but now in our body. The servant is not greater than his master. 
All His sufferings have to be completed now, in our body. That is actually 
a great privilege. Paul said that his glass had not yet been filled up.
Many  Christians  don’t  understand  that  when  they  go  through  any  
suffering, they are fellowshipping with Christ in His sufferings. I am not 

Filling Up the Sufferings of Christ                                                                                                           795
Colossians
talking about the sufferings we get because we do something foolish or 
sinful.  Jesus  never  did  anything  sinful  or  foolish.  He  suffered  because  
His way of life was totally contrary to this world. His entire ministry was 
in constant conflict with the Bible scholars and theologians of His day. 
They hated Him and finally killed Him. 
It is the same today. If we are true disciples of Christ, we will find 
ourselves in conflict with the entire religious system of this world and 
also with a lot of so-called Christian theology and religion. We will find 
ourselves in conflict just like Jesus did – with people who don’t know 
God,  but  who  are  very  religious.  Who  were  the  ones  who  called  Jesus  
‘Beelzebul’? They were not the Greeks or the Romans. They were people 
who  had  a  Bible  (the  Old  Testament  at  that  time).  Who  were  the  ones  
who  persecuted  Jesus  the  most  and  killed  Him?  They  were  religious  
people with a Bible. So if we are going to fill up the afflictions of Christ, 
we will find religious people with a Bible afflicting us too, because they 
don’t know God. Jesus said they hated and persecuted Him because they 
didn’t know His Father. They will do the same thing to us. 
Paul says, “I rejoice in these sufferings, because I am doing my share.” 
Each of us have a share for the sake of this Body of Christ, the church. 
First, Jesus suffered in His physical body. Now He has to suffer in His 
spiritual body, the church. You have your share and I have mine in these 
sufferings. I cannot fulfil your share and you cannot fulfil mine. When 
you  go  through  some  suffering,  I  can’t  be  faithful  for  you. You  have  to  
be faithful yourself, when you suffer because of your relatives or neigh-
bours, or when you are persecuted or thrown out of your house because 
you  want  to  follow  Jesus.  These  are  a  part  of  the  sufferings  of  Christ.  
Rejoice at that time and say, “Lord, thank You for giving me the privilege 
of filling up a little bit of Your afflictions for the sake of the church which 
is Your body.” That is how we will have a ministry to others and that is 
how we can build the church.
That is why this is called a part of “the fellowship of Christ’s sufferings”. 
Christ gained nothing for Himself through His sufferings. But we gained 
a  lot.  When  we  are  in  fellowship  with  Christ’s  sufferings,  we  ourselves  
gain  nothing  from  it.  It  is  for  the  sake  of  the  church.  Others  will  gain  
through our sufferings. Are you willing for that? I hope we will say, “Yes, 
Lord. I am willing. I want to be in fellowship with Your mind and Your 
spirit and Your attitude. I want to suffer so that others will gain some-
thing through my suffering.”
Have you seen how sugarcane is crushed in a grinder? They put those 
sugarcane sticks into the grinder and grind it and the juice comes out. 
After this is done a few times, one would think that all the juice has come 
out of those sticks. But, no! They put it back in again – and some more 
juice comes out. For whose benefit is it being crushed? For somebody 
else to drink it. That’s how God makes us also a blessing to others.  We  
are crushed and squeezed in the circumstances and trials of life, and we 

796 Through the Bible: Christ in You – The Hope of Glory
Colossians
humble ourselves and accept them joyfully, and from that crushing, the 
radiance  and  beauty  and  aroma  of  Christ  come  forth.  That  is  the  only  
way we can be a blessing to others.
In 1:28, Paul says that with this experience of Christ’s sufferings, “we 
proclaim  Christ,  admonishing  every  man  and  teaching  every  man  with  
all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ.” This 
is  both  prophecy  and  teaching  –  with  all  wisdom.  Paul’s  ultimate  goal  
was to “present every man perfect in Christ.” If Paul had a church of 100 
people, he was going to do everything possible to make sure that all those 
100 people – every brother and sister – would become perfect in Christ. 
He was going to exhort them, admonish them, and teach them with all 
wisdom, because one day he would have to present them to God.
There  are  very  few  pastors  and  shepherds  who  have  such  a  burden.  
They just preach. That’s all. But Paul had a burden to lead every single 
person to spiritual maturity. You cannot take the responsibility of being 
an  elder  in  a  church  lightly.  When  I  was  an  elder  in  our  church  at  
Bangalore for 25 years, I sought to know the spiritual condition of every 
single  adult  in  my  church,  so  that  I  could  correct  them,  rebuke  them,  
give them wisdom, speak encouraging words and strong words to them, 
so that I could present them perfect in Christ one day. I never wanted 
anything from them for myself. For their sake, for the sake of the Body of 
Christ, I had to go through a lot of crushing in my private life. God dealt 
with me in so many ways so that the aroma of Christ could come forth 
from me so that others would be blessed. This is true Christian ministry.
In 1:29,  Paul  goes  on  to  say,  “For  this  purpose  I  labour,  I  work  hard,  
striving.”  How  does  he  strive?  “With  the  mighty  power  of  the  Holy  Spirit  
– which first of all God works mightily inside of me.” God always has to 
work inside us by His Holy Spirit first and only then can He work through 
us  to  bless  others.  Those  of  you  who  serve  in  the  church,  make  these  
two verses your goal, to present every man perfect in Christ (1:28) and to 
have the fullness of the Holy Spirit by which you reach that goal (1:29).
Mysteries of Godliness
In 2:2, Paul says, “I pray that your heart will be knit together in love, attain-
ing to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, 
resulting  in  a  true  knowledge  of  God’s  mystery,  that  is,  Christ  Himself.” 
This word ‘mystery’ comes a few times in the New Testament and refers 
to a truth that can be known only if God reveals it to you through His 
Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 2:8–10 states, “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, 
nor entered the heart of man, all that God has prepared for those who love 
Him, but God has revealed them to us through His Holy Spirit.” There are 
only two mysteries that are called ‘great’ mysteries in the Bible. One is 
the mystery that God came in human flesh (1 Timothy 3:16): “Great is the 
mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh.” That is called the 
secret of godliness or the secret of how to live a godly life.

Jesus’ Triumph Over Satan                                                                                                                      797
Colossians
The second  mystery  is  about  the  church  as  the  Body  and  Bride  of  
Christ. Ephesians  5:32  says, “The two shall become one flesh. This is 
a  great  mystery,  but  I  am  speaking  about  Christ  and  the  church.”  The  
church being one flesh with Christ is the second great mystery.
We need revelation from God if we are to understand that Jesus came 
in the flesh, was tempted like us, and overcame all temptation, and how 
we now can follow in His footsteps, overcome sin and thus build the Body 
of Christ along with others who are walking the same way. Building the 
church as Christ’s Body is the greatest ministry anyone can ever do on 
the face of the earth. There is absolutely nothing greater than that.
Paul spent all his life labouring to build this church. The greatest serv-
ants  of  God  are  those  who  work  with  Christ  to  build  His  church.  It  is  
important  to  live  a  godly  life;  but  that  is  not  enough.  We  must  also  do  
what Paul did– build the church. Paul did not spend his life doing social 
work. Helping the poor in earthly matters is good, but that will not fulfil 
God’s eternal  purpose.  If  you  make  people’s  lives  more  comfortable  by  
giving them education and medical treatment alone, you would only have 
smoothened their pathway to hell! Initially, they were going to hell along 
a rough path, but you made that path a little smoother. Paul realised that 
the  most  important  of  all  ministries  was  to  lead  people  to  Christ,  lead  
them to a godly life and then build them together into a Body. That is the 
greatest ministry any of us can ever do. 
We respect all who do social work and help the poor in Christ’s Name. 
May God bless all who are called to do that. But Paul never got involved 
with that – even though there were so many social needs in the world in 
his time. Those who help the poor may get earthly honours like the Nobel 
peace prize. But Jesus and Paul would never have won the Nobel peace 
prize. Nobody gives Nobel prizes to those who build the church. 
In 2:11,  12,  Paul  says,  “In  Christ  you  were  also  circumcised  with  a  
circumcision made without hands in the removal of the body of the flesh.” 
Just like in circumcision there is a cutting off of some flesh, we must 
recognise that our flesh (self-will) was cut off on the cross. We must take 
that  position  by  faith.  In  water  baptism,  we  testify  that  we  have  been  
buried and raised with Christ (2:12). God commanded Abraham that all 
his  descendants  were  to  be  circumcised.  In  the  same  way  every  child  
of God needs to be spiritually circumcised – they must have no confi-
dence in their flesh (Philippians 3:3). Baptism is a symbol of that inward 
circumcision.
Jesus’ Triumph Over Satan
In 2:14,15, we read of the two things that Jesus did for us on the cross. 
First of all, He cancelled our debt to God. God’s Law had a list of command-
ments that we had to keep. But we broke them all. Every sin we commit 
is  a  debt  we  owe  to  God  our  Creator  –  and  we  have  all  accumulated  a  

798 Through the Bible: Christ in You – The Hope of Glory
Colossians
huge debt in our lives. Jesus paid our debt completely on the cross and 
tore up the certificate of debt. There is no debt against our names now.
The second thing Jesus did on the cross was to take away the armour 
of  all  the  demonic  principalities  and  powers.  When  Jesus  triumphed  
over them on the cross, He took away their weapons. We can picture it 
something like this: A whole lot of demons had machine guns pointed at 
helpless human beings like us – and we were scared of them. They were 
always  shooting  at  us,  and  we  always  had  to  run  for  cover.  But  Jesus  
took away all their machine guns and gave them all to us. Now they are 
on the run from us. We don’t have to be afraid of Satan or his demons 
any more. If we live with a clean conscience and dwell in humility, then in 
the name of Jesus we can live in victory over all of Satan’s forces all the 
time. The name of the Lord is a strong and mighty tower. The righteous 
can run into that Name and be safe (Proverbs 18:10).
Satan and all his demons were defeated on the cross, once and for all. 
If you ever meet a demon-possessed person, remember that the demon 
inside that person was defeated on the cross. His machine gun was taken 
away on the cross – and he doesn’t have any weapons. You can fire the 
name of Jesus at that demon now. It does not matter if you are weak. The 
weakest soldier with a machine gun can fire away at a stronger enemy 
who has no guns. That huge Goliath of a demon will fall before you. The 
Name of Jesus is the mightiest weapon of all.
Shadow and Reality
In 2:16–23, Paul speaks of various methods of “becoming holy” that people 
have thought up without any revelation from God. Some say, “Keep holy 
days, go on pilgrimages, keep the Sabbath”, etc. But the Holy Spirit says, 
“Don’t  let  anybody  judge  you  in  such  matters. The  Sabbath  was  only  a  
shadow. The reality is in Christ.” When you have the reality why do you 
need the shadow?
If  Paul  were  living  today,  he  would  have  said,  “All  those  ceremonial  
old-covenant  laws  and  festivals  were  only  like  a  photograph.  Now  you  
have the reality in Christ.” I look at my wife’s photograph only when I am 
travelling and away from her. But if she is right beside me, I would be crazy 
to be looking at her photograph. Even so, when Christ Himself is dwell-
ing in you, why do you need all those pictures? Christ, your Husband, 
is  with  you.  Why  do  you  need  His  photograph  then?  The  Sabbath  day  
and all those old-covenant festivals were only photographs and shadows. 
Now you have the reality – Christ.
Paul  then  goes  on  to  say,  “Don’t  let  anyone  cheat  you  of  your  prize.” 
There is a prize that God has reserved for you in heaven? Don’t let anyone 
cheat you of it by making you delight in self-abasement (a false humility). 
There is a lot of false humility among believers. False humility is actually 
spiritual  pride  wearing  the  garments  of  humility  and  pretending  to  be  
very humble. Get rid of it.

Shadow and Reality                                                                                                                                  799
Colossians
Paul speaks about worshipping “angels”. The word for “angel” can also 
be translated as “messenger”. There is a lot of worship of God’s messen-
gers in Christendom today. Many non-Christians worship their so called 
‘godmen.’  Many  Christians  have  godmen  too  –  Christian  leaders  whom  
they  admire  so  much  that  it  almost  amounts  to  worship!  To  respect  a  
godly man, to appreciate him and to listen carefully to his advice is all 
very  good.  But,  be  careful  that  he  does  not  take  the  place  of  Christ  in  
your  life.  Then  it  becomes  worship.  That  is  part  of  this  false  humility.  
You can’t become holy like that. Instead of holding on to that messenger, 
you must hold on to the Head (2:19). The best messenger is the one who 
helps you to get closer to Christ, the Head.
The other way of holiness that many people teach is through discip-
line: “Don’t handle this, don’t touch this, don’t taste this” (verses 20, 21) 
–  seeking  for  holiness  by  changing  one’s  diet.  Or  through  a  severe  
treatment of the body “Sleep on the floor and not on a bed. Fast for 40 
days.” (verse 23). I have seen people who fast for many days but who 
still  lose  their  temper  and  have  bitterness  in  their  hearts.  All  their  
fasting  has  not  made  them  holy.  They  still  gossip  and  speak  evil  of  
others. Severe treatment of the body doesn’t make anyone holy. It does 
have “an appearance of holiness”, but it does not deliver one from sin.
How  can  sin  be  dealt  with?  In  3:3,  Paul  says,  “You  have  died  with  
Christ.” That is the way. Take your position as dead with Christ. You have 
also been raised up in Christ (3:1). That is the way to genuine holiness. 
Not by keeping holy days, worshipping messengers, severe treatment of 
the body, or by discipline or fasting. None of these things will make you 
holy. Even if you practice these all your life, they won’t make you holy. 
The way to be holy is by dying with Jesus to this world and then living 
with  Jesus.  It  is  not  just  death.  If  you  only  think  of  death  to  Self,  you  
can  be  deceived  into  a  yoga  type  of  holiness,  with  self-denial,  etc.  But  
the  Holy  Spirit  wants  to  communicate  the  life  of  Christ  to  you  and  to  
manifest the life of Jesus in your body. He wants to enable you thus to 
live the way Jesus lived on earth in His body. One proof of that will be 
that your mind will be set on the things that are above (3:2). You won’t 
be occupied with the type of food you eat and other earthly disciplines. 
You will be occupied with the things that are above. That is where true 
holiness begins.
Notice  the  contrast  between  “your  mind”  in  3:2  and  “your  body”  in  
2:23.  It  is  not  by  suppressing  our  bodily  desires  and  passions  that  we  
become holy. It is when our mind is set on things above that our body will 
obey the Holy Spirit. “Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Let your 
mind  be  set  on  things  above.  Since  you  have  died  with  Christ,  consider  
the members of your body as dead” (3:1–3). This is the way of holiness 
that Paul explains in Romans as well: You are dead and risen with Christ. 

800 Through the Bible: Christ in You – The Hope of Glory
Colossians
Ask  God  to  give  you  an  understanding  of  this,  for  this  is  the  secret  of  
genuine holiness. When you see this truth, it can become as great a crisis 
experience in your life as your new birth.
Being Peaceful and Thankful
There are many prejudices we have that need to be crucified in this new 
life. There is no distinction between people of different races in the Body 
of Christ (3:11). We now look at all believers in the same way, whatever 
their race or culture may be. We bear with one another and forgive one 
another just as Jesus forgave us. The peace of Christ becomes the referee 
in our hearts, in our relationships with each other (3:15). Our conscience 
is  like  a  referee  that  tells  us  when  something  is  wrong.  In  a  football  
match, as soon as a player commits a foul, the referee blows his whistle. 
When the referee blows the whistle, the game stops. Nothing is counted 
until the foul is set right.
When  you  lose  peace  in  your  heart,  and  you  are  agitated  and  trou-
bled, that is your conscience blowing a whistle – indicating that you 
did  something  wrong.  Maybe  you  spoke  harshly  to  your  wife,  or  you  
did  something  unrighteous  with  money.  Once  that  whistle  is  blown,  
everything must stop. You have to set the foul right immediately. Never 
speak when you are agitated – at home or in a church meeting. You 
can bless people by keeping your mouth shut. Just confess your sin to 
God and to man; or give back what you took wrongly. Then the peace 
of Christ will be restored in your heart. If you listen to this referee you 
will never go astray. In some football matches, the players argue with 
the referee. But the referee’s word is final. Don’t argue with him, or he 
may send you off the field! Just set the matter right immediately. 
In 3:15, Paul says, “Be thankful for one another.” He has been speaking 
about the Body of Christ. We must learn to be thankful for one another 
in our local church.
Paul  then  speaks  about  home-life:  “Don’t  be  bitter  against  your  wife” 
(3:19).  What  a  word!  How  many  days  in  a  year  are  you  permitted  to  
be bitter against your wife? Not even once. When the Bible says, “Don’t 
murder,”  we  know  that  it  means  we  are  never  to  murder  anyone  even  
once. Even so, when the Bible says, “Don’t be bitter against your wife,” it 
means that we must not be bitter against our wives even once. The same 
God who says, “Don’t murder,” also says, “Don’t be bitter against your 
wife.” If you are a serious Christian, you will strive to achieve that goal at 
any cost. In 3:21, there is an exhortation for fathers: “Don’t exasperate 
your children.” Don’t keep on nagging them, or they will get discouraged. 
In 4:1 is a word for masters: “Treat your slaves fairly”. Be good to them. 

Being Peaceful and Thankful                                                                                                                  801
Colossians
Give them some money, even though they are your slaves and you are 
not obliged to pay them.
Then a couple of practical exhortations: Devote yourself to prayer (4:2). 
Always speak with grace, so that you reply wisely to everyone (4:6). You 
may speak like a lion in the pulpit, as the mouthpiece of God. But in 
your  private  conversation  with  people,  be  like  a  lamb.  Speak  always  
with grace, kindness and mercy.
In 4:12, we read of Brother Epaphras who was always praying for the 
Colossian Christians that they would become perfect. This was the burden 
of  the  apostles  –  that  every  brother  and  sister  must  become  perfect  in  
Christ.  They  were  not  happy  with  people  just  getting  converted.  They  
wanted them to become disciples. And then they wanted those disciples 
to become perfect. Those apostles were not so busy doing just evangelism 
that they had no time to lead people to perfection. This is how we must 
serve God today as well.
In 4:16, Paul refers to a letter he had written to the church in Laodicea. 
We read of the pathetic state of this church in Revelation 3:14–17. If they 
had taken heed to the warnings Paul had written to them, they would not 
have ended up in that state. Paul’s letter to the Laodiceans is not in the 
Bible. But I am sure it must have been full of prophetic exhortations that 
could have saved that church from calamity. At times, God may send a 
prophet to you with a word specifically meant for you. If you take heed to 
it, it can save you. If you reject it, you can be destroyed.
Paul mentions Demas who, at this time, was a coworker of his (4:14). 
But later, Demas got attracted by the things of this world and went astray 
(2 Timothy 4:10).
In 4:17,  we  read  a  wonderful  exhortation  that  Paul  gives  Archippus:  
“Take heed to the ministry which you received from the Lord, that you fulfil 
that.”  Don’t  bother  about  the  ministries  that  God  has  given  to  others.  
God has given you a particular ministry. Concentrate on that and fulfil it, 
at any cost. Put your name there in place of Archippus and take that as 
a word to your own heart. When I was a young man and I read this verse, 
I  put my name there in place of Archippus and I heard the Lord saying to 
me, “Take heed to the ministry that I have given you, and fulfil it. Don’t 
get sidetracked and do something else.” 
I want to say to all of you, “Don’t get sidetracked into social work, if 
God  has  called  you  to  build  a  church.  Don’t  sit  behind  a  desk  as  a  
Director  in  some  Christian  organisation,  if  God  has  called  you  to  a  
prophetic ministry. Take heed to the ministry God has given you and 
fulfil it.”



1 THESSALONIANS
A Church Ready for Christ’s Return
E
ven though Paul’s letters in the Bible begin with Romans and end 
with Titus, as far as we know, they were not written in that order. 
There are certain indications in some letters as to the time in which 
they were written. Paul was probably converted about 6 years after Jesus 
died  and  rose  again.  1  Thessalonians was probably Paul’s first letter – 
written 15 years after his conversion, and 5 years after he had started 
his first missionary journey (Acts 13). The order in which Paul wrote his 
letters  was  most  probably  1  and  2  Thessalonians,  Galatians,  1  and  2  
Corinthians, Romans, Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon, Philippians (these 
last four were written from prison), 1 Timothy, Titus, and 2 Timothy.
It is interesting to note that the very first letter that Paul wrote deals 
with  the  second  coming  of  Christ.  The  theme  of  the  letter  is  being  
ready for Christ’s return. The church in Thessalonica was a persecuted 
church; and Paul had been prepared to minister to the people there by 
being persecuted himself in Philippi before coming there. True servants 
of God are made mini-forerunners by God for other people. You cannot 
encourage a persecuted church if you have never been persecuted your-
self.  God  knew  that  the  church  in  Thessalonica  was  going  to  suffer  a  
lot of persecution. So before God sent Paul to Thessalonica, He allowed 
Paul to be beaten and imprisoned in Philippi (Acts 16:22–24). So Paul 
came  there  fresh  from  an  experience  of  persecution.  Later,  when  the  
Thessalonian Christians were persecuted, they realised that Paul, who 
gave them the gospel and established the church there was persecuted 
himself.  God  prepares  us  for  a  ministry  to  a  people  by  making  us  go  
through the same things that He knows those people are going to suffer. 
Only  such  a  preacher  can  minister  powerfully,  without  being  merely  
theoretical. So  what  God  takes  you  through  is  a  preparation  for  your  
future ministry.

804 Through the Bible: A Church Ready for Christ’s Return
1 Thessalonians
True Repentance and Faith
Paul speaks first about faith, love and hope “their work of faith, labour of 
love and steadfastness of hope,” (1:3) and in the closing verses of Chapter 
1  he  speaks  about  true  repentance.  Here  we  have  one  of  the  clearest  
definitions of true repentance in the New Testament: “turning to God from 
idols”  (1:9).  Repentance  is  turning  away  from  all  our  idols  and  facing  
God. When you live in sin, you face your idols and your back is toward 
God.  Your  idol  could  be  money,  your  job,  your  ambition,  some  sinful  
pleasure, your girl friend, or yourself. It could be visible idols too. There 
are many types of idols. Repentance is turning away from all those idols 
and turning 180 degrees around to God, so that your idols are now all 
behind your back. If you have not turned your back to such idols, you 
have not really repented.
Many Christians try to face God while still having idols in their lives. 
Their ambitions and interests are all in the world, but they also imagine 
that  they  are  born-again  Christians!  Such  “Christians”  are  the  most  
unhappy  people  in  the  world.  People  who  live  totally  for  their  idols  
of  pleasure  and  money  are  happier  than  such  “Christians”!  But  the  
people who live totally for God alone are supremely happy. The most 
miserable people in the world are those who try to live for God and the 
world. It’s like keeping your feet in two boats that are going in different 
directions.  You  fall  into  the  river  in  the  middle.  Many  problems  that  
“Christians” face are because they have not laid a proper foundation of 
repentance in their lives.
An idol is anything that takes the place of God in your life. It could even 
be a Christian leader whom you admire so much that he replaces God in 
your life; or it could be a particular Biblical doctrine that you love. 
Once we have turned to God, we are to spend the rest of our life serving 
the Living and True God, and waiting for His Son to return from heaven 
(1:9, 10). Here we have a perfect description of what true repentance and 
faith are. A Christian who has been converted like this alone has got a 
good  foundation.  He  has  put  money,  comfort,  food,  sleep,  the  opinion  
of people and everything else on earth in their proper place, and he has 
turned totally to God. His primary aim in life thereafter is to serve God. 
He may be in a secular job, but his primary aim is to serve God. He serves 
God expectantly waiting for the return of Christ from heaven. When Jesus 
returns, He will “deliver us from the wrath to come” (1:10). It is good for 
every Christian to check whether his experience corresponds to 1:9, 10.
Paul’s Example in Serving the Lord
In Chapter 2, Paul reminds them that just before he came to Thessalo-
nica,  he  had  suffered  persecution  and  been  mistreated  in  Philippi.  

Paul’s Example in Serving the Lord                                                                                                        805
1 Thessalonians
The  Thessalonians  remembered  how  Paul  had  preached  the  gospel  to  
them with great boldness in the face of much opposition. Thus, Paul was 
an example to the Thessalonian Christians, of one who was not afraid of 
persecution for the sake of the gospel.
Paul goes on to say something about his ministry that we should all 
give  heed  to:  “We  spoke  not  as  pleasing  men,  but  God  who  examines  
our  hearts”  (2:4).  That  should  be  the  testimony  of  all  who  preach  and  
teach that they never preach to please their hearers but only God. God 
constantly examines the hearts of all who preach to see whether they are 
seeking to please Him alone. 
Paul emphasised this when writing to the Galatian Christians too. Paul 
often emphasised the fact that he never sought to please men. Seeking the 
honour of men is a sin that is not recognised sufficiently in Christendom. 
Other sins are easily recognised, but not this one. Seeking man’s honour 
is  a  very  serious  sin.  Such  a  person  can  never  be  a  servant  of  Christ  
(Galatians 1:10).
Paul says in 2:5, that he never flattered anyone in his preaching. He 
never said anything just to please some rich people in the congregation 
– not even in private conversation. Many preachers flatter the rich and 
the influential to get some benefit from them. But a true servant of God 
will never flatter anyone. 
Paul goes on to say that he never preached in order to make money 
(2:5).  Many  preachers  know  what  to  say  that  will  make  people  give  
them  a  good  offering.  But  if  they  preach  the  truth  that  God  wants  
them to preach, they will be rejected by most churches. Most preach-
ers want to be invited back to large, rich churches and so they speak 
what pleases the people.
In Paul’s preaching he did not seek glory from people (2:6). Neither did 
he assert his authority over people, even though as an apostle he could 
have.  There  are  a  number  of  verses  here  that  teach  us  how  we  are  to  
serve the Lord. All who serve the Lord must meditate on this section of 
Scripture: There was no flattery, no desire for money, no seeking glory 
from people and no assertion of authority.
In addition to these negatives, Paul talks about some positive things 
as well, as to how he ministered and served among them. First of all, he 
served as a gentle nursing mother cares for her baby (2:7). Secondly he 
says, “We had a fond affection for you” (2:8). No man is fit to speak God’s 
word to people unless he has a great love for the people to whom he is 
speaking. If  you  don’t  have  a  real  love  in  your  heart  for  people,  forget  
about  preaching  to  them.  Go  and  do  something  else.  Thirdly,  he  says,  
“We  wanted  to  give  you  not  only  the  gospel  of  God,  but  we  wanted  to  
give you our lives” (2:8). What a challenging example for us! They didn’t 

806 Through the Bible: A Church Ready for Christ’s Return
1 Thessalonians
want  to  just  give  them  a  message;  they  wanted  to  pour  out  their  lives  
to serve them. Fourthly, he says how he worked hard night and day so 
that they wouldn’t become a financial burden on them (2:9). A servant of 
God must be a hard-working person. Many full-time Christian workers 
in our country don’t really do much hard work. They go in the evenings 
here and there for some meetings, but waste much of the rest of the day. 
They are not really full-time workers. They are only evening workers. The 
real full-time workers in India are those who do a secular job during the 
day,  throughout  the  week,  and  then  go  out  and  do  the  Lord’s  work  in  
the evenings and on Sundays. Paul made tents during the day and when 
he had some spare time, late into the night. Thus he earned his living 
and did not become a burden to anyone.
Paul goes on to say how devoutly, uprightly, blamelessly he behaved 
towards the believers in Thessalonica (2:10). Wherever Paul went, he 
could  say,  “It’s  not  just  my  message,  but  the  way  I  live  that  demon-
strates the gospel.” What a need there is for Christian workers in India 
who can say that!
In 2:11,  Paul  says  that  he  also  rebuked,  encouraged  and  implored  
those believers as a father. A true servant of God is both a mother and 
a father. As a mother, he deals gently with the believers, and as a father 
he gives them advice and disciplines them where necessary. Both these 
qualities must be found in every servant of God and in every elder of a 
church. I would encourage anyone who wants to serve the Lord to read 
and mediate much on 2:4–11, if he wants to be effective. 
In 2:18, Paul says, “I wanted to come to you but Satan hindered me.” 
It    is  true  that  Satan  was  defeated  on  the  cross,  his  armour  was  taken  
away from him, and he has no power over us. Jesus has given us author-
ity over all the power of the enemy (Luke 10:19). Paul was a wholehearted 
servant  of  God,  but  yet  he  says  that  Satan  hindered  him  at  a  certain  
point. He wanted to go to Thessalonica but Satan hindered him. 
We know from 2 Corinthians 12, that God allowed a messenger of Satan 
to harass Paul constantly. It was because Paul was such a wholehearted 
servant  of  God  that  Satan  was  harassing  him  constantly.  Satan  would  
have sent his junior (less powerful) demons after other Christians, but 
Satan  himself  went  after  Paul.  So  I  suppose  today,  Satan  will  go  after  
whoever  he  considers  to  be  the  most  wholehearted  servant  of  God  in  
the world.
Among the demons there are different levels of power. The Bible speaks 
about  evil  principalities  and  powers  (Ephesians  6:12).  The  stronger  
demons  go  after  the  more  wholehearted  Christian  workers,  and  the  
junior demons go after the half-hearted ones. Satan will totally ignore 
the proud and the money-loving Christian workers because he knows

1 Thessalonians
that they cannot harm his kingdom in any way! He knows that they 
will  destroy  themselves  and  destroy  others  along  with  them.  So  it  is  
actually  a  great  honour  if  Satan  considers  you  worthy  to  be  perse-
cuted, harassed and troubled. That means that he considers you to be 
a threat to his kingdom.
Satan  hindered  Paul  from  going  to  Thessalonica.  But  God  used  it  to  
fulfil His will – just like He used Paul’s thorn in the flesh also to keep 
Paul humble. When Paul could not go to Thessalonica, he sent Timothy 
there (3:2). That gave Timothy some needed experience in the ministry, 
and enabled him to grow to maturity. Sometimes when a senior worker 
cannot go somewhere, that can be a good thing, because a junior worker 
goes  instead  and  gets  experience.  So  God  turned  the  tables  on  Satan  
here,  just  like  He  always  does.  In  our  ministry,  if  we  live  in  the  will  of  
God, nothing that Satan can do can ever hinder God’s purpose for our 
ministry.
Paul had great joy in serving God. There are a number of expressions 
of joy in 2:19 to 3:9. He says, “My greatest joy is found in you Christians in 
Thessalonica” (3:9). Something is seriously wrong with a servant of God 
who does not find joy in those whom he serves.
Love in Human Relationships
In 3:12, 13, we read how we can have a heart of true holiness. Paul says 
there,  “May  the  Lord  cause  you  to  increase  and  abound  in  love  for  one  
another, because that is how He will establish your hearts unblameable 
in holiness.” So genuine holiness is increasing in love for one another. We 
can be established unblameable in holiness only if we love one another. 
That’s  a  very  important  corrective  for  those  who  imagine  that  holiness  
has  only  got  to  do  with  freedom  from  dirty  thoughts  and  modesty  in  
dressing. Many who have these good qualities are utterly selfish in their 
conduct.  They  are  concerned  about  their  own  inward  purity,  but  don’t  
have  much  of  a  concern  for  the  needs  and  problems  of  others.  They  
are  not  growing  in  love  for  others.  Such  people  are  not  holy;  they  are  
Pharisees.  The  way  God  establishes  us  unblameable  in  holiness  is  by  
filling our hearts with more and more love for others. Holiness without 
fervent love for others is a counterfeit holiness. True holiness is fervent 
love for God, fervent love for our fellow believers and fervent love for all 
men.  Those  who  pursue  this  path  will  be  established  unblameable  in  
holiness when Christ returns (3:13).
In 4:1–8, Paul speaks  about  purity  in  the  sexual  area.  4:4  could  be  
translated in two possible ways. The word “vessel” here (skeuos in Greek) 
could refer either to our body or to our wife. 
So it could mean: “Each of you must know how to possess his own body 
in sanctification and honour.” We must learn to keep our body holy and 

808 Through the Bible: A Church Ready for Christ’s Return
1 Thessalonians
pure, because the will of God is that we must be sanctified (4:3). There 
are many areas where we don’t know what God’s will is. But this is one 
area where we definitely know what it is. To be sanctified means to be 
separated from everything that is sinful, worldly and un-Christlike. We 
must learn how to keep our bodies free from all such evil.
4:4 could also mean: “Each of you must know how to acquire his own 
wife in sanctification and honour.” That means, the way you get your 
wife  must  be  in  a  holy  and  pure  way.  There  are  many  unholy  ways  
in which people try to get wives. Looking for a dowry is one of those 
unholy ways. Are you looking for a wife in a holy way, or do you look 
for worldly qualifications when looking for a wife? To look for a wife 
“in lustful passion”, is to look for a wife like the heathen do. But if you 
want to serve God, you must look for a wife who has the same godly 
desire that you have.
In 4:6, Paul goes on to say that “no one should ever cheat his brother in 
this matter.” That means, “Don’t get too friendly with someone else’s wife”, 
for “God is the avenger of those who do that.” We have to be very careful in 
our relationships with the opposite sex, because we live in a society today 
that  is  very  similar  to  the  one  that  the  Thessalonians  lived  in,  where  
sexual immorality is not considered sinful. There is, unfortunately, a lot 
of immorality among young people in churches and even among Christian 
workers in these days. It is important that, as Christians, we are different 
from the world, and that we have a clear testimony in this area. You must 
know how to preserve your body in purity in this area. Otherwise you will 
fail the Lord. Samson and David are tragic examples of people who knew 
God who failed. There are many like them in our day as well.
In 4:11, Paul urges the believers: “Make it your ambition to lead a quiet 
life,  to  mind  your  own  business  and  to  work  with  your  own  hands.”  In  
2 Corinthians 5:9, we saw that Paul says that his ambition was to please 
God. His statement mentioned here does not contradict that statement. 
Our  ambition  must  always  be  to  lead  a  peaceable  life,  not  quarrelling  
with anyone, minding our own business, not being busybodies in anyone 
else’s  affairs,  and  working  hard  to  support  ourselves  and  our  families.  
This is a great verse with some important exhortations that we would do 
well to take heed to.
Christ’s Return in the Clouds
In 4:13–18, Paul speaks about how it will be when Christ returns. “We 
don’t want you to be uninformed about those who have slept in the Lord.” 
That refers to those who have died in Christ. Jesus died and rose again; 
and  those  who  have  died  in  Christ  will  also  rise  again.  When  Jesus  
returns, we who are alive will not be taken up ahead of those who died 

Christ’s Return in the Clouds                                                                                                                  809
1 Thessalonians
in Christ before us. They will arise from the graves. That will be the first 
resurrection.  And  we  will  be  taken  up  together  with  them  to  meet  the  
Lord. Unbelievers will not rise for another one thousand years. They will 
rise in the second resurrection.
At  His  return,  our  Lord  will  descend  with  a  shout,  with  the  voice  of  
the archangel and with the trumpet of God. Then all the saints will be 
caught up to meet the Lord in the clouds. Jesus spoke about these very 
same matters, when He spoke to His disciples about His return. He said, 
“Don’t believe those who say, ‘He is here’ or ‘He is there’ or ‘He has come 
secretly’ ” (Matthew 24:26). What He was saying was that He would not 
come secretly, as many believe today. When He comes, it will be like the 
lightning that flashes from the east to the west. Every eye will be able to 
see Him.
When  will  Christ’s  coming  take  place?  Jesus  answered  that  too:  
“Immediately after the tribulation” (Matthew 24:29). Many believe that 
Christ will rapture His saints before the tribulation. But there is not a 
single verse anywhere in Scripture that teaches that: That is a doctrine 
of  men.  Jesus  Himself  clearly  stated  that  His  coming  would  be  after  
the tribulation. The events mentioned here in 4:16, 17 are exactly the 
same as mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24:30, 31: Jesus appearing in 
the clouds with the angels and a trumpet-sound, and the saints being 
taken up to meet Him.
In 5:2, we read, “The day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.” 
A  thief  does  not  announce  his  coming,  but  comes  unexpectedly.  Thus, 
every unbeliever will be surprised when the Lord returns. We, the sons 
of light, however, are expecting our Lord to come (5:4). We do not live in 
darkness.  So  we  should  not  be  asleep  spiritually,  but  alert  (5:6).  How  
can we know whether we are awake or asleep? When a man is asleep, 
the  things  that  are  real  around  him  in  the  room  are  invisible;  but  the  
things that are unreal (in his dreams) appear to be real. In the same way, 
a  believer  is  spiritually  asleep  when  the  real  things  of  eternity  appear  
unreal  to  him,  and  the  unreal  things  of  this  world  appear  real  to  him.  
This whole world is like an unreal dream when compared to heaven and 
eternity. The truly eternal things are the things of heaven. For believers 
who are asleep, the Lord will certainly come as a thief in the night. Paul 
says we look forward to that day and we eagerly await His coming. People 
around  us  will  be  imagining  that  everything  is  peaceful  and  safe  (5:3). 
But destruction will come upon them suddenly.
This  destruction,  it  says  here  will  come  suddenly  “like  birth  pangs  
upon a woman with child” (5:3). Jesus used the same expression when 
speaking of the last days (in Matthew 24:8). Every woman knows that 
before she gives birth to a child there is a painful time of labour which 

810 Through the Bible: A Church Ready for Christ’s Return
1 Thessalonians
can  last  for  many  hours.  (Some  mothers  say  that  it  was  so  painful  
that they felt like dying). It is only after that the child is born. This is a 
picture of the painful period of tribulation that will precede the coming 
of Christ. No child is born without those birth-pangs. And the coming 
of the Lord is not going to take place before this painful tribulation. We 
are not afraid of that period. It will be a great honour for us if the Lord 
allows us to be here as witnesses for Him and to lay down our lives for 
the sake of the gospel.
Final Exhortations
In 5:12, we  are  told  to  “appreciate  those  who  diligently  labour  among  
us, especially those who give us instruction.” Those who shepherd us as 
elders and who teach us God’s Word must be highly esteemed, and we 
must  express  our  appreciation  to  them.  This  debt  of  appreciation  that  
we  owe  them  is  just  as  important  to  be  paid  to  them  as  any  debt  of  
money.  There  are  two  extremes  I  have  found  among  Christians:  Some  
worship their leaders as gods, while others do not esteem their leaders or 
express their appreciation to them. If you disobey God’s command here, 
you alone will be the loser.
In 5:14–18, Paul gives nine brief and powerful exhortations: Admonish 
the unruly, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with 
all, never repay evil for evil, always seek good for others, rejoice always, 
pray  always  (that  means  have  a  spirit  of  prayer  all  the  time)  and  in  
everything give thanks – because all of these are God’s will for us.
Then  in  5:19–21,  Paul  gives  some  advice  about  the  gift  of  prophecy  
– first to those who prophesy and then to those who listen. If the Holy 
Spirit urges you at times to share a Word, stand up and speak up. Don’t 
quench  that  fire.  And  listeners  are  warned  first  of  all  not  to  despise 
“prophetic utterances” (the sharing of God’s Word in the meetings of the 
church)  and  secondly  not  to  accept  everything  they  hear  as  prophecy.  
This  second  warning  is  greatly  needed  in  our  day,  when  there  are  so  
many false “prophecies”. They must use their God-given discernment to 
decide what is from God and what is not. They must hold tightly to what 
edified them and throw away the rest. To use an illustration: Peel the skin 
off from the banana and eat the banana. The more spiritually mature the 
one who prophesies is, the thinner the skin of his banana will be!! 
In 5:22 and 23, we are urged to abstain from every form of evil. If we do 
this, we are assured that the God of peace will sanctify us and make us 
perfectly holy in spirit, soul and body and preserve us until the second 
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1 Thessalonians
In 5:23, we see more clearly than anywhere else in the whole Bible that 
man  is  spirit,  soul  and  body.  Man  is  the  tabernacle  of  God,  and  the  
Old Testament Tabernacle had three parts – the Most Holy Place, the 
Holy  Place  and  the  Outer  Court,  corresponding  to  man’s  spirit,  soul  
and body. God dwelt in the Most Holy Place then. That teaches us that 
God now dwells in our spirit – the most important part of our being. 
Our soul consists of our mind, emotions and will. God does not dwell 
in our mind or in our emotions. Our spirit consists of our conscience 
and the ability to receive the life of God.



2 THESSALONIANS
Dangers in the Last Days
T
he  second  letter  of  Paul  to  the  Thessalonians  also  deals  with  the  
subject of the second coming of Christ. This was probably written 
one year after the first letter. The first letter was written to comfort 
them  with  the  hope  of  the  return  of  the  Lord.  The  second  letter  was  
written to correct their wrong ideas about the second coming of Christ. In 
his first letter Paul told the Thessalonians to be ready for Christ’s return. 
Some of the Christians then said, “If the Lord is coming soon, why are 
we wasting our time working? Let us resign our jobs and spend our time 
telling people everywhere about the Lord’s return.” So they sat around 
lazily doing no work. So Paul had to correct their wrong ideas.
We  read  in  the  papers  every  now  and  then  of  some  crazy  cult  group  
that taught that the Lord would return on a certain date and who went to 
the top of some mountain to wait for Him. The leader of that cult usually 
made  a  lot  of  money  from  his  followers  by  making  them  sell  all  their  
pro perty and giving the money to him!! Those followers then wait for a 
few days and discover that they were deceived. 
Jesus said that no man knew the exact date or the hour of His return. 
He said that we could know when it was near, but not the exact date. Israel 
has re-occupied Jerusalem (Luke 21:24). So we know that the coming of 
the Lord is near. There is a lot of strife around Jerusalem (Luke 21:20). 
So we know that the coming of the Lord is near. But we don’t know the 
date  or  the  hour.  It’s  not  for  us  to  know  the  times  or  the  seasons  (Acts 
1:7). So no-one should resign his job and wait on some mountain for the 
Lord’s return. 2000 years have gone by since Jesus said He would return. 
If those Christians in Thessalonica had not been corrected by Paul, they 
would have been jobless and starving until their death. We must not be 
foolish like them.
In 1:4, Paul  is  joyful  that  those  Christians  were  faithful  in  their  
tribu lations.  Their  faithfulness  and  perseverance  in  the  midst  of  their  

814 Through the Bible: Dangers in the Last Days
2 Thessalonians
persecutions  were  a  clear  proof  that  they  were  worthy  of  the  kingdom  
of God (1:5). At the same time, that was a clear proof of God’s righteous 
judgement  on  the  unbelievers.  It  will  be  righteous  for  God  to  punish  
all those who afflicted His children, one day. Paul told them that when 
Christ returns, they would get relief from their tribulation. That teaches 
us that persecution will continue until the return of Christ (1:7).
When  Paul  wrote  that,  he  did  not  know  that  2000  years  of  church  
history would be filled with persecution of Christians everywhere. He was 
writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and he said relief would 
come  only  when  Christ  came  again.  Even  today,  Christians  are  being  
persecuted. I have read that more people have been killed for their faith 
in the Lord Jesus Christ in the last 100 years than in all the preceding 
1900 years. A lot of the persecution of Christians never gets publicised. 
But when Christ returns again, He will dole out judgement on “those who 
don’t know God and who don’t obey Christ” (1:8). And in that day, “Christ 
will be glorified in His saints” (1:10).
So  until  Christ  returns,  we  can  expect  to  be  persecuted,  if  we  are  
faithful.  We  will  be  persecuted  not  only  by  non-Christians,  but  by  our  
relatives  and  nominal  Christians  as  well.  That  is  our  appointed  lot  as  
believers, because we are here on earth like fish out of water. This world 
is not our home, and we are in constant conflict with this world system. 
We  are  strangers  and  foreigners  here  and  we  are  a  threat  to  Satan’s  
world system. That is why he hates us and persecutes us. If you become 
friendly  with  this  world,  then  it  will  stop  troubling  you.  But  then,  you  
won’t be a witness for Christ.
The Rise of the Antichrist
In Chapter 2, Paul continues to correct wrong notions about the Lord’s 
return. He tells them not to be disturbed or shaken by people who claim 
to  have  messages  and  visions  from  the  Lord  about  His  return.  Don’t  
believe them. This is a very relevant warning for our day when many are 
claiming just that. Don’t believe them. We have the Word of God as our 
guide, and that is enough for us. 
In  those  days,  people  were  writing  letters  to  Christians  and  signing  
them  “Paul”,  to  make  people  believe  that  those  were  letters  from  Paul.  
Those  days,  people  did  not  have  the  New  Testament  with  them  as  we  
have today.
Paul  told  those  Christians,  “Don’t  let  anyone  disturb  your  minds  by  
saying  that  the  day  of  the  Lord  has  come.”  Paul  was  saying,  “Don’t  let  
anyone tell you that Jesus came secretly and took away His saints.” Paul 
goes on to say that Christ’s coming won’t be like that, because the day 
of His return will not come until there is, first of all, a great falling away 
of Christians from the faith. That “falling away from the faith” is happen-
ing  in  our  day.  Secondly,  Paul  said  that  Christ  cannot  return  until  the  

The Rise of the Antichrist                                                                                                                        815
2 Thessalonians
Antichrist (the man of lawlessness) is revealed (2:3). The Antichrist has to 
come first and the period of tribulation has to be over. Everywhere in the 
New Testament we read this truth clearly that Jesus will return only after 
the great tribulation – and when he comes, everyone will see Him coming 
(See Matthew 24:27–31).
Chapter 2 is speaking about “the day of the Lord” – which is the day of 
Christ’s return. Some Christians separate the day of the Lord from the 
coming of the Lord. Clever people can twist Scripture to suit their own 
doctrines. We must not be deceived by them. We must not come to the 
Scriptures with any preconceived ideas and make the Scriptures fit what 
we believe. If we do that, God will allow us to be deceived (which is what 
it says in 2:10, 11). We must come to the Scriptures with no opinions of 
our own. We must allow our opinions to be moulded by the Scriptures. 
Only then will we will know the truth. 
Many Christians have opinions that they have inherited from the teach-
ers in their churches. Then they make every Scripture to fit this opinion. 
I was like that myself, in my early days as a believer, because I had not 
studied the Scriptures carefully. But when I studied God’s Word with an 
open mind, I found that I had to change many of my pre-conceived views, 
to make them fit with Scripture. One of the truths I then saw was that 
before Christ returned, the Antichrist would arise and Christians would 
go through the great tribulation.
That  does  not  mean  that  as  believers  we  await  the  great  tribulation.  
No. We await the return of our Lord. If you were to ask a pregnant wife, 
“Are you looking forward to your birth pains?”, she would say, “No, I am 
looking  forward  to  the  birth  of  my  baby!”  She  is  well  aware  that  the  
birth pains will come first; but she is not looking forward to those birth 
pains, but rather to the birth of her baby. In the same way, I am looking 
forward to the return of my Lord. But I know that there will be a time of 
tribulation that will precede the birth of Christ’s millennial reign.
During  the  tribulation,  the  Antichrist  will  “sit  in  the  temple  as  god” 
(2:4). He will get people to worship him. John says that that spirit of the 
Antichrist is already in the world. Some people are already sitting in the 
church  and  ruling  over  people  as  if  they  were  God.  This  characteristic  
of the Antichrist – acting like god in the church is called “the mystery of 
lawlessness” – and it is already at work (verse 7). When Christian leaders 
try to control your life, they are acting like God. That is the spirit of the 
antichrist and is unfortunately found in many Christian leaders today. 
There is a mystery of lawlessness, just as there is a mystery of godli-
ness. The mystery of godliness is that Christ was manifest in the flesh 
(1  Timothy  3:16). We  manifest  by  our  lives  that  it  is  possible  to  live  a  
godly life on earth – because Jesus lived like that on earth. The mystery 

816 Through the Bible: Dangers in the Last Days
2 Thessalonians
of lawlessness (sin) however is Satan is manifest in the flesh. Satan does 
not actually become flesh, but he influences the minds of Christians 
so that they believe that it is NOT possible to live a godly life in this 
flesh. So they take sin lightly, and proclaim by their lives that sin will 
forever  rule  over  them  (contradicting  Romans  6:14).  Thus  they  agree  
with Satan.
The Lord will slay the Antichrist with the breath of His mouth when 
He  comes  again  (2:8).  But  before  the  Antichrist  appears,  his  spirit  will  
move  around  the  world  preparing  the  way  for  him.  Just  like  John  the  
Baptist prepared the way for Christ’s coming, there will be a great move-
ment that prepares the way for the Antichrist. This spirit will manifest 
itself in all types of wickedness, Satanic power, soulish power and coun-
terfeit signs and wonders. There will be many counterfeit healings and 
miracles in the last days (2:9). We see that already in the multitudes of 
“healing campaigns” today, where men are exalted to the place of God, 
and cheat poor people of their money. All this is preparing the way for 
the Antichrist. Jesus does heal the sick and He does miracles even today. 
I  have experienced them myself. But there is a lot of counterfeit as well – 
and we need to discern between the two.
It  says  here  that  God  will  send  “a deluding influence”  (verse  11)  on  
many  people  because  they  “did  not  love  the  truth  so  as  to  be  saved” 
(verse 10). This is one of the scariest verses in the New Testament. If we 
are not willing to face up to the truth about ourselves when God shows 
us our selfishness or our pride or some other sin, and if we don’t long to 
be saved from those sins, then God Himself will allow us to be deceived. 
What a terrible tragedy that will be! Satan is already deceiving us, our 
hearts  are  deceptive  and  so  are  our  lusts.  On  top  of  these,  if  God  also  
allows us to be deceived, then we are doomed without hope. 
So we better make sure that God is on our side. If you want God to be 
on  your  side,  then  love  the  truth  about  yourself  when  God  shows  you  
your sin. When God shows you your covetousness, selfishness, love of 
money or pride, acknowledge it. Then say, “Lord, I want with all my heart 
to be saved from this.” If you justify yourself and cover up your sin, I can 
guarantee that God Himself will send a deluding influence on you so that 
you will believe what is false. You will believe the counterfeit miracles you 
see. Why is it that so many believers are deceived today by these counter-
feit miracles? Here is the answer: They don’t acknowledge the sin in their 
own life and they don’t long eagerly to be saved from it. 
“But  brethren,  we  give  thanks  for  you  because  you  were  chosen  that  
you  may  gain  the  glory  of  Jesus  Christ”  (2:14).  The  whole  purpose  of  
the  gospel  is  that  we  may  acquire  that  glory  of  the  Lord  Jesus  –  the  
fullness  of  grace  and  truth  in  Him  whereby  He  manifested  His  glory  
(John 1:14).

Final Exhortations
In 3:6–11, Paul warns the Christians there (and us) to “stay away from 
brothers  who  are  living  lazy  lives”.  He  reminds  them  how  he  had  lived  
among them. He had worked hard, never taking any money from them 
for his support. He even paid for his food. What a fantastic example Paul 
was as a servant of God. Very few full-time Christian workers ever think 
of paying for the food they are given. But Paul was different. It was not 
that he paid believers who invited him to their homes for a single meal. 
But since Paul stayed a long time there, some believers must have been 
supplying him with food on a regular basis – and he did not take advan-
tage of them. He was serving them as the Lord’s servant, and so he did 
have the right to receive food from them on a regular basis. But he did 
not use that right. He paid for the food. He worked night and day making 
tents and earned money and paid for the food. What an example for us to 
follow. A true servant of the Lord must be able to say to others, “Follow 
my example.”
Paul  pointed  out  his  example  to  them,  because  he  heard  that  some  
of them were leading undisciplined lives, and not working to earn their 
living. Perhaps  because  of  their  wrong  ideas  about  the  Lord’s  return,  
some of them thought, “If the Lord is coming soon, let us all quit our jobs 
and go around preaching the gospel.” And they ended up sitting around 
most  of  the  day  doing  nothing,  like  most  full-time  Christian  workers  
today!! And this led them to spend their time being busybodies in other 
people’s matters. 
So Paul laid down a rule for them, “If anyone is not willing to work, then 
he is not to eat, either. Such persons we command and exhort in the Lord 
Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread” (3:10, 12).
If you are serving the Lord full-time, you should be working harder than 
others who work in a secular job. You may not be able to earn your own 
living, as Paul did, making tents. Maybe you are financially supported by 
gifts from your church-members. If so, ask yourself this question: If my 
church-members have to work so hard, leaving home at 8 in the morning 
and returning at 7 pm in the evening, to earn their living, and they are the 
ones who support me, do I work as hard as they do? If you don’t work as 
hard as they do, then it’s not right to expect those people to support you. 
A  servant  of  the  Lord  must  be  a  hard  working  person  –  from  morning  
till night. The tragedy in Christendom is that most Christians in secular 
work are working much harder than full-time Christian workers! 
Finally, Paul says, “If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, 
take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that 
he will be put to shame. Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admon-
ish him as a brother” (3:14, 15). We must refuse to associate with lazy 
full-time  workers  who  were  never  called  by  God  but  who  have  gone  
into  Christian  work  merely  to  earn  their  living.  There  are  thousands  

818 Through the Bible: Dangers in the Last Days
2 Thessalonians
like that in India. We don’t treat them as enemies; but we are not to 
associate with them but admonish them.
May  the  Lord  help  us  consider  everything  written  in  this  letter  seri-
ously, because these are important truths that we must take heed to, if 
we are to be ready for the second coming of Christ.

1 TIMOTHY
The Church and Its Shepherds
T
he  letters  to  Timothy  and  Titus  are  the  closing  letters  that  Paul  
wrote towards the end of his life – 2 Timothy being the last. All three 
of them are related to the servant of the Lord serving in the church. 
The theme in 1 Timothy is the church and its shepherds – the attitude 
shepherds and leaders of the church should have, the way they should live 
and the way they should conduct church matters. It is interesting to note 
that these last three letters of Paul all have this same theme. Paul sensed 
that his time on earth was getting over and he was very concerned that 
the leaders of the church in the next generation should have the same 
principles and values that he himself had as a servant of the Lord. In his 
earlier letters he spoke more about the Christian life. But in these last 
three  letters  he  speaks  more  about  the  next-  generation  leaders  having  
the  same  values,  and  gave  them  prophetic  warnings  about  how  things  
would be in the last days, in order to prepare them for that time.
Paul unburdens his heart to Timothy here. And so we will see some of 
the most important things that a servant of the Lord must bear in mind. 
First of all, Paul says “Don’t allow people to preach strange doctrines in 
your church” (1:3). If you are a leader in your church you have a respon-
sibility to check the teaching that goes on in your church. You must be 
alert. In the early days of the church, believers had the freedom to stand 
up  and  share  what  was  on  their  hearts.  Some  of  them  may  have  had  
some strange ideas about the Christian life, because no-one had a Bible 
in those days. But today, even with Bibles in our hands, strange doctrines 
are being proclaimed in many churches. A leader must always be alert 
and never allow anyone to proclaim strange doctrines in his church.
Paul  also  told  Timothy  repeatedly  in  both  his  letters,  “Don’t  get  
involved in arguments and disputes about genealogies and speculations”. 
Speculations refer to matters not mentioned in Scripture, such as who 
Cain’s  wife  was.  You  don’t  need  to  know  the  answer  to  such  matters,  

820 Through the Bible: The Church and Its Shepherds
1 Timothy
because it won’t help you in any way. There are many similar questions 
that inquisitive minds can ask. Don’t get involved in such speculations.
Paul then reminds Timothy of the purpose of all his teaching: It is to 
get  people  to  love  from  a  pure  heart,  a  good  conscience  and  a  sincere  
faith (1:5). A pure heart is a heart that loves God totally – a heart that 
has no place for anybody or anything other than God. If the believers in 
your church are merely attending the church services but not growing in 
love for God and for one another, then your ministry is a failure, for such 
believers have failed to be what God wants them to be.
This love must also come from a good conscience and a sincere faith. 
Towards  the  end  of  his  life  Paul  stressed  the  importance  of  a  good  
conscience frequently. He mentioned his own “good conscience” when 
he  stood  for  trial  before  the  High  Priest  (Acts  23:1)  and  before  Felix  
(Acts  24:16).  And  now  he  tells  Timothy  of  its  importance.  Paul  had  
seen how Christian workers had made shipwreck of their lives by not 
keeping a good conscience (1:19). The sincere faith that Paul mentions 
here is a faith that can trust in the Lord in the daily trials of life, and 
not just a faith that trusts Him to forgive our sins and to take us to 
heaven.
This is a good verse (1:5) to keep in mind if you are called to build a 
local  church.  You  are  a  successful  elder  brother  if  you  have  led  your  
people to love God and others with a pure heart, a clear conscience and 
a sincere faith.
Paul warns Timothy in 1:6 that “some people have strayed away from 
these  fundamental  truths”  –  and  that  has  led  them  to  fruitless  discus-
sions and argument. “They want to be teachers of the law but they don’t 
understand what they are saying and the matters about which they make 
confident assertions.” I  have  heard  a  lot  of  preachers  in  Christendom  
and I have sensed that most of them do not speak from experience. They 
just preach what they have read in some book or studied in some Bible 
college or heard from someone else. They haven’t allowed God’s Word to 
become a part of their daily life. They haven’t come to a place where they 
love God with all their heart themselves. Then how can they lead others 
to such a life?
The word that you hear from a man of God is second hand. You must 
take  that  before  God  and  say,  “Lord, please convert this to first hand. 
Make  it  real  in  my  life.”  When  you  come  into  a  living  experience  with  
God of the truths you heard, then you can speak that as your message. 
It  is  no  longer  second-hand.  You  can  convert  every  message  that  you  
have heard from me in this way and make it first-hand from God. Many 
have  asked  me,  “Brother  Zac,  can  we  preach  your  messages?”  I  reply,  
“Certainly. But there is a condition. Live it first.” If you try to preach it

1 Timothy
without living it first, you will destroy yourself. You will be a teacher who 
does not understand what you are talking about.
Paul says about the law: “We know the law is good if you use it lawfully. 
But the law is not made for a righteous man” (1:8, 9). A righteous man 
does not need the law. Why will you need a law that says, “Don’t commit 
adultery,” when you are not even committing it in your thoughts? Why 
will you need a law that says, “Don’t commit murder,” when you are 
not  even  angry  with  people?  A  righteous  man  doesn’t  need  the  10  
commandments, because he is living in the Spirit at a far higher level. 
His standard is higher than the Law. “The law is made for those who 
are  lawless,  rebellious,  ungodly  sinners  and  a  lot  of  things  like  that,  
and anything else is contrary to the glorious gospel of the blessed God” 
(1:9–11). We saw in Galatians how we are free from the law when we 
walk in the Spirit.
How God Prepares a Man for the Ministry
There is something else that Paul emphasised much towards the end of 
his life: “Look at my example”, he says, “see how I lived” This is what he 
tells Timothy repeatedly.
“I  thank  Christ  Jesus  our  Lord  who  has  strengthened  me  because  He  
considered me faithful, putting me into the ministry” (1:12). Even though 
God sovereignly calls people to His ministry, He tests a man before He 
puts him into the ministry. Paul was tested for a period of 10 years (from 
Acts 9 where he was converted to Acts 13 where he was sent out into the 
ministry). What was happening to Paul those 10 years? God was watch-
ing Paul to see whether he was faithful in his daily life as a Christian. 
After God tested him for 10 years and saw his faithfulness, then He said, 
“Now I will send you out to serve Me.”
If God calls you He will first test you. I know that God tested me for 
16  years  (9  of  them  in  full-time  Christian  work),  before  He  opened  up  
the  ministry  He  had  for  me  –  to  build  new-covenant  churches.  Don’t 
imagine that as soon as you step out into Christian work, you will have 
an anointed ministry. God will test you to see whether you are faithful 
in the little things. If you are faithful in little things, faithful to study His 
word, faithful with money, faithful with time, faithful in purity, upright, 
honest, and humbling yourself under the authorities God places over you, 
then, after 10 years perhaps, He will put you into an effective ministry.
When God Himself puts you into a ministry, you will do more in one 
year than when doing ministry according to your own ideas in 30 years. 
Paul says, “He (Christ) put me into the ministry” (1:12). It wasn’t any man 
who  ordained  Paul.  “Even  though  I  was  a  blasphemer,  a  persecutor” 
(1:13). God puts converted sinners who were once wicked into the minis-
try. That is an encouragement to all who have lived a very wicked life in 

822 Through the Bible: The Church and Its Shepherds
1 Timothy
the past. In one of the writings that have come down from the 2
nd
 century, 
the author says, that Jesus Christ, in order to show that He came not 
to  call  the  righteous  but  sinners  to  repentance,  picked  up  some  of  the  
worst sinners of His time to become His apostles. Paul was one of them. 
“Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners among whom I am the 
greatest” (1:15). So God doesn’t necessarily pick up those who have been 
brought up in God-fearing homes and who have lived clean lives always. 
He does use many like that. But He also picks up those who have lived in 
the depths of sin. He picks up adulterers, thieves, drunkards and drug 
addicts, and makes them apostles, to prove that sin in one’s unconverted 
life doesn’t disqualify anyone from even becoming an apostle. Paul, the 
greatest  sinner  became  the  greatest  apostle.  God  can  do  a  lot  through  
any of you, if you will repent of your sins and trust Him.
I want you to notice a progression in the apostle Paul’s understanding 
of his own sinfulness. Many think that the closer they get to God they 
will be less and less aware of sin in their lives. But that is not true. Every 
godly  person  will  acknowledge  that  the  closer  he  gets  to  God  the  more  
he is aware of sin in his own life, because God is so holy. Isaiah saw the 
holiness of God and said, “Lord, I am a sinful man.” Job said that. Peter 
said  that.  John  said  that.  And  Paul  said  that.  In  1  Corinthians  15:9, 
about 10 years before he wrote 1 Timothy, Paul said, “I am the least of the 
apostles.” Five years later in Ephesians 3:8, he says, “I am the least of all 
the believers.” Still five years later when he wrote 1 Timothy he says, “I am 
the worst of all the sinners in the world.”
So how shall we assess our spiritual growth? By being more and more 
aware of our littleness, our nothingness and our sinfulness. If that is 
the way you are growing, then you are growing in the right direction – 
you are coming closer and closer to God.
In 1:18, 19, Paul urges Timothy, “Fight a good fight, keeping faith and a 
good conscience which some have rejected and have suffered shipwreck.” 
There  are  people  who  did  not  keep  a  good  conscience,  and  who  made  
shipwreck  of  their  lives.  They  lost  their  faith.  Sometimes  you  read  of  
believers losing their faith. I heard of a born-again Christian who went to 
a liberal Bible seminary and lost his faith altogether after he heard what 
was taught there. How did he lose his faith? In the first place he shouldn’t 
have  gone  there  at  all.  Secondly,  if  he  had  kept  a  good  conscience,  he  
would not have lost his faith. Many lose their faith when they don’t stand 
up for their convictions. Such people deserve to lose their faith and to go 
to hell, because hell is made for cowardly people who won’t stand up for 
what they know to be right (Revelation 21:8). 
Among  the  ones  Paul  named  as  examples  were  Hymenaeus  and  
Alexander.  Some  people  say  we  must  never  mention  names.  But  Paul  
was not afraid of naming people who were leading others astray. He had 

What to Pray for                                                                                                                                        823
1 Timothy
to warn others about them. So Paul delivered Hymenaeus and Alexander 
over to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.
What to Pray for
In 2:1,  Paul  says,  “I  want  you  to  pray  and  give  thanks  for  all  men.”  We  
have already considered exhortations to give thanks at all times and for 
everything.  But  here  it  goes  even  further  and  says  that  we  must  give  
thanks  for  all  men.  That  means  that  we  say,  “Lord,  I  am  thankful  for  
everybody,  those  who  harm  me  and  those  who  do  me  good,  because  
You make everybody to work for my good.” You can’t do that unless you 
believe in Romans 8:28. Paul says here that we must especially pray for 
those in authority in the government. The ruler of Rome when Paul wrote 
this letter, was Nero, one of the worst of all Roman emperors, one who 
persecuted Christians and who later on chopped off Paul’s head. Yet the 
Holy Spirit says that we must pray for such leaders. So we are to pray 
not  only  for  those  in  authority  who  are  upright,  but  even  for  the  most  
ungodly among them.
What  are  we  to  pray  for?  We  are  to  pray  that  God  will  restrain  the  
forces  of  darkness  and  prevent  them  from  hindering  His  purposes  on  
earth. What should we pray for in India? We do not expect that our rulers 
will  be  believers.  Let  them  be  unbelievers.  There  were  no  believers  in  
authority in Paul’s time in any country. We pray and ask Almighty God 
our All-powerful Father to control the government in our country. In our 
church we have always prayed at election time that God would bring a 
good government to power. We have also prayed that God would control 
the  decisions  taken  by  the  government.  And  we  have  seen  amazing  
answers  to  our  prayers.  If  you  don’t  have  the  faith  that  Almighty  God  
in heaven can control the government of a country, then of course you 
should  not  pray.  It’s  no  use  praying  if  you  don’t  have  faith.  I  believe  
however that even a few people who are living godly lives and with a good 
conscience can pray and influence a country’s government in a way that 
fulfils God’s purposes in that country.
At times, God’s will may be that His church should go through perse-
cution – to purify its members. Then we must accept that. The early 
Christians  were  persecuted  for  nearly  200  years.  Jesus  warned  His  
disciples that in the last days, “all men will hate you.” Then how can we 
pray, “Lord, don’t let people hate me”? How can we pray against what 
our Lord Himself said would happen? Jesus also said that in the last 
days there would be famines, earthquakes and wars. How then can we 
pray that there should be no famines or earthquakes or wars? But we 
can pray that the forces of evil will be restrained.
In 2  Thessalonians  2:6,  7, we read of a restraining influence in the 
world. That is the Holy Spirit operating through the church. One day the 

824 Through the Bible: The Church and Its Shepherds
1 Timothy
Holy Spirit will stop all His restraining and then the Antichrist will arise 
in power. But until that day comes, we must pray for those in authority 
in our country, and influence them by our prayers. We can influence the 
government far more by prayer than by getting involved in politics. We do 
not pray that we will not be persecuted, but rather that we may be able 
“to live a quiet life, in all godliness and dignity” (2:2). If however God sees 
that  we  Christians  need  a  season  of  persecution  in  India,  then  we  will  
accept that as well.
In 2:4, Paul says that “God wants all men to be saved and to come to 
the knowledge of the truth.” That teaches us that God wants every single 
human being in the world to be saved. God has not predestined anyone 
to go to hell. This verse teaches us that God not only wants everyone to 
be saved, but also to come to the full knowledge of the truth about Him. 
Once a person is saved, the next part of God’s will is that he should come 
to the full knowledge of the truth about God.
In 2:5,  we  are  told  that  “there  is  one  God  and  one  Mediator  between  
God and men, the Man Christ Jesus”. 35 years after Jesus ascended into 
heaven the Holy Spirit still refers to Him as ‘the Man Christ Jesus?’ He is 
not called the God-man, as some mistakenly call Him. He is 100% God 
and He always was. But once He took human form, He is forever 100% 
Man as well. He has taken our manhood to heaven to represent us there. 
And  He  has  given  us  His  Divine  nature  to  represent  Him  here  on  this  
earth. Jesus is doing His part faithfully in heaven, representing us before 
the  Father.  We  must  do  our  part  faithfully  representing  Him  faithfully  
here on earth.
Women’s Ministry in the Church
From 2:9 onwards, the Holy Spirit speaks about the way women should 
dress and conduct themselves in the church. Women must wear cloth-
ing that is discreet and modest. That means that her dress-style should 
not be one that provokes men to lust after her. The dress-fashions of the 
world are designed to provoke men to lust. Sisters, be careful when you 
buy your clothes to ensure they are modest. If a tailor is stitching your 
clothes,  tell  him  exactly  how  you  want  your  body  to  be  covered.  To  be  
modestly dressed doesn’t mean to be shabbily dressed. It is a good testi-
mony for all brothers and sisters to be dressed neatly and decently – and 
even smartly. There is nothing wrong in a woman looking as attractive as 
possible, but not in a way that provokes men to lust.
The Holy Spirit goes on to say that women should not to adorn them-
selves  with  fancy  hairstyles,  or  gold,  or  pearls,  or  expensive  clothes.  
Preachers  in  some  churches  emphasise  the  ‘not  with  gold’  part  but  do  
not emphasise the ‘not with expensive clothes’ part. They will tell a sister 
to remove her 800-rupee earrings, but will say nothing about her 10,000-
rupee  saree!  Thus  they  encourage  her  to  be  a  hypocrite.  The  main

1 Timothy
emphasis  in  this  passage  is  to  avoid  all  display  of  wealth  with  grand  
clothes and jewellery. Instead Christian women should adorn themselves 
with good works – as is fitting for godly women.
The  Holy  Spirit  then  goes  on  to  speak  about  the  ministry  of  women  
in the church. The subject of 1 Timothy is the church and its shepherd. 
Paul  tells  Timothy  in  3:15,  “I  am  writing  these  things  so  that  you  will  
know  how  to  conduct  yourself  in  the  church.”  In  the  church  meetings,  
“a woman must quietly receive instruction.” (2:11). She should not try to 
teach and she should not have any position of authority over men – as a 
pastor or an elder. She can teach little children at home and in a Sunday 
School class. She can even be an evangelist or a missionary and preach 
the gospel to unconverted men and women. She can pray and sing and 
even prophesy briefly in the church meetings (as we read in 1 Corinthians 
11:5). But  she  is  commanded  “to  be  quiet”  as  far  as  teaching  men  is  
concerned. She can give her testimony in the church and share a word 
that has been a blessing to her, but she must not teach. She must not 
exercise authority over men.
In Romans 16, we read of 5 women who were co-workers of the apostle 
Paul. They were not just cooking the food. They were actually serving the 
Lord – in evangelism and with the women and children in the churches. 
So  women  had  a  great  ministry  in  the  early  church.  In  a  country  like  
India, it is very difficult for a man to speak to women. Who then will 
reach 50% of India’s population (women) with the gospel? The sisters in 
the church. Women in the church can have a great ministry in counsel-
ling other sisters and in evangelism to reach out to India’s women. We 
should not hinder women from having that ministry. But when it comes 
to authority in the church, it was Adam who was created first and then 
Eve (2:13). And secondly, it was Eve who was deceived, not Adam (2:14). 
Women also have a great ministry through bearing children. Timothy 
who got this letter, became a man of God through the godly upbringing 
of  his  mother.  If  it  had  not  been  for  his  mother,  he  would  never  have  
become  an  apostle.  Mothers  are  the  ones  who  are  more  at  home  with  
their children than fathers. SO they can have a great influence on their 
children and train them to be disciples of Jesus. Here, it goes on to say, 
“Women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue 
in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint” (2:15). The Lord told Eve 
in Genesis 3 that she would bear children through much pain. So when 
Paul speaks of Adam and Eve here, he remembers that and tells women 
that they don’t have to fear childbirth. God will take care of them when 
they are delivering children. Let them only continue in faith and love and 
purity.
Qualifications for Elders
In Chapter 3, the Holy Spirit speaks about the qualifications for elders 
and other servants in the church In 3:1–7, the qualifications for elders 

826 Through the Bible: The Church and Its Shepherds
1 Timothy
are mentioned. They must have a good testimony in the world and they 
must not have more than one wife. In those days there were people who 
were married to two or three wives. If the man and all his three wives got 
converted, what was he to do? The man must live only with his first wife 
and support the others financially in another house. They can all be a 
part of the church. But such a man cannot be an elder in the church, 
even if he is a good brother. In the same way, a divorced-and-remarried 
man cannot be an elder of a church (because he has two wives). It’s good 
for elders of churches to be married men, because they have to counsel 
married people. An elder must be temperate, wise, respectable, hospita-
ble, able to teach, not a lover of wine. He must not be one who wants to 
live a selfish, comfortable life. He must not be an argumentative man, but 
gentle. And above all, he must be free from the love of money.
Notice how much emphasis there is in the New Testament on freedom 
from the love of money - which is never spoken of in the Old Testament. 
In  the  Old  Testament  the  Israelites  were  merely  warned  about  the  
dangers of wealth. But Jesus and the apostles preached on the neces-
sity of being free from the love of money.
An elder must be one who can control his own children well. If a man 
cannot keep his children at home under control how can he take care of 
the house of God? If he cannot take care of 3 or 4 children at home, how 
can he take care of 300 children in the church? Impossible. So the way 
a man brings up his children and controls and keeps his house in order 
is one of the qualifications to be given responsibility in the church. This 
teaches us that our home life is very important, if we are to be servants 
of the Lord. Children of some pastors are the worst behaved children in 
his church. That is a very bad testimony. Such a man should resign from 
his position of leadership in the church. New converts must not be made 
elders because they can fall into pride (3:6).
The  word  “deacon”  (3:8)  is  actually  a  Greek  word  “diakonos”  that  
has  unfortunately  been  imported  into  the  English  Bible.  It  just  means  
“a  servant”  and  should  have  been  translated  as  such.  Elders  are  the  
ones  who  are  the  spiritual  leaders  of  the  church.  But  there  are  many  
non-spiritual responsibilities like handling finances and other practical 
matters  such  as  looking  after  the  distribution  of  food  to  the  poor,  etc.,  
in every church, which have to be taken care of. For this, we need “serv-
ants”. This word “servant” is much to be preferred to the dignified word 
“deacon”, which can give some servants a false sense of importance! Such 
servants also must not be double tongued (3:8–10). That just means that 
they should not say one thing to one person and another thing to another 
person. They must also be sincere and upright. They must be people who 
hold the mystery of the faith, and people who live with a good conscience. 
Such servants also must be (like elders), husbands of just one wife, who

manage their own children well (3:12). Even those who are responsible 
for the practical aspects of a church’s ministry must have a good testi-
mony in their family-life.
In 3:11,  Paul  speaks  about  women-servants  in  the  church  (“deacon-
esses”). Women also can be given many ministries of service in the church, 
other than spiritual leadership and teaching men. They can teach women 
and  children  and  help  in  many  practical  ways.  But  they  must  not  be  
malicious gossips. The Greek word translated as “malicious gossips” here 
is “diabolos”, which is translated as “devil” in 34 other places in the New 
Testament.  So  what  Paul  is  saying  is  that  women  should  not  be  little  
devils, slandering others! Of course, men also should not be little devils 
– but Paul perhaps knew that women have a greater tendency and oppor-
tunity to gossip than men. Men are usually out at work the whole day 
whereas women are at home and when they are older, they don’t have 
much to do at home. So they can visit other women and sit with them 
and slander others. Women-servants must be self-controlled and faith-
ful. Only such women must be given a ministry in the church.
The Great Mystery of Godliness
In 3:15, 16, Paul moves on to a very important topic. This is the great 
mystery  of  godliness.  There  are  two  great  mysteries  mentioned  in  the  
New Testament. One is mentioned here: Christ coming in our flesh. The 
other is mentioned in Ephesians 5:32 – the church being one flesh with 
Christ. A mystery in the New Testament refers to a truth that you cannot 
understand  without  divine  revelation.  How  can  the  uncreated  eternal  
God become a man? Quite frankly, I can’t explain it. How can such a Man 
be tempted in all points as we human beings are – which is implied in 
His coming in the flesh (Hebrews 4:15)? Quite frankly, I don’t know. But 
I believe it – and it has become for me, the secret that led me to a godly 
life. The Living Bible paraphrase of this verse reads thus: “It is quite true 
that the way to live a godly life is not an easy matter. But the answer lies 
in Christ, who came to earth as a man and was proved spotless and pure 
in his spirit”.
There was one Man who came in the flesh and walked on this earth 
and was tempted exactly like us and yet lived a godly life. That is why 
we can also live a godly life. Christ in the flesh is the living proof that a 
man can live as God wants man to live on earth – loving God wholeheart-
edly  and  loving  other  men  as  oneself,  overcoming  the  lust  of  the  eyes,  
controlling one’s temper, never jealous, never bitter, etc.
Jesus came in the flesh and He was vindicated by the Spirit (3:16). 
That means the Holy Spirit examined every area of His life and said it was 
100% pure. He was beheld by angels. Angels watched this great mystery 
of God becoming flesh and walking on this earth as a Man, being tempted 
and overcoming in all areas. This is what we proclaim in all the nations 

828 Through the Bible: The Church and Its Shepherds
1 Timothy
of the world. People believed on Him in the world when He was here also. 
And He was taken up to glory. This is the secret of godliness, and this 
is the way we have to go too. Today we are in the flesh. The Holy Spirit 
examines our lives to see whether we are pure. Angels are watching us 
(Ephesians  3:10).  Our  life  is  a  proclamation  to  the  nations  about  what  
the gospel is. People believe, and one day we will be taken up to glory as 
well, if we are faithful.
But in contrast to God’s method of holiness, the Holy Spirit says that 
in the last days many Christians will fall away from their faith being 
deceived  by  deceitful  spirits  (operating  through  preachers)  who  will  
preach some other method of holiness (4:1). These new doctrines will 
be called “doctrine of demons”. When we read of doctrines of demons, 
we may imagine some horrible teachings. But they are not. They are 
just deceptive, like forbidding marriage, for example. In the last days, 
some will teach that celibacy is the way to godliness. That is a doctrine 
of a demon. And some will teach that the way to a godly life is through 
avoiding  certain  types  of  food  –  avoiding  meat  or  by  fasting  and  by  
disciplining  oneself!!  These  are  all  doctrines  of  demons.  They  appear  
good. But it is all a deception!
The way to a godly life is through allowing the life of Christ to be mani-
fest in our flesh, by partaking of His nature and following His example 
in the power of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will show you the life of 
Jesus and transform you into that likeness. This is the truth that every 
church  must  be  a  pillar  and  support  of.  Otherwise,  we  will  produce  a  
church  with  a  lot  of  rules  and  regulations  such  as,  “We  must  fast,  we  
must pray, we must read the Bible, etc.” All these things are very good, 
but they will only produce legalistic Pharisees, if we don’t emphasise the 
life of Christ being manifest in us, through the Spirit’s power. If some-
body wants to remain celibate, or to fast, that is fine. But that is not the 
secret of godliness.
Paul  goes  on  to  say  that  the  reason  why  many  are  deceived  in  this  
matter, is because they have hypocrisy in their lives (4:2). They have the 
spirit of lying in them and their conscience is bad. If there is hypocrisy 
in your life, or lying, or if you have a bad conscience, you are a perfect 
candidate for deception by the doctrines of demons.
Then he tells Timothy, “If you point out to the believers that the secret 
of godliness is not in all such self-discipline but in the life of Christ being 
manifest in their flesh, then you will be an excellent servant of Christ 
Jesus” (4:6). Do you want to be a good servant of Jesus? Point out these 
things  to  others  and  you  will  be  an  excellent  servant  of  Christ  Jesus,  
constantly nourished on the words of faith. He says, “Don’t waste your 
time with all these worldly stories which are only fit for old women.” Old 
women  have  nothing  else  to  do,  and  so  they  sit  around  telling  worldly  

Be an Example by Your Life                                                                                                                     829
1 Timothy
stories. Paul says, “Don’t waste your time listening to such fancy tales. 
But rather discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.” (4:7).
So Paul is not against discipline. There is a great need for discipline in 
the life of every Christian. There is a great need for fasting and prayer. 
But by itself, bodily discipline and physical exercise cannot make anyone 
godly. Godliness on the other hand is profitable in this life and in the 
next. In other words, if you live a godly life it will even improve your phy si-
cal  health.  We  can  be  physically  healthier,  if  we  are  free  from  jealousy,  
bitterness and anger. We will be saved from acidity-problems and asthma 
and arthritis and migraine headaches, if we live lives free from bitterness 
and anxiety. I am not saying that these sicknesses are always caused by 
spiritual causes. No. Most often they are caused by natural causes. But 
at times, these sicknesses could come because of sin in a person’s life.
Be an Example by Your Life
Timothy  was  a  young  man  in  the  church  in  Ephesus,  and  there  were  
many  older  people  in  that  church.  So  Paul  tells  him  not  to  let  anyone  
look down on him because of his youth (4:12). A young preacher can feel 
intimidated by older people in his church, particularly if some of them 
are rich and influential people. Paul urges Timothy not to allow them 
to intimidate him, but to be an example by his life, in the godly way he 
speaks, in the way he conducts himself, in his love for them, by his faith 
in the midst of all his trials, in the purity he has in his life and in every 
area. This is in direct contrast to what Paul said in 4:1–4. False teachers 
merely  teach,  whereas  true  teachers  teach  by  example.  False  teach-
ers teach theories. True teachers teach by their lives. 4:13 emphasises 
public reading of the Scriptures, because in those days, believers did not 
have Bibles. So the one who had a Bible had to read out large sections of 
it for the people to hear. Today, believers can read large sections of the 
Scripture at home.
Then Paul reminds Timothy that he needs something more than a good 
life  and  Scripture-knowledge.  “Be  a  good  example  and  give  attention  to  
Scripture” (4:12, 13). That is good. But “don’t neglect the gifts of the Holy 
Spirit” (4:14). Paul reminds Timothy that he had laid hands on him along 
with  other  elders  to  impart  a  spiritual  gift  to  him.  We  need  the  gifts  of  
the Spirit also to serve the Lord. We must “earnestly desire to prophesy” 
(1 Corinthians 14:1) – that is, to speak in such a way that our words go 
home to people’s hearts like an arrow, like the words of the prophets in 
the Old Testament, like the words that go out of God’s mouth that never 
return empty (Isaiah 55:11). To minister like that, we need the anointing 
of the Holy Spirit. Jesus needed it and we all need it too – all the time. 
This  is  not  something  we  can  get  once  for  all.  No.  We  must  seek  to  be  
anointed at all times.
Young people: Don’t feel that you have to wait until you are 40 years 
old to serve the Lord. I was born again when I was 19 and baptised when 

830 Through the Bible: The Church and Its Shepherds
1 Timothy
I was 21. And I started preaching immediately. I didn’t know much then. 
But with the little I knew, I could teach the “A, B, C...” of the Christian life 
to those who knew less than me. As I grew up I could teach people more. 
A first-standard student can teach a kindergarten-student. Why do you 
have to wait until you are old before you start to preach God’s Word? The 
moment you are converted, start sharing with those who know less than 
you – especially with those who are not yet converted. Always be ready 
to share God’s Word and to seek God for the power of His Spirit to share 
it effectively.
In 4:15, Paul urges Timothy to “take pains with these things.” A busi-
nessman takes a lot of pains to earn money and to establish his business 
firmly. If you are serious about the Christian life, you will take a lot of 
pains to study the Scriptures, seek for the gifts of the Spirit and cleanse 
your  life  from  everything  impure.  One  translation  of  this  verse  reads,  
“Be  absorbed  in  them.”  When  you  are  absorbed  with  these  things  your  
progress will become evident to everybody.
Let me give you a negative example of what “being absorbed” with some-
thing can mean. A family was watching a popular television programme 
in their home and totally absorbed with it. Some thieves who knew that 
the family was thus occupied, quietly got into their house and stole what-
ever they could! And the family never knew about the theft until the TV 
programme was over.
In the same way, but in a positive sense, we can be so absorbed with 
Jesus Christ and His Word that the temptations of this world don’t attract 
us so much. And we won’t be chasing after the many things that worldly 
people chase after. If you live an “absorbed” life like that, you will make 
progress constantly. Every year you will be a better Christian and a more 
effective servant of the Lord.
In 4:16, Paul urges Timothy to pay close attention to two areas: his life 
and his teaching. These are the two areas that we must watch constantly. 
Our life and our teaching must both be pure. Paul says that if we perse-
vere  in  these  two  areas,  we  will  save  ourselves  and  others  as  well.  We  
first need to save ourselves. Only then can we save others. What that 
means  is:  If  you  yourself  have  not  been  saved  from  some  sinful  habit,  
how will you be able to save others from it? If you preach above the level 
of your life, you will be a hypocrite and God will not bear witness to your 
words. We must be serious about our Christian life, just as businessmen 
are  serious  about  the  way  they  run  their  businesses.  They  are  whole-
hearted about making profits. In the same way, we must persevere and 
give ourselves wholly to living for God and serving Him.
Some Practical Instructions
In 5:1, Paul exhorts Timothy that since he was a young man, he should 
ensure  that  he  always  spoke  respectfully  to  older  people  and  that  he  

Some Practical Instructions                                                                                                                     831
1 Timothy
treated older women like mothers and younger women as his own sisters, 
in  all  purity.  Many  young  brothers  today  are  arrogant  in  the  way  they  
speak to older brothers. This is one indication that they do not fear God 
(See Leviticus 19:32). And this is why many preachers fall into sin with 
young sisters.
In 5:3–16, Paul talks about how the church should care for helpless 
widows. In those days, many Christians were being killed for their faith, 
and so there were many widows. Paul said that only widows above the 
age  of  60  should  be  supported  by  the  church,  while  younger  widows  
should be encouraged to get married again. And older widows should be 
supported by the church only if they had no children and grandchildren 
to take care of them. Here is a very important verse that says that if a 
believer does not provide for his own family, he is worse than an unbe-
liever (5:8). Then he gave some conditions. Only those widows should be 
supported who have brought up their children in a godly way, who have 
shown hospitality and who have “washed the feet of the saints” (5:10).
This verse (5:10) proves clearly that the believers in the first century 
did not have the practice (that some have today) of washing each other’s 
feet. Because if all those believers had been practising that, there would 
have  been  no  need  to  make  that  a  condition  for  accepting  a  widow  for  
church-support. When Jesus told His disciples to “do as He had done” 
(John  13:14),  what  He  meant  was  that  they  should  do  (and  always  be  
ready to do) dirty jobs for each other, as He had just done for them. He 
was not prescribing a ritual.
In 5:17–22, Paul gives some important instructions concerning elders 
in the church. Elders must be given “double honour”. That means that 
they must be honoured twice as much as other believers in the church. 
True  elders  will  be  hard-working  like  the  oxen  that  tread  out  the  corn  
and like labourers who work hard (5:18). Such devoted elders who “work 
hard at preaching and teaching” must be given double honour – for this 
is their due, just like a labourer deserves his wages. If you don’t honour 
an elder brother, it would be like cheating a labourer of his wages. Elders 
must be highly appreciated and highly respected.
At the same time, Paul advises Timothy how to deal with elders who 
sin.  First  of  all,  he  tells  Timothy  not  to  “receive  an  accusation  against  
elders unless there are at least two or three witnesses”. If it is then proved 
that they are in sin, then they must be “rebuked publicly, so that others 
will fear”. Elders get double honour – but if they sin, then they must be 
rebuked openly before the church. Paul warns Timothy not to set apart 
elders (“lay hands”) too soon. Prove a man first before setting him apart 
as an elder. Thus Timothy could keep himself from being responsible for 
the sins of elders whom he appoints (5:22).
In 5:23, we see Timothy also had a “thorn in his flesh”. He had frequent 
pain  in  the  stomach.  Obviously  Paul  had  prayed  for  him  numerous  
times, but he was not cured. So Paul urged him to take a little wine as 

832 Through the Bible: The Church and Its Shepherds
1 Timothy
a medicine. Here is an inspired Scripture that teaches us that at times, 
not all sicknesses are cured even in the most godly of men and that we 
should seek medical help and use medicines when we are sick.
In 6:4, Paul warns Timothy not to get involved in controversial ques-
tions.  This  is  a  warning  that  all  elders  need  to  bear  in  mind.  Some  
believers  are  constantly  interested  in  doctrinal  controversies.  Avoid  
such discussions.
Then he urges Timothy to always be content with whatever God has 
provided  for  his  earthly  needs.  He  warns  him  of  the  dangers  there  are  
in pursuing after wealth beyond one’s needs (6:6–10). It is very easy for 
a  Christian  worker  to  become  covetous.  Money  is  a  good  servant  but  
a  terrible  master.  Those  who  long  for  it  will  ruin  themselves  and  have  
many problems, for “the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil”. Many 
who  are  in  Christian  work  have  destroyed  themselves  by  their  love  for  
money. In this area, we are exhorted to “fight the good fight and to lay 
hold of eternal life” (6:12). Eternal life is the life of God Himself and even 
a wholehearted brother like Timothy was urged to seek to possess more 
and more of that life. This is in direct opposition to seeking to lay hold of 
more and more money. We are urged to “remember the confession Jesus 
made before Pontius Pilate” (6:13). The confession Jesus made to Pontius 
Pilate was, “My kingdom is not of this world.” A Christian worker should 
never become rich by preaching the gospel. Rich Christians are urged not 
to trust in their “uncertain riches” but to share their wealth with the poor 
and needy among the believers (6:17).
In  conclusion,  Paul  urges  Timothy  to  “guard  the  sacred  deposit  
entrusted  to  him”  by  God  and  to  steer  clear  of  all  worldly  chatter  and  
arguments (6:20). May the Lord help us also to be faithful until the end.

2 TIMOTHY
A True Servant of God and  
His Ministry
T
his  is  the  last  letter  that  Paul  wrote.  He  knew  that  he  was  going  
to  leave  this  world  soon  and  be  with  his  Lord.  When  he  wrote  
1 Thessalonians he had said, “We who are alive will be caught up.” 
At  that  time,  he  had  felt  that  he  would  be  alive  when  Jesus  returned.  
That is the way every Christian should live. But 12 years later, when he 
wrote this, his last letter, he says, “The time of my departure has come” 
(2 Timothy 4:6).
The  theme  of  2  Timothy  is  “A  true  servant  of  God  and  his  ministry”  –  
which is the basic theme of Paul’s last three letters – to Timothy and Titus. 
Paul’s burden before he left the earth was to prepare another generation 
of leaders to be good shepherds of God’s people. He pointed them to his 
own  life.  Paul  always  pointed  to  his  own  life  as  an  example.  When  he  
spoke to the elders in Ephesus he did not say, “Remember the sermons 
I preached to you”, but rather “Remember the way I lived with you” (Acts 
20:19, 33–35). And he tells Timothy the same thing here, “I thank God 
whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did.” (1:3). 
Paul was not perfect, but to the best of his knowledge, as his conscience 
taught him, he lived an upright life before God.
Paul then speaks endearing words to Timothy, because Timothy was 
the  one  co-worker  who  brought  greatest  delight  to  Paul’s  heart.  Paul 
was  disappointed  with  many  believers  in  many  churches  because  they  
were  not  radical  disciples.  He  was  also  disappointed  with  many  of  his   
co-workers because they did not live utterly and totally for God. Any true 
servant  of  God  will  face  the  same  disappointment  today.  If  Paul  faced  
disappointment with the churches he planted, do you think we are going 
to do any better? I have planted churches and I am disappointed with a 
lot of things I see in some of those churches. I have co-workers and I am 

834 Through the Bible: A True Servant of God and His Ministry 
2 Timothy
disappointed with some of the things I see in some of those co-workers. 
Here and there we find one person like Timothy who does not seek his 
own in anything. Such people bring great delight to the heart of a servant 
of God. 
Paul was excited because he found a few like him who could carry on 
the ministry into the next generation. What brings the greatest delight to 
the heart of any servant of God is to see at the end of his life, that there 
are some who will carry on his ministry with the same spirit and devotion 
to the Lord. Timothy was one like that. That’s why Paul wrote, “I always 
remember you in my prayers, longing to see you. I recall your tears.” That 
must  have  been  the  last  time  he  saw  Timothy.  Now  Paul  thought  he  
might never see him again.
Timothy’s grandmother Lois was the first person that came to faith in 
that family (1:5). His grandmother transmitted her faith to his mother, 
Eunice – and she transmitted it to Timothy. That grandmother gave faith 
to  her  daughter,  not  Scripture-knowledge.  And  that  mother  passed  on  
that faith  to  Timothy.  That  means  as  Timothy  grew  up,  he  must  have  
seen  his  mother  trusting  God  in  different  trials  she  went  through.  Do  
your  children  see  you  trusting  God  in  your  trials?  That’s  how  you  can  
communicate faith to them. That’s why God allows those difficult trials 
to come your way. From a small age your children must know one thing: 
“My Mummy prays and trusts God when she is in a difficult situation. 
When I was sick my Daddy laid hands on my head and prayed for me in 
the Name of Jesus.” When that little child grows up and leaves home one 
day, and he or she faces a difficult situation, they will do exactly what 
their Daddy and Mummy did. They will pray to God in the Name of Jesus. 
That is how we are to communicate faith to them. We must tell them the 
stories in the Bible. That is necessary. That way they will have the knowl-
edge of God’s Word. But we need to communicate faith to them as well. 
Little did Eunice know that this little boy of hers would grow up to be a 
mighty apostle of Jesus Christ. Paul selected Timothy to be his co-worker 
when Timothy was perhaps 20 years old. What a work that mother did 
for the church in her home. You can do the same by bringing up your 
children to trust in the Lord from their childhood.
Timothy’s  father  was  Greek  (Acts  16:3).  Eunice  was  the  daughter  of  
a  Godfearing  Jewish  mother.  But  Eunice  must  have  drifted  from  God  
to have disobeyed the Law and married a Gentile. Later she must have 
repented. Her husband was probably a rich businessman, who had no 
time for God and no interest in bringing up his son in a godly way. So 
Eunice  had  to  raise  Timothy  single  handedly.  Yet  she  brought  him  up  
in such a godly way that he became one of the finest apostles of the 
first century. What an example Eunice is for mothers today who have 
unconverted husbands! Who knows, but God’s plan for that little 4-year-
old  son  of  yours  may  be  that  he  should  become  an  apostle  of  Jesus  
Christ one day! If so, then a great deal depends on you, dear mother, on 

Keep the Fire Burning                                                                                                                              835
2 Timothy
how  you  bring  him  up,  and  whether  you  communicate  faith  in  God  to  
his little heart. Don’t let him hear you backbiting against others in the 
church and complaining and murmuring about things at home. That will 
destroy him.
I was very careful in my home, that my children should never hear me 
speaking evil of other believers, lest they be infected with that disease. 
Just as I did not want any of my children to get tuberculosis or leprosy, 
I did not want them to be infected with negative attitudes towards other 
believers. If we can communicate faith to our children, when they see us 
facing difficulties at home, we would have given them the most important 
gift of all.
In most cases, we have observed that first-generation Christians are 
stronger  in  faith  and  in  devotion  to  the  Lord  than  second-generation  
Christians who grew up in believing homes. But Timothy was an excep-
tion. He was a third-generation believer who was devoted to the Lord. So 
there can be second-generation and third-generation believers who are 
even more devoted to the Lord than their parents were.
Keep the Fire Burning
But Timothy had more than faith. He also had spiritual gifts and Paul 
reminds him of this, “I want to remind you of the spiritual gift you received 
when  I  laid  hands  on  you.”  The  Holy  Spirit  is  not  a  spirit  of  timidity.  
Paul  urged  him  to  stir  up  that  gift  and  to  kindle  it  afresh,  to  keep  the  
fire burning. From this we learn that even though Jesus baptises us in 
the Holy Spirit and fire (Matthew 3:11), we still have to do something to 
keep that fire burning at all times. God lights the fire. We have to keep 
supplying the fuel – a life totally surrendered at all times to God’s will. 
Don’t  imagine  that  just  because  God  anointed  you  once,  that  you  can  
now relax and say, “Once anointed, always anointed”. That is as great a 
fallacy as saying, “Once saved, always saved”. 
I have seen people who were genuinely anointed by God who are spirit-
ually dead one year later. The fire is gone. Worldly interests and pride 
have come in and taken the fire away. They are now running after money 
and a comfortable life, and have lost the fire of God. That is sad and a 
great loss for the kingdom of God. 
So Paul told Timothy, “That fire that came upon you, keep it afresh, 
keep it burning. It is up to you now. If you don’t keep it burning it will 
die  out.  Keep  it  burning  by  keeping  a  good  conscience,  by  studying  
the  word  of  God,  by  humbling  yourself  constantly,  by  seeking  God  
wholeheartedly,  by  staying  away  from  the  love  of  money,  and  from  
arguments with others and from anything that will quench this fire.”
Paul  then  went  on  to  say,  “God  has  not  given  us  a  spirit  of  timidity” 
(1:7). Paul was a fiery person naturally. Barnabas and Timothy however 

836 Through the Bible: A True Servant of God and His Ministry 
2 Timothy
were timid. God puts a fiery person along with a timid person in a ministry 
because they can keep each other balanced. This is the ideal combina-
tion for leadership in any church. 
If the leaders were all like Timothy, the church would be filled with 
wishy-washy compromisers. And if the leaders were all like Paul, hardly 
anybody  would  be  left  in  the  church,  for  most  people  would  have  got  
discouraged and left. But when both types of men are in the leadership, 
it brings a balance of grace and truth! So if you have a co-worker whose 
temperament and gifts are exactly the opposite of yours, that could be 
God’s perfect choice for you. If God gives you a wife who is exactly the 
opposite of you in temperament, that could be God’s perfect choice for 
you. We may have the same devotion to Christ and the same passion to 
live for God, and yet be opposite in temperament. Paul and Timothy had 
the same devotion to Christ, but their temperaments were totally oppo-
site to each other.
I  thank  God  that  in  my  life  He  gave  me  co-workers  who  are  devoted  
to Christ but the opposite of me in temperament and gift – like the left 
hand  and  the  right  hand.  God  knew  what  type  of  co-workers  I  needed  
to  balance  me  out  and  He  has  given  me  co-workers  exactly  like  that.  
I  appreciate them greatly and value them very highly. I could never build 
Christ’s Body without them. We must learn to appreciate the people God 
chooses to be our co-workers.
So to some we say, “Don’t let your natural timidity take over your life.” 
To  others,  we  have  to  say,  “Don’t  let  your  natural  hardness  take  over  
your life.”
Paul says, “God has given us a spirit of power, love and of discipline” 
(1:7). The Spirit of God gives us power, love for others and enables us to 
discipline ourselves. 
Whatever experience of the Holy Spirit you may have had, if you don’t 
allow the Holy Spirit to discipline you – to make you spend your time and 
your money in a disciplined way, and to discipline your speech, you will 
never be what God wants you to be. The greatest servants of God in the 
history of the church were men and women who allowed the Holy Spirit 
to  discipline  their  lives.  They  were  disciplined  in  their  sleeping  habits,  
in  their  eating  habits,  in  prayer  and  in  study  of  the  Scriptures.  They 
were disciplined in putting God first above all their earthly desires. Many 
Christians remain satisfied with having received the baptism in the Holy 
Spirit and they imagine that everything in their lives will flow smoothly 
thereafter. But you need to be disciplined too, if you are to fulfil God’s 
will for your life.
Uphold God’s Standards
Paul goes on to say, “Don’t be ashamed of me, I am a prisoner” (1:8). Many 
believers were proud to be associated with the apostle Paul while he was 

Uphold God’s Standards                                                                                                                          837
2 Timothy
planting churches and doing miracles. But now that he was a prisoner, 
they didn’t want to associate with him because it was shameful. Many 
Christians  will  associate  with  a  preacher  when  he  is  popular.  But  the  
moment he becomes unpopular or rejected, they pull out. But those who 
stuck with Paul till the end were the ones whom God approved and who 
He used to build His church. They were tested through Paul’s unpopu-
larity  and  found  faithful.  God  will  test  us  to  see  whether  we  will  stick  
with a servant of His who is anointed but unpopular. There God finds out 
whether you are seeking your own or whether you will be true to Him.
Then  in  1:12,  Paul  says,  “I  know  whom  I  have  believed  and  I  am  
convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that 
day”  (1:12). He was confident that the Lord would preserve Him unto 
the  end.  The  wholehearted  Paul  could  say  that.  But  if  a  half-hearted  
Christian quotes that verse today, he is deceiving himself.
“Don’t ever lower the standard” is Paul’s next exhortation to Timothy 
(1:13). What a great need there is for that exhortation for all Christian 
preachers  in  our  day:  “Don’t  lower  the  standard  that  you  see  in  the  
Scriptures in order to bring more people into your church. If you have 
less people with a higher standard, you are a better church in the Lord’s 
eyes,  than  if  you  have  more  people  with  a  lower  standard.  It  is  better  
to  have  a  church  with  3  disciples  than  with  300  compromisers.  Three  
wholehearted disciples can influence a whole village for Christ more than 
300 compromising believers. This is the burden that every true servant 
of God must have for the next generation after him. In Christian history, 
we find most often that the second generation of a movement lowers the 
standards, because they don’t have the same vision that their founders 
had. Compare the great denominational churches of today with what they 
were like in the days of their founders. If the founders of those denomi-
nations came to earth today, they would not join the denomination they 
founded – because it has lowered the standard that the founders held up 
and proclaimed. The external form of doctrine may still be there, but the 
power and the anointing are gone. Life has gone, and the knowledge of 
God has gone.
We  must  guard  this  standard  through  the  Holy  Spirit  who  dwells  in  
us, because it is a sacred treasure. If your company gives you five million 
rupees  in  cash  to  be  taken  from  Bangalore  to  Delhi  by  train,  you  will  
guard it very carefully and ensure that when you reach the other end, 
there  is  5  million  with  you  and  not  3  million!  That  is  how  we  have  to  
safeguard God’s standards in His Word. We will never be able to do this 
without the wisdom and power of the Holy Spirit (1:14).
Paul tells Timothy that many believers in Asia Minor had “turned away 
from him” (1:15). Paul in his last days experienced something that Jesus 
also  experienced  –  believers  leaving  him  and  breaking  their  fellowship  
with him. Those believers did not want to associate with Paul now because 
he was in prison. They didn’t want to get into trouble with the Romans. 

838 Through the Bible: A True Servant of God and His Ministry 
2 Timothy
So they kept a little distance from him. Phygelus and Hermogenes who 
left him may have been Paul’s co-workers at one time. But Onesiphorus 
stayed on and was not ashamed of Paul’s chains (1:16). He had served 
Paul in Ephesus and now in Rome, he went and met Paul in prison and 
fellowshipped with him. Praise God for such loyal brothers who stick with 
God’s servants through thick and thin. Paul says, “When Onesiphorus was 
in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me. The Lord grant to him 
to find mercy from the Lord on that final day” (1:18). If you give even a cup 
of cold water to a disciple in Jesus’ Name, you will not lose your reward.
Characteristics of a True Servant of God
In Chapter 2, Paul speaks about the characteristics of a true servant of 
God. 
First of all, a true servant of God must be a faithful teacher of God’s word. 
Paul tells Timothy, “Whatever you heard from me entrust to faithful men 
who will teach others also” (2:2). There we see Paul’s burden to reach the 
fourth  generation  with  the  gospel.  Timothy  (a  second  generation  disci-
ple) was to find faithful men in the third generation (not clever men but 
faithful men) who would go out and find faithful men in the fourth gener-
ation.  God  has  never  looked  for  clever  men  or  rich  men,  but  only  for  
faithful men.
Secondly, a servant of God must be a soldier, who does not get entangled 
with the affairs of this world but is detached from it (2:3, 4). He lives in 
the world but recognising at all times that he is not of the world. A good 
soldier will concentrate on fighting the enemy and winning the battle for 
his country. Other matters will take secondary place in his mind. A true 
servant of God also will have his mind set on establishing the victory of 
Christ  in  the  territory  of  Satan.  In  order  to  do  that,  he  will  seek  to  be  
free from attachment to earthly things. “If you have been raised up with 
Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right 
hand of God. Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are 
on earth” (Colossians 3:1, 2).
Do you want to serve the Lord? Then set your mind primarily on the 
things above and determine to fight the devil and win battles for the 
Lord.  God  will  take  care  of  all  your  earthly  needs.  Many  believers  are  
good soldiers when they are single. But when they get married and have 
a family, they allow their minds to be so taken up with earthly things that 
their love for the Lord cools off. But if you have married in the will of God, 
your devotion to Christ will increase. I was a full-time Christian worker 
even before I got married. My wife and I have brought up four sons who 
have all grown up and are married now. I took care of them and provided 
for  them.  But  at  no  time  did  my  family  become  more  important  to  me  

Characteristics of a True Servant of God                                                                                              839
2 Timothy
than the Lord Himself. My wife and children did not lose out in any way, 
as a result of my putting God first in my life. If you live in the will of God 
you will not suffer spiritually or materially. God is faithful. If you serve 
Him faithfully, do you think He will let your family down? That is impos-
sible. So be a good soldier and seek the kingdom of God first, and you 
will see that God will provide your family with all the things of earth that 
they need. If you live for Him He will not let you down. I am only adding 
my  testimony  to  the  testimony  of  many  servants  of  God  through  2000  
years, who can say the same thing. If you honour God, He will honour 
you. So,“don’t let the world around you squeeze you into its own mould” 
(Romans 12:2 - J.B. Philips).
The third picture he uses here is that of an athlete (2:5). A true servant of 
God must be like an athlete who runs according to the rules. That means 
he  does  not  cheat.  He  does  not  do  something  against  the  rules,  when  
nobody is watching. Consider an Olympic event such as the 50 kilometres 
walk. The walkers have to walk throughout that event and not run even 
one step. But 50 kilometres is a long distance, and I can imagine that 
somewhere along the way, when people are not watching, some walkers 
would be tempted to run a little bit. But there are hidden video cameras 
watching the walkers along the way. And if a walker cheated and came 
in first, he would be disqualified and get no medal. So there must be no 
cheating in the life of a servant of God. There must be no false reporting 
of the results of our ministry. You will never have to tell a lie in the Lord’s 
work. It is only in the devil’s work that people have to tell lies. We must 
be absolutely honest. There must be no cheating in the way we keep our 
financial accounts. It is better to suffer at the hands of men for telling the 
truth than suffer at God’s hands one day for telling a lie.
Fourthly,  we  must  be  like  hard-working  farmers  (2:6).  When  a  farmer  
sows  a  seed  he  doesn’t  come  the  next  morning  to  see  if  the  crop  has  
come. He waits. It takes a long time for the harvest to come, but it does 
come.  Meanwhile  he  waters  the  seeds  and  puts  in  fertilisers.  Farmers  
have to be hard-working people. Otherwise they won’t get a good crop. 
A  servant  of  God  must  be  like  a  hard-working  farmer,  in  his  study  of  
God’s  Word  and  in  his  serving  the  people.  He  works  diligently,  and  so  
many years later he has the joy of seeing the people he served grow up to 
maturity and becoming servants of God themselves. This is the tremen-
dous joy that I have had in the last few years. Young people who have 
grown up to become faithful servants of God.
We  must  meditate  seriously  on  these  word  pictures  and  examine  
ourselves in their light.
Then  Paul  says,  “Remember  Jesus  Christ  risen  of  the  seed  of  David.  
Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything” 
(2:7, 8). Paul reminds Timothy once again that Jesus came in the flesh 

840 Through the Bible: A True Servant of God and His Ministry 
2 Timothy
(the seed of David) and conquered, sin, death and Satan – proved by the 
fact that He was raised from the dead. Thus He paved the way for us also 
to  conquer  these  enemies.  This  is  what  Timothy  needed  to  get  under-
standing from the Lord on – and what we need to get understanding on, 
as well.
Fifthly, a servant of the Lord must be a diligent workman (2:15). He must 
study God’s Word carefully, and handle the truth accurately. Thus alone 
can  he  present  himself  to  God  as  fit  for  His  service.  Have  you  spent  
many hours trying to understand God’s word accurately? If not, how can 
God use you to minister His Word. Whenever you see men expounding 
Scripture  powerfully,  remember  that  this  is  not  only  because  they  are  
anointed by the Spirit, but also because they have worked hard studying 
God’s Word. God is not a rewarder of lazy people! When children come 
to  me  at  examination  time  and  ask  me  to  pray  for  them,  I  ask  them,  
“Did you study hard for the examination?” If they didn’t study, then my 
praying  won’t  help  them.  A  farmer  who  does  not  carefully  sow  seed  at  
sowing time and diligently water it, cannot pray that he should get a good 
harvest. If you want God to use you, you must be diligent in your study 
of the word of God.
In 2:11–13, we read, “If we died with Him, we will also live with Him; If 
we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny 
us; If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” 
If we want the life of Christ to be manifested in us, in our daily life on 
earth, we must first die to ourselves, daily. If we want to reign with Christ 
eternally, we must endure with Him now on earth. If on the other hand, 
we deny Him by the way we live, then we will find that He denies us in 
the final day.
In 2:14, Paul  warns  Timothy,  “Remind  people  of  these  things  and  
solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to argue about words.” 
The two books in the Bible that warn us the most to avoid arguments and 
disputes are 1 and 2 Timothy. Many Christian preachers unfortunately, 
have not taken this command seriously. When preachers come to argue 
with me about some doctrine, the first thing I try to sense is whether he 
is sincerely wanting to know the truth because he wants to live a godly 
life, or whether he is just wanting to argue to prove that I am wrong. If I 
sense that he is really seeking for a godly life, I am willing to spend hours 
with him, explaining the Scriptures. But if I sense that he is only inter-
ested  in  arguing  with  me,  then  I  stop  the  discussion  immediately  and  
change the subject to something more pleasant – so that we don’t spend 
our time arguing.
In 2:16, Paul says again, “Avoid empty worldly chatter, for it will lead 
to  further  ungodliness.”  Remember  that  all  worldly  chatter  and  gossip  
invariably lead to ungodliness. Your speech can be like gangrene (2:17). 
When people suffering from diabetes get a small wound in their foot, it 

Characteristics of a True Servant of God                                                                                              841
2 Timothy
sometimes does not heal – and gangrene sets in and finally the foot has to 
be cut off. Spiritual gangrene is a terrible thing. Arguments and worldly 
chatter can destroy your life and the lives of others as well. So avoid them 
like the plague. Hymenaeus and Philetus were two men who indulged in 
such worldly chatter and arguments and ended up falling away from the 
truth altogether. They even went on to teach that the final resurrection 
had already taken place and were upsetting the faith of many.
Paul then speaks about the firm foundation of God. God’s founda-
tion has two sides to it – the upper side which He alone can see and the 
bottom  side  which  we  can  see.  This  resolves  the  common  argument  in  
Christendom between Calvinism and Arminianism – whether one who is 
saved can be lost. What is the truth? As someone has said, “The truth is 
not found in one extreme or in the other. Much less is it found in the middle. 
The truth is found in both extremes held together.” God is sovereign and He 
chooses us. At the same time we need to seek Him diligently for only then 
will we find Him. He holds on to me. But I must hold on to Him as well. 
He will never divorce me. But I must never divorce Him either. God never 
takes away our free will at any time. If He did, we would become robots.
From God’s side of the foundation, He knows who His children are. If 
we could look into the Book of Life we could tell who all are the children 
of God. But we cannot. We look at it from the underside, and what do we 
see there? “He who names the name of the Lord must stay away from sin” 
(2:19). So if you stay away from sin then you are eternally secure. So we 
see both truths there in God’s foundation – the sovereignty of God and 
the free will of man. The Lord knows those who are His – and those who 
name the name of the Lord stay away from sin. So God holds us and we 
must hold on to Him.
The sixth characteristic of a true servant of God is that he must be a holy 
vessel, a vessel who cleanses himself (2:20, 21). There are two cleansings 
spoken  of  in  the  New  Testament.  One  is  the  cleansing  that  God  does:  
“The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin. If we confess our sin He is 
faithful and righteous to cleanse us” (1 John 1:7, 9). God cleanses us from 
the guilt of sin. We can’t do that. Only the blood of Jesus can do that. The 
second  cleansing  is  something  that  we  have  to  do  ourselves  (“If  a  man  
cleanses himself” – 2:21). These are like two sides of a coin. God cleanses 
away  our  past  sin  and  we  cleanse  ourselves  from  the  wrong  things  we  
see in our lives.
Maybe you have the habit of cracking jokes that hurt others – something 
that Jesus would never do. Don’t ask God to cleanse it away. Say, “Lord, 
I am going to cleanse myself. I am going to give up this bad habit, with 
Your help.” Or perhaps you have a curiosity that makes you a busybody 
in  other  people’s  matters.  You  must  cleanse  yourself  from  being  inter-
ested in matters that do not concern you in any way. If a man cleanses 
himself thus he can be a vessel sanctified and useful to the Master.

842 Through the Bible: A True Servant of God and His Ministry 
2 Timothy
The passion of my life for many years has been to be a vessel useful to 
God for every good work that He can do through me in my one earthly 
life.  We  may  live  at  the  most  80  or  90  years  on  this  earth.  Every  year  
of our lives must count for God. If you want to live such a life, cleanse 
yourself daily. Ask the Lord to show you the things that are useless – and 
cleanse them away. Let your life be one of continuous cleansing. If you 
are serious about this, you will be a vessel useful to the Master. There are 
many vessels in the church that are useless.
Paul compares Christians to different types of vessels in a house. “In a 
wealthy home there are dishes made of gold and silver as well as some 
made  from  wood  and  clay.  The  expensive  dishes  are  used  for  guests,  
and the cheap ones are used in the kitchen or to put garbage in. If you 
stay away from sin you will be like one of these dishes made of purest 
gold – the very best in the house – so that Christ himself can use you for 
his highest purposes” (2:20, 21 - Living).
But don’t think of usefulness alone. Many people are happy to know 
that God is using them. In a house, people use wooden boxes more than 
their golden vessels. But which vessel has more value? Are you concerned 
about your usefulness or your spiritual value? Your spiritual value is far 
more important to God than your usefulness in His work. God uses many 
people to do His work – even the devil. The devil once sent a thorn as a 
messenger into Paul’s flesh – and God used it to keep Paul humble. God 
used Balaam. God used Solomon even to write Scripture; but he went to 
hell after that. So don’t ever glory in the fact that God is using you. Many 
who prophesied and did miracles in Jesus’ Name will be rejected in the 
final day (Matthew 7:22, 23). So being used by God is not the main thing. 
What is your intrinsic worth? Are you a golden vessel?
When there is a fire in a house, people rush to remove their gold and 
silver vessels – not their earthen jars. So will it also be, when the world 
is on fire. “They shall be Mine, says the Lord Almighty, in that day when 
I make up My jewels. Then you will see the difference between those who 
serve  God  and  those  who  don’t”  (Malachi  3:17,  18  -  Living).  If  you  are  
only a cheap earthen vessel at present, you can become a golden vessel 
by  cleansing  yourself  from  everything  that  you  see  as  un-Christlike  in  
your life.
If you decide to cleanse yourself, one of the first things you must run 
away  from  is  youthful  lusts  (2:22).  Even  a  man  like  Timothy  who  was  
about  45  years  old  at  this  time,  had  to  run  away  from  youthful  lusts.  
Paul tells this wholehearted brother Timothy that the only way he could 
escape  sinning  in  this  area  was  by  running  away  from  temptation.  He  
was not to imagine that he was too old to be tempted in this area. Don’t 
imagine that because you are 45 years old you won’t be tempted. Don’t 
allow such sins to drag you down and destroy your ministry.

Final Exhortations                                                                                                                                     843
2 Timothy
“Pursue after righteousness with those who call upon the name of the 
Lord with a pure heart” (2:22). In other words, we must seek for fellow-
ship primarily with those who seek for purity. That will help us to flee 
from sin. Our best friends on earth must be those who desire purity with 
all their hearts. Many believers have lower standards and are not inter-
ested in godliness. But we must spend most of our time with those who 
are seeking to live a holy life.
How can we know if someone has a pure heart? Jesus said that people 
speak out of that which fills their hearts (Matthew 12:34). We know what 
is filling a man’s heart by the things he loves to speak about. If he is 
always talking about money and material things, it is because his heart 
is filled with thoughts of money. On the other hand, when a man wants 
to talk mostly about the Lord, you know that’s what is filling his heart. 
I want to fellowship with those who long to be like Jesus. When we love 
the Lord we love to talk about Him. This is the secret of effective service 
for the Lord.
The seventh characteristic of a servant of God is that he must be a gentle 
counsellor (2:24–26). He must be gentle in the way he speaks to people, 
not argumentative or quarrelsome. You cannot be a servant of God if you 
are a quarrelsome type of person. You must also refuse all foolish argu-
ments (2:23). We are more likely to help people to be free from sin and 
to be delivered from Satan’s grip, if we speak meekly and courteously to 
them (2:24–26).
Final Exhortations
In Chapter 3, Paul speaks about how it will be difficult to be a faithful 
Christian  in  the  last  days.  Because  “men  will  be  lovers  of  themselves” 
(3:2).  Paul  is  not  talking  here  about  the  people  of  the  world.  Worldly  
people have always been lovers of themselves. But here he is talking of 
people who call themselves believers – who “will hold to a form of godli-
ness” (3:5). The form of godliness refers to the doctrine. In the last days, 
evangelical Christians with the right doctrine will still be lovers of money, 
boastful  and  arrogant,  etc.,  (3:2–5).  Doctrine  is  like  the  parts  of  our  
human body. A human body can have all its parts and yet be dead! Even 
so, a Christian can have all his doctrines right and yet lack power. They 
don’t have the power to live for God. If you glory in the fact that all your 
doctrines are right but live for yourself and love money, you are dead.
Here are some characteristics of those who have merely a form of godli-
ness: “Arrogance, ingratitude, inability to get along with others, malicious 
gossiping, evil-speaking, brutality, treachery, conceit, and love of pleas-
ure and comfort more than love of God.” Many who have these qualities 
can  still  imagine  that  they  are  God’s  children,  because  they  have  the  
right doctrines (3:2–5).

844 Through the Bible: A True Servant of God and His Ministry 
2 Timothy
There  are  many  “Christians”  in  the  world  today  who  speak  the  right  
religious  language,  and  yet  have  never  been  delivered  from  living  for  
themselves and for the world and for money. Paul tells Timothy to avoid 
such people. Why should we avoid such people? Because we can get their 
infection otherwise.
Many such preachers go into the homes of weak women who admire 
them  and  captivate  their  minds.  They  visit  the  homes  when  only  the  
women  are  there  and  often  end  up  falling  into  sin  with  them.  Such  
women go to many meetings and keep on listening to many preachers. 
But they never come to an understanding of the truth (3:6, 7). If you are 
a preacher, beware of this habit. Don’t be an effeminate preacher. Be a 
man  of  God.  However,  not  all  women  are  like  that,  for  there  are  many  
excellent, godly sisters in the church.
Paul then quotes the example of Jannes and Jambres, Pharaoh’s magi-
cians, who opposed Moses (3:8). There are people like that today too, who 
have a form of godliness, who will oppose true servants of God. But one 
day God will judge them and their folly will become manifest to all.
In contrast to such preachers, Paul tells Timothy, “You have seen how 
I have lived. You have seen my conduct, my purpose in life, my faith, my 
patience,  my  love,  my  perseverance,  and  all  the  persecution  I  suffered” 
(3:10, 11). Paul was not boasting there. At times, we have to share our 
testimony  with  other  believers  to  challenge  them.  Paul  had  to  remind  
Timothy about his way of life to contrast it with that of other preachers 
who were crooked, but claimed to be servants of God. Paul went on to say 
that all who seek to live a godly life in Christ will be persecuted (3:12). 
But evil men and deceivers will go from bad to worse, deceiving others 
and being deceived themselves. Timothy is warned to steer clear of them 
and to follow what he had learned from his childhood (3:13, 14).
Paul then exhorts Timothy to give himself to the study of the Scriptures, 
which were “breathed out by God Himself” to make us perfect. The same 
Holy  Spirit  Who  inspired  God’s  Word  initially,  uses  it  now  to  teach,  
reprove, correct and equip us to become men and women of God, ready 
for every good work (3:16, 17).
Then Paul gives his concluding word to Timothy, “I am charging you in 
Jesus’ name. Preach the word. Be ready always to preach the word when 
you feel like it and when you don’t feel like it, when it’s convenient and 
when it’s not convenient” (4:1, 2). We must be ready at all times, to preach 
God’s Word; and when we preach, we must not only comfort people with 
God’s Word, but also reprove, rebuke exhort and teach them with great 
patience (4:2). This is because a time will come when people will not be 
willing to listen to “sound doctrine” – which means the hygienic doctrine 
that leads to a godly life. Instead they will want their ears to be tickled by 
preachers who make them happy (with “myths” – techniques learnt from 
psychology) in order to collect money from them (4:3). 

Final Exhortations                                                                                                                                     845
2 Timothy
If you were to go to a Christian bookshop today and look through the 
books being sold there, you will hardly find a single book that can lead 
you  to  a  truly  godly  life.  Most  of  what  is  sold  there  is  useless  trash  –  
about  people’s  experiences  (real  and  imaginary)  that  entertain  you  but  
don’t lead you to godliness. That is because most Christians today are 
not interested in holy living. And so Paul urges Timothy to endure hard-
ship and do the work of an evangelist and to make disciples (this is real 
“evangelism” – Matthew 28:19) and not to waste his time.
Paul then says that he knows his time on earth is over. Looking back 
over his life, he is thankful that he fought the devil and the lusts of his 
flesh, wholeheartedly, that he kept the faith uncorrupted and uncompro-
misingly, and that he finished the course God had for him. He completed 
his earthly ministry. He went to every place that God wanted him to go 
– walking at times, and sometimes through shipwrecks. He was deter-
mined to go everywhere that God wanted him to go. Therefore God had 
laid up for him a crown of righteousness which He will give not only to 
Paul,  but  also  to  all  who  love  His  appearing  (4:8).  But  Paul  had  some  
disappointments with his co-workers too. Demas deserted him, seeking 
the  glory  of  this  world  –  probably  money  –  like  many  preachers  today  
(4:10). Alexander the coppersmith did him much harm. But Paul would 
not take any revenge. He would leave it to the Lord to repay him in the 
final day (4:14). When Paul was taken to court everybody deserted him, 
but  the  Lord  stood  with  him  and  saved  him  (4:17). Paul  did  not  want  
the  Lord  to  save  him  from  martyrdom  but  only  from  “every  evil  deed” 
(4:18). Thus the Lord would give him a glorious entrance into His heav-
enly kingdom. What a wonderful way to end one’s life.
We thank God for the example of such a godly servant who kept the 
faith until the end, fought the good fight, and finished his course. May 
we follow in his footsteps.



TITUS
Elders – And What They  
Should Teach
T
he subject of Paul’s letter to Titus is again the church and its elders. 
These three letters – 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus – relate to the 
church and its leadership. The first thing Paul seeks to do is to 
establish order in the church. In Chapter 1, Paul speaks about appoint-
ing godly elders who can lead the church and silence rebellious people; in 
Chapter 2 he speaks about sound doctrine and in Chapter 3 about doing 
good works.
Working Together Despite Differences
Some of Paul’s close workers like Titus were not Jews. Paul himself was 
a very strong Jew, a Pharisee of the Pharisees. But his constant travelling 
companion  was  a  Greek  doctor  named  Luke,  who  wrote  the  Gospel  of  
Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. The other person he worked so closely 
with was Timothy. He was half Greek, his father being a Greek. Titus was 
also a Greek. So these four people from different communities working 
together – Paul, Titus, Timothy and Luke – were a living demonstration 
of the gospel of the new covenant where people of different nationalities 
could work as one.
If  you  can  work  only  with  people  of  your  own  culture  and  national-
ity,  something  is  wrong  with  your  Christianity.  If  you  are  a  Malayalee  
and  you  can  only  work  with  Malayalees  you  haven’t  understood  the  
gospel.  The  gospel  made  Paul  work  with  people  of  different  languages  
and  different  nationalities.  We  must  be  willing  to  work  with  people  of  
any nationality or temperament, if they are disciples of Jesus – whether 
they be Chinese, African, Russian, South American or North American, 
whether  they  be  introverts  or  extroverts.  Temperament  and  nationality  

848 Through the Bible: Elders – And What They Should Teach 
Titus
may all be different, and yet they can be close co-workers. We must get 
out of the sectarian, communal, narrow way of thinking that makes us 
comfortable  only  with  people  of  our  own  nationality  and  temperament  
and we must learn to work with all who are in the Body of Christ.
There are some peculiar traits that people of certain nationalities and 
communities have. But when they come to Christ they can be delivered 
from those traits. Paul told Titus, when Titus was in Crete, that one of 
the Cretan religious preachers had said, “Cretans are liars, evil as beasts, 
lazy and gluttonous” (1:12). That may have been true. But when such a 
Cretan comes to Christ and is filled with the Holy Spirit, he won’t be a 
liar or evil, he won’t behave like a beast, he won’t be lazy and he won’t be 
a glutton. So we must never judge a person according to his nationality 
or community. If we are prejudiced against any Christian because of his 
community, we will remain spiritually poor.
God has made me immensely rich spiritually, through fellowship with 
people  of  different  nationalities  and  communities  –  Chinese,  Africans,  
Indians  of  different  races,  Europeans,  Americans,  etc.  My  heart  has  
always  been  open  to  God’s  people  from  all  communities  and  nations  –  
because  I  know  that  godliness  is  not  found  in  any  particular  nation.  
I have noticed that people from certain wealthy countries are very arro-
gant.  But  the  true  believers  from  those  countries  are  humble.  So  the  
Cretans may be liars, but the Christians in Crete are not liars. People of 
some communities have very poor family values. But the Christians from 
those communities need not be like the others. So we should never judge 
a Christian by the community he comes from. He is a new creation. That 
is why Paul had no problem with having some of his closest co-workers 
from other nationalities.
If you are unwilling to work with people who are different from you in 
the Body of Christ, you will not be able to fulfil the whole purpose of God 
for your life. God will not then show you who your co-workers should be – 
because in His plan, He may want you to work with somebody of another 
nationality, or from another part of India, and He sees that you are not 
willing to accept His plan.
There  are  many  wrong  attitudes  in  us  that  need  to  be  broken  down  
before we can work together with others in the Body of Christ, without 
any distinction of any sort. If we have a preference to work only with 
people of the same type as us, God will not guide us. We may choose 
our co-workers ourselves and say that the Lord led us to them – but it 
won’t be true. It would have been our own carnal preferences that led 
us. We chose them because they were of the same intellectual level, or 
of the same community, or of the same temperament as us. That type 
of union is all right for marriage. But when working for God, we have 
to be open to anyone whom God chooses as our co-workers.

Godliness                                                                                                                                                    849
Titus
Godliness
Paul begins his letter by saying, “I am speaking here as a bond servant of 
Christ for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth 
which is according to godliness” (1:1). We notice, as Paul approaches the 
end of his life, his letters contain a great emphasis on godliness of life. 
Consider these last three letters of Paul – 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus. 
How  much  does  he  speak  in  these  letters  about  speaking  in  tongues?  
Nothing. Or about physical healing? Nothing. Or about financial prosper-
ity? Nothing. Consider John’s first epistle, that he wrote towards the end 
of his life. How much does John speak in it about speaking in tongues, or 
physical healing, or financial prosperity? Nothing. These apostles, when 
they  came  to  the  end  of  their  lives  emphasised  the  things  that  were  of  
fundamental importance – not these other secondary matters that many 
Christians emphasise these days.
What  does  John  speak  about  in  his  letter?  Obedience.  What  does  
Paul  speak  about  in  his  last  three  letters?  “Godliness”  (11  times)  –  
“The  secret  of  godliness”  (1  Timothy  3:16),  “The  power  of  godliness” 
(2 Timothy 3:5), “The truth according to godliness” (Titus 1:1). Whereas 
in his earlier letters, Paul never used the word “godliness” even once. 
Paul would say at the end of his life, as a mature apostle, “I have spoken 
about many things earlier – about the return of our Lord, speaking in 
tongues, healings, miracles, etc. But as I come to the end of my life, 
I  see the great need to stress godliness as primary and foundational to 
everything else.” We can know that we have become mature when we 
also stress godliness in our ministry. Without godliness, we will not be 
able build the church of Jesus Christ today – even if we have all the 
gifts of the Spirit and financial prosperity! We are not against the gifts 
of the Spirit. We need them all. But our primary emphasis must be on 
godliness of life. The man I would listen to, is the mature man who has 
seen  the  importance  of  what  Paul  and  John  saw  towards  the  end  of  
their lives – godliness. So today, when you hear preachers preaching so 
many things, compare them with these apostles, and you will be able 
to identify who is really mature.
Qualifications for Elders
Paul tells Titus that he left him in Crete to “set in order the things that are 
wrong,  and  appoint  elders  in  every  city”  (1:5).  Paul  was  also  concerned  
towards the end of his life that in every church there must be elders in 
the leadership. The Holy Spirit always seeks to appoint more than one 
elder in every church – and never a single pastor. Paul did not tell Titus 
to appoint a pastor in every church. There must be at least two elders 
leading every church – so that church-leadership is balanced. One-man 
leadership  will  make  a  church  imbalanced.  Under  the  old  covenant,  

850 Through the Bible: Elders – And What They Should Teach 
Titus
leadership was always exercised by one man – one high-priest, one king 
and  one  prophet.  But  as  soon  as  Jesus  started  His  ministry,  He  sent  
His disciples out two-by-two. That was the beginning of Body ministry – 
which would be one of the distinctive features of the new covenant, from 
the day of Pentecost onwards.
The elders in a church must be the most spiritually mature persons in 
that church and not necessarily those who are oldest in age. But what 
do  we  see  today?  Young,  immature  men  become  pastors  of  churches  
after getting a degree from some Bible school. Most people sitting in their 
churches are far more mature than them. That is not the church of Jesus 
Christ,  but  an  organisation.  In  the  church  of  Jesus  Christ,  those  who  
know God the best are the elders.
Maturity  is  not  determined  by  preaching  ability  or  by  gift.  Even  a  
15-year old boy can engage in evangelism. But maturity comes through 
faithfulness over many years. The qualifications of an elder are listed here 
in 1:6-9. We saw some of these qualities in 1 Timothy too. An elder must 
have a good testimony in the neighbourhood. He must be the husband of 
one wife. His children (who are at home) must love the Lord and not be 
wild or disobedient. If a man cannot control his own children, how will 
he  be  able  to  control  the  church  of  God?  There  is  a  great  emphasis  in  
the New Testament on the way a man brings up his children as a quali-
fication for church leadership. A  believer’s  children  are  a  testimony  as  
to how he has lived at home. The children of some believers misbehave 
perpetually, whereas the children of other believers are always well-be-
haved. This has nothing to do with the children. It has to do with how the 
parents have brought them up.
Some  parents  are  so  undisciplined  that  they  allow  their  children  to  
do anything they want in the church service and when visiting people’s 
homes. Such brothers are totally unfit to have any responsibility in the 
church  of  God.  A  man  who  is  an  elder  in  the  church  must  have  disci-
plined children, who learn to sit quietly in the meeting even when they 
are small. An elder whose children are constantly running around during 
the church-service should resign and hand over his eldership to someone 
else who can control his children. If a man cannot discipline his children 
he cannot lead a church. He may be able to preach, but he cannot be a 
leader. Those who seek to have responsibility in the church must first 
learn to be good leaders in their own home. 
“He must not be one who is quick tempered and angry” (1:7). A   quarrel-
some,  short-tempered  man  is  not  fit  to  be  an  elder.  He  is  fit  to  be 
a  terrorist,  not  a  church-elder.  Elders  in  churches  must  be  peace- 
loving men.
“They must not be greedy for money” (1:7). They must have no interest 
in getting money from people.

Qualifications for Elders                                                                                                                           851
Titus
“They  must  be  hospitable”  (1:8).  Their  home  must  be  open  to  people  
who need spiritual help.
“They must love what is good, sensible, righteous and devout; and they 
must be self-controlled” (1:8).
“They must hold fast the faithful word in accordance with the teaching, 
so that they can exhort with sound (hygienic) doctrine and thus refute 
those  who  contradict”  (1:9).  The  word  used  to  describe  pure  doctrine  
is  the  Greek  word  “hugiaino”  from  which  we  get  the  English  word  
“hygienic.”  This  is  a  word  that  Paul  uses  frequently  in  his  letters  to  
Timothy and Titus.
Hygiene  is  what  a  good  hospital  has  that  keeps  everything  free  from  
germs,  by  frequently  cleaning  the  floors  and  sterilising  their  equip-
ment. If we ever have to go to a hospital, we would all choose a hygienic 
hospital. The church we choose to be a part of should also be like that 
– one that emphasises holiness. Unfortunately, many churches are like 
some government hospitals in India, where people who go for treatment 
acquire sickness that they never had when they entered that hospital!! 
A new believer goes to such a church and learns to gossip and backbite 
–  because  they  don’t  have  any  hygienic  standards  in  that  church.  The  
church that pleases God is a church that majors on godliness.
“There  are  many  rebellious  men,  empty  talkers  and  deceivers,  whose  
mouths must be silenced” (1:10, 11). We must never stand in the pulpit 
and bore people in a church meeting. If you have nothing to say, don’t 
say it in the pulpit!! It is a crime to waste people’s time like that. It is 
the responsibility of the elder to ensure that such people are silenced.
Then there are the deceivers who need to be silenced. “Such teachers 
are only after your money” (1:11 - LB). They are not interested in leading 
people to a godly life. If a preacher comes to your church and he is mostly 
interested in collecting money, the best thing to do would be to send him 
away as soon as possible. That will be for his good as well as the good of 
your church.
As we have studied through the New Testament, have you noticed how 
much it speaks about being free from the love of money? This is a very 
important subject under the new covenant. So, if you are a true servant of 
God, you will speak frequently about the love of money and warn people 
against it. But I find very little preaching about that today, because most 
preachers and pastors themselves are lovers of money. That’s why they 
can’t speak about it and expose this gross sin that is ruining churches 
today.
Paul  asked  Titus  to  reprove  the  Cretans  so  that  they  could  become  
sound in the faith (1:13). Imagine how difficult it must have been for the 

852 Through the Bible: Elders – And What They Should Teach 
Titus
church in Crete to be a light in the midst of the Cretan society that was 
filled with liars, evil people and lazy gluttons. In our society, the sins 
may be different. But in every area of sin that our society specialises in, 
the church must stand out as different – as a light. If for example, in our 
society, the husband is like a king who never does any dirty jobs in the 
house, then Christian husbands must be different. In Indian society the 
husband  usually  never  changes  a  baby’s  diapers  and  he  never  goes  to  
the toilet and cleans his little child’s bottom. All that is supposed to be 
the  wife’s  job.  Why  is  that?  Didn’t  the  husband  and  wife  produce  that  
child together? Then why can’t the husband also do these dirty jobs? In 
such an Indian culture, Christian husbands must stand out as different. 
Since they were co-workers with their wives in producing their children, 
they must be co-workers with their wives in every aspect of bringing up 
those children. We must be different from the darkness around us.
In 1:15,  Paul  says,  “If  you  are  pure,  all  things  are  pure  to  you.  But  if  
you are defiled, you find that nothing is pure, everything is defiled to you.” 
Some people see filth everywhere, because their mind is filthy. That’s 
how  our  minds  have  been  corrupted  by  the  devil.  We  must  now  allow  
the Holy Spirit to purify our minds so that we don’t see something dirty 
where  there  is  nothing  dirty,  and  that  we  don’t  always  impute  a  bad  
motive to what we see others do. Proverbs 27:19 says, “As in water face 
reflects face, so the heart of man reflects man”. What that means is that 
you see in others the evil lurking in your own heart. If you do most things 
with wrong motives, then when you see someone doing something good, 
you  will  attribute  a  wrong  motive  to  him.  If  you  preach  only  to  make  
money, then you will imagine that every preacher preaches only to make 
money. This is because you are seeing the reflection of your own heart 
in the hearts of others. That person may not be impure like you, but you 
will imagine that he is. If however your mind is pure, you won’t go around 
judging people like that. You will attribute good motives to people.
Juniper  belonged  to  the  brotherhood  of  Francis  of  Assisi  in  the  13
th
 
century, that had decided to live in great simplicity in all areas. One day 
when Juniper saw one of his brothers dressed in a relatively expensive 
dress, he said to himself, “Perhaps under that expensive dress he has 
a humbler heart than I have under my simple dress.” Juniper was pure 
and so all things were pure to him. He did not judge anyone. But those 
whose minds are corrupt will see corruption in the motives of others. 
They see the corrupt motives in their own heart reflected in others! 
When Isaiah saw the glory of God, he heard the seraphs saying, “Holy, 
holy, holy is the LORD. The whole earth is full of His glory?” (Isaiah 6:3). 
But when we look at the earth, we don’t see it full of God’s glory but full 
of corruption. The angels in heaven however see the earth as full of God’s 
glory.  Those  angels  have  a  different  opinion  from  man,  because  their  

Hygienic Doctrine                                                                                                                                     853
Titus
minds  are  pure.  They  see  the  glory  of  God  in  many  things,  such  as  in  
the beauty of creation, and in godly believers here and there. They also 
prophetically see the future day when the earth will be filled with the 
glory of God.
Hygienic Doctrine
In 2:1, Paul speaks about hygienic doctrine again. He is not referring now 
to the doctrines of forgiveness, justification, baptism in the Holy Spirit, 
water baptism, the coming of the Lord, the church and its eldership. He 
is talking now about the Christian’s daily life. He urges Titus to “teach the 
people hygienic doctrine” – and then mentions different groups of people.
The older men must be taught to be dignified, sensible, sound in faith, 
full of love and patience. Older people should love younger people who 
are ignorant, immature and foolish. An older man who cannot love is not 
really dignified. Something is wrong with him.
Older women must be reverent in their behaviour. They should not be 
malicious gossips. They must be taught to do good. Older sisters must be 
the teachers of the younger sisters (2:4). What should they teach? They 
should teach the younger sisters how to love their husbands, how to love 
their children, how to be sensible and pure, and how to be workers at 
home (2:5). Mothers must be taught not to neglect their homes and their 
children,  by  going  to  work  merely  to  raise  their  living-standards.  They  
must give priority to their homes. Wives must be taught to be subject to 
their own husbands – so that the word of God is not dishonoured. These 
are the important things that older sisters should be teaching younger 
sisters – and they don’t need a Bible-college degree to teach all this. This 
is real hygienic teaching. But unfortunately, what we see around us is 
many older sisters being experts in gossiping and backbiting. This is sad 
– and it dishonours God.
Hygienic doctrine is practical Christianity and it relates to life. It teaches 
us to love, to be sensible, to give priority to our home-life, to bring up 
children in a godly way, to love husbands and children, to be workers 
at home, etc. In these days, many mothers have neglected their child-
ren by going to work – and thus their children go astray.
I am preaching only what I have practised. I married a medical doctor 
in 1968. As a servant of the Lord, working among students and in the 
villages  primarily,  I  was  extremely  poor  when  we  started  our  married  
life. Once God gave us our first child, my wife stopped working in the 
hospital.  God  gave  us  four  sons  and  my  wife  spent  her  days  bringing  
them all up in godly ways. She never earned one rupee as a doctor, after 
our first child was born. But she has helped and counselled hundreds 
of  women  and  children  with  her  medical  knowledge.  We  decided  that  

854 Through the Bible: Elders – And What They Should Teach 
Titus
our  children  were  more  important  than  money.  Now,  after  47  years  of  
marriage, we can see the results: All our sons are born again and living 
for the Lord. They have married godly women and are raising godly child-
ren themselves. We don’t have any regrets today that we chose to raise 
godly children instead of trying to earn more money to have a luxurious 
life-style. We lived simply and God gave us grace to bring up our children 
to live for Him.
Your  children  are  far  more  important  than  your  standard  of  living.  
Millions of rupees you earn can never be a substitute for godly child-
ren. So I say to all mothers and wives: Don’t neglect your children. As 
it says here in God’s Word: “Be a worker at home first.” If your children 
have grown up and left home, then you can go to work. And if you are 
an older sister you should be able to teach a younger sister how to be 
a worker at home, by your own example. That is God’s way. I recognise 
that there can be exceptions to this, such as, if a husband is an invalid 
or  sick,  and  his  wife  has  to  go  to  work  to  earn  their  living.  But  that  
must be the exception and not the rule.
Young  men  must  be  taught  to  be  sensible.  This  is  hygienic  doctrine.  
Paul  urges  Titus  himself  to  be  a  good  example  –  in  good  deeds,  in  
purity, in pure doctrine, dignified and sound in speech – so that the 
devil cannot point out anything in him that will bring disgrace to the 
Name  of  the  Lord.  Satan  should  not  be  able  to  point  out  your  home  
and say to God, “God, look at that Christian family. See that mother 
who is only interested in making more and more money and see how 
rebellious her children are, without any respect for parents or for the 
church.” Don’t let the enemy have anything to say about you that will 
bring shame on the Lord’s Name. Your children are a reflection of the 
values you have in life. You can pretend to be a spiritual man and fool 
everyone  in  the  world.  But  you  can’t  fool  your  children.  They  know  
what your values are and what you are living for.
Christian servants (and this includes those working in offices and facto-
ries today) must be taught to be subject to their masters in everything. 
They must not argue with their bosses. How many preachers are there 
who tell people they must not argue with their bosses in the factory or 
office? When a Christian argues with his boss in the factory or office, he 
is a disgrace to the name of Jesus. I am not saying he should not stand 
up for his convictions when he is asked to do something wrong. That we 
must  do.  I  remember  when  I  was  in  the  Navy,  there  were  a  number  of  
occasions when I had to stand up to my senior officers and say, “I am 
sorry, Sir. I am a Christian and I cannot do that because it is against my 
conscience.” But we must never be argumentative.

Concluding Exhortations                                                                                                                         855
Titus
Here is another important exhortation to servants (and to workers in 
offices): “Don’t pilfer” (2:10). What is the difference between pilfering and 
stealing? Stealing refers to expensive items that are taken unrighteously 
for  oneself.  Pilfering  refers  to  minor  items  –  such  as  taking  a  sheet  of  
office-paper to write a private letter. It’s in such small matters that we 
discover whether we are godly or not. Jesus said, “If you are faithful in 
little  things,  you  will  be  faithful  in  much.” If  you  have  pilfered  things  in  
the past from somewhere, you should calculate the approximate cost of 
what  you  pilfered  and  give  back  the  money.  That  is  true  Christianity.  
That is what Zaccheus did. I am preaching what I have practiced all my 
Christian  life  –  and  today  my  conscience  is  absolutely  clear.  It  is  thus  
that  we  are  to  “adorn  the  doctrine  of  God  our  Saviour  in  every  respect” 
(2:10). Just as ladies adorn themselves with jewellery, Christians must 
adorn the doctrines they preach with a Christlike life.
“The grace of God has come teaching us to deny ungodliness and worldly 
desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in this present age, 
looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great 
God and Saviour Christ Jesus” (2:11–13). Here is a passage that speaks 
about  what  God  has  done  for  us  in  the  past  –  He  brought  salvation; 
what He is doing for us in the present – enabling us to live life denying 
all ungodliness; and what we are looking forward to in the future – the 
return of our Lord.
Here we are told clearly why Christ gave Himself for us (2:14). So that 
He might purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for 
good works. If you have been saved by Christ, you should be a person 
who is eager to do good. That is hygienic doctrine. Hygienic doctrine goes 
beyond justification, water-baptism and the baptism in the Holy Spirit. 
It is practical Christianity in daily life. Any doctrine that does not lead 
a  person  to  a  godly  life  is  not  hygienic  doctrine,  but  a  doctrine  of  the  
slums – similar to filthy hospitals that don’t sterilise their equipment 
for surgery and that don’t clean their floors. Such is a filthy church that 
does  not  lead  its  people  to  a  godly  life.  Hygienic  doctrine  is  the  great-
est need in the church today. And so Paul urges Titus to “Speak these 
things, exhort, reprove people with all authority” (2:15). The great need in 
Christian homes, Christian churches and Christian pulpits in our day, 
is, “godly authority.” Speak in such a way that people will not think that 
“what you say is unimportant” (2:15 - LB).
Concluding Exhortations
Paul then goes on to deal with the subject of how Christians must relate 
to earthly rulers and authorities. We must “be subject to them, obedient to 
them and ready to do every good deed” (3:1). Then comes this verse that 

856 Through the Bible: Elders – And What They Should Teach 
Titus
I have encouraged Christians to write down and hang up in their dining 
rooms and sitting rooms: “Speak evil of no one” (3:2). Haven’t we all seen 
notices sometimes in offices that say, “Thank you for not smoking?” What 
about having a notice that says, “Thank you for not gossiping.” There is so 
much of gossiping that goes on in Christian homes. It’s much worse than 
smoking. I would rather have someone smoke than gossip in my house. 
Is that your view too? If you can request a person not to smoke in your 
house, why can’t you request him not to gossip there? 
“Speak evil of no one, don’t be contentious, be gentle showing consider-
ation for all men, because once upon a time we also were foolish” (3:2, 3). 
We were all foolish like that once – and not only foolish, but disobedient, 
deceived, enslaved, spending our life in malice and envy, and hating one 
another. But the kindness and grace of God saved us from all that. And 
he saved us not on the basis of any good works we did, but through His 
mercy and grace alone. This is the first thing that Paul always empha-
sised – that our salvation is not the result of our righteousness or good 
deeds,  but  the  free  gift  of  God’s  grace.  Then  God  renewed  us  through  
the Holy Spirit – and here Paul refers to the secret of the Christian life 
– the filling of the Holy Spirit. This is the second thing that Paul always 
emphasised. 
Paul then urges Titus to preach all this “confidently – with assurance 
and conviction” (3:8). An actor once said “The difference between us actors 
and  preachers  is  this:  Preachers  talk  about  real  things  as  though  they  
were unreal, while we actors talk about unreal things as though they were 
real”!!  That  is  true  about  most  of  the  preachers  I  have  heard.  There  is  
no fire, or zeal, or earnestness in their ministry. They talk about eternal 
things, about eternal life and about a hell where people burn forever – 
in such a sleepy, sluggish way. Who will believe such preachers? Don’t 
ever be a preacher like that. If you are not sure that the Bible is God’s 
Word,  then  don’t  ever  preach.  Go  and  do  business  or  engage  in  some  
other profession. But don’t open your mouth and confuse people in the 
church. If you preach God’s Word, it must always be with confidence and 
authority.
I  believe  with  all  my  heart  that  the  Bible  is  God’s  inspired,  infallible  
Word. That is why I speak from it confidently. I used to preach from it, 
confidently,  when  I  started  preaching,  more  than  50  years  ago  and  I 
preach from it even more confidently today – because I am more convinced 
about its truthfulness today. In my lifetime, I have proved that the prom-
ises in God’s Book are all true. The Bible is not a bunch of fairy tales but 
God’s eternal truth. The great tragedy in Christendom today, is that we 
don’t have enough preachers who speak with Divine authority.
Another thing that Paul exhorts people about, towards the end of his 
life is to “avoid arguments over unanswerable questions and controver-
sial  theological  ideas  –  for  they  will  lead  to  quarrels  and  will  only  do  

Concluding Exhortations                                                                                                                         857

harm” (3:9 - Living). And so, “if anyone is argumentative and causing 
strife and divisions, he should be given a first and a second warning. 
After that you must have nothing more to do with him, for such a person 
is perverted, sinning, and has condemned himself” (3:10, 11).
A stranger once came to my home to try and convince me that Christians 
should not take medicines when they are sick, but only trust the Lord 
to heal them. I told him that I disagreed with him and would not get into 
an argument with him about it. I said, “Let’s talk about Jesus, about His 
word and His work”. I told him that if he was willing to restrict himself 
to those topics, we could talk. But within two minutes he went back to 
the subject of “healing without medicine”. I gave him a second warning 
and told him that if he was going to argue about that topic, then I would 
have to request him to leave my house. So I talked about the Lord for two 
minutes and again he went back to his old topic. So I got up and escorted 
him to the door and said “Goodbye. God bless you.” I obeyed the above 
Scripture. I am not interested in arguing with anyone about matters that 
are not central to living a godly life.
Paul concludes with a final exhortation to urge God’s people to engage 
in good works (3:14).



PHILEMON
Compassion for a Converted Slave
T
his is a brief letter of Paul’s with just one chapter of 25 verses. He 
wrote this to a rich brother, Philemon. Apphia (1:2) was probably 
his wife. Archippus, whom we considered in Colossians 4:17, was 
probably his son. Philemon probably lived in Colossae. He was probably 
an elder in that church and the church may have been meeting in his 
house. There are some beautiful things we see in this brief letter.
First of all Paul says, “I thank God for you, and I pray for you regularly.” 
It is a great encouragement to anyone if he knows that a servant of God is 
praying for him. We pray for people we love. If you look at the list of people 
you pray for, you will see that you love all of them. There are many other 
people whom we don’t love so much and so we don’t pray for them. We 
are human and so we cannot love everyone equally. Paul loved Philemon, 
and  prayed  for  him.  Philemon  must  have  been  greatly  encouraged  to  
know that this great apostle Paul found time to pray for him, Paul goes 
on to say, “I thank God for your love and faith and I have had a lot of joy 
and comfort in knowing that you are a blessing to the saints” (1:5–7). Paul 
was not flattering him. Paul never flattered. He was encouraging him with 
words of appreciation – a godly habit that we must all learn from Paul.
A Plea for Onesimus
Philemon  was  a  godly  man,  and  he  was  very  hospitable  to  the  many  
poor  believers  who  came  to  his  home.  Paul  then  went  on  to  make  his  
request. He said, “I could order you to do it, in the name of Christ because 
it is the right thing for you to do, but I prefer to appeal to you” (1:8). Paul 
is  now  an  old  man  in  jail  for  the  gospel’s  sake  and  his  only  request  to  
Philemon is that he will show some kindness to Onesimus, whom Paul 
had  won  to  the  Lord  while  in  jail  (1:10).  He  reminds  Philemon  that  he  
owed his life to Paul (1:19). He had been saved through Paul’s ministry. 

860 Through the Bible: Compassion for a Converted Slave
Philemon
And so Paul could have ordered him to do something. But he would not 
order him. Instead he begged him. See the graciousness of this mighty 
servant of God – a wonderful example for all of us to follow. People who 
are converted through our ministry respect us so highly that they may 
be willing to do anything for us. I know people like that who are willing 
to lay down even their lives for me. If I order them to do something, they 
will do it. But I will never order them to do anything. I will beseech them. 
That is the way a true servant of God acts. He never takes advantage of 
his authority. Let us all learn to be gracious, as Paul was.
What does Paul want from Philemon? Onesimus was his slave who had 
run away from him and gone to Rome. There, in the sovereignty of God, 
he came in touch with Paul and was converted. 
In  those  days,  if  a  slave  ran  away  from  his  master,  the  law  permit-
ted the master to kill him when he found him. Slaves had no rights in 
those days. When Paul asked Philemon for a favour he was not asking 
anything for himself. He was asking for somebody else. He was a godly 
man  who  would  never  ask  a  favour  for  himself.  He  told  Philemon  that  
when Onesimus came back to him, he was coming back as a brother in 
Christ. Once he was only a slave. Now he is a brother as well. God used 
his running away so that he could come back as a brother (1:15). Paul 
beseeches Philemon to accept Onesimus as a brother for Paul’s sake. The 
name Onesimus means “Useful” – and Paul says that he would be really 
useful to Philemon now.
Paul  is  essentially  telling  Philemon,  “Suppose  you  saw  me  coming  
toward your house, how would you receive me? Please receive Onesimus 
in exactly the same way.” This reminds us of how Jesus speaks about 
us to the Father. “Father, this child ran away from the house, lived in 
sin and lived a godless life. But I found him and I have brought him 
back. Please accept him, as You accept Me.” And that is how we are 
accepted. The Father loves us and accepts us now, just as He loves and 
accepts Jesus (John 17:23). 
Then Paul says, “If Onesimus has cheated you and robbed something 
from your house, whatever the amount may be, charge it to my account. 
I will repay it.” And that is what Jesus also said, “Charge those sins he 
has  committed  to  My  account.”  This  is  the  attitude  of  every  godly  man:  
“Charge it to my account, I will repay you whatever he owes you.” What 
an attitude to have to help a man whom Paul had led to the Lord. Here is 
a preacher who, instead of asking for money for himself, offers money to 
a believer!! Have you ever seen a preacher like that?
Remember  that  Paul  was  not  a  rich  man  getting  money  from  the  
churches. But with the little he had earned with his tent-making busi-
ness, he said to Onesimus, “I will help you with what I have. I will help 
you  clear  your  debt.”  What  an  example!  If  only  we  had  more  preachers  

Focusing on God’s calling                                                                                                                        861
Philemon
who were eager to help poor people instead of collecting money from poor 
people, what a different Christianity this world would have seen.
Focusing on God’s calling
Paul was reasonable. He did not tell Philemon to share his property with 
Onesimus. No. For Onesimus was still a slave. Paul did not carry on a 
crusade  against  slavery  in  those  days.  He  had  the  discernment  of  the  
Holy Spirit to know that the time was not yet ripe for that. If Paul had 
started a crusade against slavery he would not have been able to concen-
trate on writing Scripture and building the church.
To carry on a crusade against slavery is a good thing. But Paul knew that 
that was not his calling. Some are called to do that. President Abraham 
Lincoln  of  the  United  States  of  America  did  that  many  centuries  later.  
The good can often be the enemy of the best. Paul sought to understand 
God’s mind in his ministry and He knew that God had called him to do 
something better than social service – which would benefit people only in 
this world. Paul knew that God had called him to make disciples and to 
build the church – for that would bring eternal results.
That is something that we must remember today too. You can be taken 
up  with  some  social  cause  or  with  liberation  theology  –  all  of  which  
may be good to help people in this earthly life. But in being occupied 
thus with a good thing, you can miss the best that God wants you to be 
engaged in. The best thing is to make people disciples of Jesus Christ 
and to build His church.
Thereafter,  whenever  the  church  met  in  Philemon’s  house,  he  and  
Onesimus  were  brothers  –  Brother  Onesimus  and  Brother  Philemon.  
But once the church-meeting was over, it was Onesimus the slave and 
Philemon the master once again. What a wonderful demonstration that 
was of the glory of Christ!
The Lord did not come to abolish all social distinctions or to equalise 
the wealth of all Christians. He did not come to get the rich to distribute 
their wealth to the poor. That is Communism – and Christianity is not 
Communism.  Onesimus  and  Philemon  were  not  equal  in  their  earthly  
rank or in their privileges or in their wealth. In all those areas they differed 
from each other, throughout their earthly lives. But they were equal and 
one  as  brothers  in  Christ.  The  letter  to  Philemon  is  the  one  portion  of  
inspired Scripture that clearly teaches that the Holy Spirit does not teach 
Communism – and that He does not want Christians to be Communists.



HEBREWS
Jesus – The Mediator of  
a Better Covenant
I
f  you  are  using  a  KJV  Bible,  you  will  see  at  the  top,  ‘The  Epistle  of  
Paul to the Hebrews.’ But that is not correct. There is no record within 
this  letter  as  to  who  wrote  it  or  to  whom  it  was  written.  Whenever  
Paul  wrote  a  letter  he  always  put  his  name  at  the  beginning  and  also  
mentioned  to  whom  he  was  writing.  That  was  his  style.  So  this  letter  
was obviously not written by Paul. Neither do we know to whom it was 
written. The reason why people titled this letter as ‘Hebrews’ was because 
there are at least 30 references to the Old Testament in it – such as, the 
priesthood  of  Aaron,  Melchizedek,  Joshua  entering  Canaan,  the  taber-
nacle, the sacrifices, the Old Testament heroes of faith, etc. So people 
assumed  that  it  was  written  to  Christians  who  were  familiar  with  the  
Old Testament – namely, the Hebrew (Jewish) Christians. But we are not 
interested in finding out who wrote it or to whom it was written. We shall 
leave such useless research to those pursuing doctorates in theology!! As 
for us, we know that the Holy Spirit wrote it and that it was written for 
us. So we know the real Author and we know whom He wrote it for – us!! 
Jesus – As a Man
This is a very profound letter. I don’t know how many believers read it 
carefully. I think most believers prefer to read Romans and Philippians 
rather than Hebrews. But that could be the work of the devil – who does 
not want believers to be gripped by some amazing truths taught in this 
letter that we do not find in any other book in the Bible. This book reveals 
the humanity of Jesus Christ our Lord and the practical implications of 
that for us more than any other book in the entire New Testament. Every 
truth in Scripture has a practical implication. Because Jesus Christ is 

864 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
God we worship Him and pray to Him. But He is also Man. What prac-
tical implication does that truth have for your life today? If you have not 
found any practical implication for yourself today, from the humanity of 
Christ, then that has become a dead doctrine for you. A dead doctrine 
is like a dead muscle. What happens to a muscle if you don’t use it for 
a long time? It becomes weak and finally withers up. That’s why people 
who have been lying in a hospital-bed for many months have almost to 
learn to walk all over again, when they get out of that bed.
Most Christians have not sought to find a practical application in daily 
life for the truth about Jesus having become a Man. And so they have 
lost that truth for all practical purposes. So much so, that when someone 
emphasises  the  humanity  of  Jesus  Christ  today,  many  believers  will  
consider him to be a heretic. When Martin Luther proclaimed justification 
by faith in the 16
th
 century, many people called him a heretic, because 
they had lost that doctrine for centuries. The same thing happens when-
ever a lost truth in the Bible is recovered. His generation will call him a 
heretic. But the next generation will recognise that he was a prophet.
The same thing happened when Christians began to teach the baptism 
in  the  Holy  Spirit  more  than  100  years  ago.  They  were  called  heretics.  
But  now,  most  Christians  have  accepted  it  as  the  truth  of  God.  It  is  
exactly  the  same  when  it  comes  to  the  humanity  of  Christ.  Very  rarely  
do you hear any preaching today on the humanity of Christ and what its 
implications are for us. 
It is because Jesus lived on earth as a man, that we too can follow in 
His footsteps and “walk as He walked on this earth” (1 John 2:6). If He 
had not been a man like us, we cannot possibly follow Him. The letter 
to the Hebrews presents Jesus the Man.
“Consider  Jesus”  could  be  called  the  theme  of  this  letter  –  for  that  
appears in 3:1; 8:1 and 12:2, 3. 
“Pressing on to perfection” (6:1) could also be considered as a theme of 
this letter.
“Entering into the Most Holy Place” (10:19) could be considered as yet 
another  theme.  This  letter  shows  us  how  we  can  enter  into  a  place  of  
intimate fellowship with God.
The  word  ‘better’  occurs  13  times  in  this  letter  –  a  better sacrifice, a 
better resurrection, a better covenant, a better Mediator, etc. Words like 
‘perfect,’ ‘heavenly,’ ‘eternal’ are also frequently used in this letter. 
Basically what this letter reveals is that if you look at Jesus as a Man 
as your Example, you will find in Him, the secret of an overcoming life. 
We need the power of the Holy Spirit and we need the Word of God. But 
we also need to see Jesus as a Man. 

Jesus – As a Man                                                                                                                                       865
Hebrews
Chapter 1 begins with one of the clearest expressions of the Deity of 
Christ  found  anywhere  in  the  New  Testament.  The  writer  of  Hebrews 
was inspired by the Holy Spirit to write extensively (more than any other 
New  Testament  writer)  about  the  humanity  of  Christ.  So  he  knew  that  
Christians would wonder whether he did not believe in Jesus’ Deity. So 
he was inspired to emphasise that Jesus Christ is God in Chapter 1. 
Most Christians over-emphasise the Deity of Christ to such an extent 
that for all practical purposes they discount His Humanity. And that is 
one reason why Hebrews is not very popular with them. But this is the 
very letter they need to study, if they are to be balanced in their under-
standing of truth. 
I have written a book on the humanity of Christ titled, “Living as Jesus 
Lived”. In its first chapter also, I have begun by emphasising that Jesus 
Christ  is  God.  He  was  God,  even  when  He  walked  on  earth  –  and  that  
was why He readily accepted worship from people – something that even 
angels will not do. 
In Hebrews Chapter1, the writer proves from a number of Old Testament 
verses  that  Jesus  Christ  is  God.  Then  in  Chapter  2,  he  proves  from  a  
number of Old Testament verses that Jesus Christ is Man. These are the 
subjects of the first two chapters.
In Chapter 1, we are told that in the Old Testament, God spoke through 
the prophets in many ways – through visions, dreams, prophetic words 
and  written  Scripture.  But now God has finally spoken to us through 
His Son. His Son is called “The Word of God” – which means God speak-
ing.  Jesus  is  the  Message.  His  life  is  God’s  Message  for  us.  In  the  Old  
Testament,  God  spoke  through  written  words.  Now  He  has  spoken  
through a Living Word – a Person.
The  application  for  us  is  this:  When  we  go  out  into  the  world,  God  
wants to speak to others through you – through your life and not merely 
through your words. Jesus was the Message of God in His time. And you 
and I are the message of God to the world now. That’s why Jesus is called 
“The Word made flesh”. The Word (Message) of God was made flesh first 
in Jesus. Now that Word (Message) has to be seen in our flesh. 
We  are  told  clearly  here  that  the  world  was  made  by  Jesus  the  Son  
(1:2). This is mentioned again in 1:10. The One mentioned in Genesis 1:1 
as the Creator of the world is Jesus the Son of God, along with the Father 
and the Holy Spirit.
Jesus  is  the  radiance  of  God’s  glory  and  the  exact  representation  of  
His nature (1:3). Or in other words, if you want to know what God is like, 
just look at Jesus. “He who has seen Me, has seen the Father”, said Jesus 
(John 14:9). Jesus is also the One who upholds the entire universe by the 
word of His power (1:3). And when Jesus had made a purification of all 
our sins He sat down as a Man at the right hand of the Majesty on high. 
And God commands all the angels to worship Jesus the Man (1:6).

866 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
The word ‘worship’ here once again proves to us that Jesus is no created 
being – for no created being has the right to receive worship. When John 
fell down to worship an angel once, the angel immediately said, “Don’t do 
that. Worship God” (Revelation 19:10). The only Person entitled to receive 
worship  in  this  universe  is  God  Himself.  Anyone  who  receives  worship  
other  than  God  commits  a  terrible  sin.  When  Jesus  was  on  earth,  we  
read in the Gospels, of His receiving and accepting worship from men, at 
least seven times. This proves beyond any doubt, that even though He 
had emptied Himself of the privileges of God when He came to earth, in 
His Person, He was still God – for God can never cease to be God.
Finally,  we  see  God  the  Father  Himself  addressing  Jesus  as  God,  
saying: “Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever” (Hebrews 1:8) – a quota-
tion  from  Psalm  45:6.  All  of  this  introduction  is  to  prove  the  deity  of  
Christ beyond any shadow of doubt. For only after laying this foundation, 
can we proceed to study His Humanity.
Then the writer moves on to show us the humanity of Jesus and all the 
practical implications there are in that truth for us. 
Here is a verse that shows us how Jesus lived on earth as a Man: “You 
have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. Therefore God, Your God 
has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your companions” (1:9). 
When Jesus lived on earth, He lived with all the limitations of us human 
beings. So He needed to be anointed. God the Father doesn’t need to be 
anointed. And Jesus did not need to be anointed when He was in heaven. 
But when He lived on earth, He had to be anointed to be an Example for 
us. Here in this verse we are told why God anointed Jesus with the oil of 
gladness (joy) more than us, His companions. It was primarily because 
of one reason – He loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. He loved 
purity and hated sin.
There  is  a  difference  between  doing  righteousness  and  loving  right-
eousness. A child can obey his father without loving to obey. Jesus did 
not just do righteousness, He loved righteousness.
In the same way, Jesus did not just avoid sin. He hated sin. 
AIDS is one of the deadly diseases that people get through sexual sin 
nowadays. And so, many don’t commit fornication because of the fear of 
getting AIDS. They don’t hate sexual sin; they are just afraid of getting 
AIDS. In the same way many who want to steal don’t do so, because they 
are afraid they might get caught – not because they hate stealing. In the 
same way, you can avoid any other sin without hating it. 
But if you want to be anointed with the oil of gladness, you have to love 
righteousness  and  hate  sin.  It  says  here  that  that  was  the  reason  why  
Jesus was anointed with the oil of gladness more than others. 
There is no partiality with God. A good father will never treat his eldest 
son with greater favour than his other children – there will be no parti-
ality  with  him.  What  he  does  for  his  eldest  son  he  will  do  for  all  his  
children. God the Father is also like that. Jesus is called the First-born of 

Jesus – As a Man                                                                                                                                       867
Hebrews
many brothers. We who are born again are His younger brothers. Jesus 
is the Eldest Son. Since God is not partial, He will do everything for us 
that He did for His Eldest Son, Jesus. Whatever God did for Jesus, He 
will do for me too, if I fulfil the same conditions that Jesus fulfilled. This 
is  one  of  the  great  truths  that  we  discover  through  knowing  about  the  
humanity of Christ.
If it had been written that Jesus was anointed with the oil of gladness 
because He was the Son of God, that would not have encouraged or chal-
lenged us in any way. But when we read that He was anointed because 
He loved righteousness and hated lawlessness, that gives us hope that 
we  can  be  anointed  in  the  same  way  too,  if  we  also  love  righteousness  
and hate sin. So we need to pray, “Lord, work in my heart through the 
Holy Spirit, so that I will not only do righteousness but love it; and that 
I will not only avoid sin but hate it.”
The more we love righteousness and the more we hate sin in our lives, 
the more we will be filled with the joy of the Holy Spirit. The kingdom 
of God which is righteousness and joy in the Holy Spirit will come and 
fill our hearts (Romans  14:17).  Then  we  will  be  enabled  to  obey  the  
command that tells us to “rejoice in the Lord ALWAYS” (Philippians 4:4).
Because  the  One  who  has  spoken  this  Word  is  such  an  important  
Person, therefore we must pay much closer attention to the word, lest we 
drift  from  it  (2:1).  Some  Christians  may  think  that  some  commands  of  
Christ are minor and therefore unimportant. But the important question 
is not how important the commandment is but how important the Person 
is Who gave it. Many Christians are not in danger of rejecting the word 
of God, but of neglecting it – and thereby drifting away from it. I worked 
on ships for many years and I know what drifting is. When a ship has 
stopped  in  a  harbour,  if  an  anchor  is  not  dropped,  it  will  drift.  Even  a  
slow current is enough to push it far away. This slow drift may not be 
observable.  But  by  the  next  morning  the  ship  can  be  far  from  where  
it  stopped  the  previous  night.  Drifting  from  God’s  Word  is  like  that.  If  
your standard of righteousness has become lower, and you have started 
thinking lightly of some sins, and your love for the Lord has cooled off, 
from what these were a year ago, then you can be certain that you have 
drifted – without even realising it.
It is not God’s will that you drift and then come back to Him when you 
hear a powerful message and then drift again and then come back again. 
God wants you to make consistent progress towards total Christlikeness 
in your life. To avoid drifting, you must pay close attention to God’s Word 
(2:1). In 2:3, the writer asks how we can escape if we neglect such a great 
salvation? That verse was not written for unbelievers but for believers. 
Even many Bible-seminaries neglect teaching the Bible itself. Instead, 
they  teach  the  many  theories  that  people  propound  about  the  Bible.  

868 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
God  has  made  provision  for  a  fantastic  salvation  for  us.  But  most  
Christians  have  neglected  it.  That  is  why  they  live  defeated  lives.  They  
have accepted salvation from the penalty of sin (going to hell), but they 
have neglected salvation from the power of sin.
Then the writer goes on to speak about the humanity of Christ. In 2:6, 
he quotes Psalm 8:4 – “What is man that You remember him, or the son 
of man that You care for him? You have made him for a little while lower 
than the angels and have crowned him with glory and honour, and You 
have put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when we look around 
today, all things are not under man’s feet. Man is a slave when he should 
be a king. The devil is ruling the world of men. But we do see the Man 
Jesus in Whom this verse has been fulfilled. All things are under His feet. 
For a little while Jesus was made lower than the angels. But now He is 
crowned with glory and honour – and all things are under His feet today. 
Since Jesus is our Elder Brother, this is the place to which God wants to 
bring all of us too. What God did for His Firstborn Son, He will do for all 
of us. If you are a younger brother/sister of Jesus, then everything that 
God did for Jesus He will do for you too – because there is no partiality 
with God. This is the good news of the gospel.
So this verse in Psalm 8 is referring to Jesus primarily. He was made 
a little lower than the angels – because of the suffering of death. Angels 
don’t  die,  but  Jesus  could  die.  This  made  Him  lower  than  the  angels.  
Adam when created could not have died. So he was not lower than the 
angels. But when he ate the forbidden fruit, then he became lower than 
the  angels,  and  he  could  die.  Today,  Jesus  has  conquered  death  and  
is  above  the  angels  –  and  everything  is  under  His  feet.  When  we  are  
connected to our Lord Jesus Christ, even though at the moment we are 
below the angels and we are going to die, we will one day be above them 
in the resurrection.
Jesus Needed Grace
“Jesus tasted death for everyone by the grace of God” (2:9). Jesus needed 
grace from His Father to go to the cross and die. We know that we need 
grace till the end of our lives if we are to live in victory, be overcomers 
and  do  God’s  will.  But  Did  Jesus  need  it?  He  certainly  did.  In  fact  the  
first person about whom it says in the Bible that “the grace of God was 
upon  Him”  is  Jesus  Christ  (Luke  2:40).  And  the  next  time  in  the  Bible  
that we read that expression is in Acts 4 – about grace being upon the 
disciples of Jesus. When grace is upon someone, he is “under grace”. It 
is when we are “under grace” that we can overcome sin (Romans 6:14). 
Grace came through Jesus Christ (John 1:17). Jesus was the first person 
to live under grace and never sin. So grace cannot mean “the unmerited 
favour of God,” as many people say, because Jesus certainly did not get 
unmerited favour from God. He merited every bit of God’s favour. Grace is 
God’s help and power. Jesus needed that as a Man – and so do we.

Jesus Needed Grace                                                                                                                                 869
Hebrews
The Holy Spirit is showing us here that Jesus needed grace as a Man, 
because although there was no sin in Him, He was weak like us in every 
way. In order to bring us to glory, God perfected Jesus, our Leader and 
Captain through suffering (2:10). We become perfect the same way too – 
through suffering.
What  does  the  word  “perfect”  mean?  We  need  to  understand  this,  
because  this  word  occurs  a  number  of  times  in  Hebrews.  It  does  not  
refer to the perfection that there is in God. All it means is “complete” – like 
an empty glass that is now filled. Then it is complete. It is not as though 
the glass had dirty water at first and now has clean water. No. There was 
no dirty water (sin) in Jesus at any time. He emptied Himself only of the 
privil eges of  God  when  He  came  to  earth  (Philippians  2:5).  Jesus  never  
had to obey anyone when He was in heaven. How then could He experi-
ence what it means to obey an imperfect earthly father and mother, as 
human  beings  have  to?  How  could  He  know  what  it  is  to  perspire  and  
work hard to earn His living? Only by becoming a man like us.
In  order  to  become  the  Captain  and  Leader  of  our  salvation,  Jesus  
became  exactly  like  us.  He  submitted  Himself  to  an  earthly  father  and  
mother, He helped His mother in the kitchen, carried water from the well 
for her, and obeyed everything they commanded Him to do. He perspired 
as  He  worked  as  a  carpenter  and  He  was  tired.  He  went  through  our  
human  experiences  of  suffering,  little  by  little.  Thus  the  vessel  of  His  
experience  as  a  human  being  became  full  and  He  became  “perfect”  as  
a Man. Our life on earth is one of suffering. He accepted suffering and 
walked through the same path we walk. Now the One who sanctifies us 
and those who are sanctified are all from one Father. Jesus sanctifies us 
and we are sanctified, and His Father has become our Father now, and 
He calls us brothers. He is not ashamed to call us His brothers. I am not 
a  son  of  Jesus,  I  am  a  son  of  God  and  a  brother  of  Jesus.  Sometimes  
Christians  are  very  hesitant  to  say  we  are  younger  brothers  of  Jesus.  
But it says very clearly in Romans 8:29 that God predestined that Jesus 
Christ must be the first born among many brothers.
Then  in  2:12, we find a quotation from Psalm  22  –  the  psalm  of  the  
cross (see Psalm 22:1): “I will proclaim Your name to My brethren.” This 
is  a  reference  to  the  younger  brothers  and  sisters  of  Jesus.  And  then  
another verse from Isaiah 8 is quoted: “Behold, I and the children whom 
God has given me.” Then he goes on to say, “Since the children take part 
of flesh and blood He also took part of the same”  (2:14).  That  was  the  
only way He could die – and through death take away the power of death 
from Satan.
Here we are told that Satan had the power of death. Ever since Adam 
sinned,  and  throughout  Old  Testament  times,  Satan  held  the  keys  of  
death.  Adam  had  given  it  to  him.  When  Jesus  died,  He  took  that  key  
away from Satan. Now Jesus says, “I have the keys of death” (Revelation 
1:18). So if you are an obedient child of God, you cannot die until Jesus 

870 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
opens the door. I praise God for that revelation. Nobody and nothing can 
kill  me  –  no  accident,  no  cancer,  no  religious  fundamentalists  –  until  
Jesus opens the door of death for me and says, “My son, come in.” It gives 
us such tremendous confidence to know this truth. Jesus conquered 
death and thereafter the keys of death have been in His hands alone.
Satan  had  the  power  of  death  because  man  had  sinned.  Man  gave  
himself  to  the  devil  in  Eden.  Now  Jesus  wants  to  deliver  us  who  have  
lived all our lives in the fear of death (2:15). All human beings live in the 
fear of death. But you don’t have to live in the fear any more, if you are a 
disciple of Jesus Christ. If you have surrendered everything to Christ and 
have no ambition now but to do God’s will on earth, you need never have 
the fear of death for a single moment. You can sleep peacefully.
We are told here again that Jesus did not become like the angels (2:16). 
The angels also fell into sin – before man. But Jesus did not become an 
angel in order to save them. But when man sinned, God became a man 
in order to save us. I think the reason for this is that Satan sinned on his 
own – whereas Adam sinned through the instigation of Satan. Jesus was 
made like us, His brethren, in everything (2:17). The humanity of Christ 
was exactly like ours, except for our sin. He did not have sinful flesh 
and He never sinned. But otherwise His humanity was exactly the same 
as yours and mine. That is how He could become a merciful High Priest 
for  us.  Only  thus  could  He  satisfy  the  righteous  requirement  of  God’s  
Law and make an atonement for our sins. And as a Man, since He was 
tempted in every point, and suffered in His flesh in those temptations, He 
can now come running to our aid, when we are tempted (2:18). He could 
not have understood the power of temptation practically, if He had not 
been tempted exactly like we are.
Consider  an  illustration:  If  an  angel  from  heaven  came  to  teach  you  
how to swim and took you to a river and flew across the river and said, 
“Follow me”, what would you tell him? You would say, “I can’t follow you. 
I can only admire you. If you want me to follow you, first get rid of your 
wings, take a body like mine that is pulled down by gravity and then tell 
me to follow you. ” In the same way, if Jesus had come to earth and used 
all His powers as God, and lived in perfect purity and said, “Follow Me,” 
we could tell Him, “We can’t follow you. You are God – and God cannot be 
tempted. But we are not God. We are tempted all the time, pulled down 
by the law of sin.” To be an example for us, Jesus would have to feel the 
pull of temptation exactly like we do, and have no resources other than 
what  we  have.  Only  thus  could  He  be  an  example  for  us.  And  that  is  
what Jesus did. He came just like you and me, felt the pull of temptation, 
sought  the  power  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  sought  for  grace  to  overcome  that  
pull and lived in perfect purity. He asks us now to overcome temptation, 
exactly as He overcame (Revelation 3:21). 
I remember when my eyes were opened to this truth. I wept and said, 
“Lord, I never realised that You came right down to my low level. I thought 

The Evil of Unbelief                                                                                                                                  871
Hebrews
You came to a level, slightly above mine. But now that I realise that You 
loved me so much that You became like me and were tempted like me in 
order to be my Example, I want to follow You all the days of my life.” This 
revelation  changed  the  direction  of  my  life.  But  the  more  I  proclaimed  
it,  the  more  I  found  that  Christians  opposed  what  I  taught.  The  devil  
hates  this  doctrine  because  he  knows  it  will  lead  people  to  victory.  He  
knows that this is the secret of godliness – and he doesn’t want you to be 
godly. This truth changed my life, my family life, my ministry, the lives 
of people whom I ministered to, and the family lives of the people whom 
I  ministered  to.  The  Bible  became  a  new  book  to  me.  I  saw  wonderful  
things in Scripture which I had never seen before, when the Holy Spirit 
filled me and showed me that Jesus was made like us in everything, 
and was tempted like us, and suffered like us. What an example Jesus 
became! Under the old covenant they never had any example. They only 
had commandments. But we now have an Example. Praise the Lord!
In 3:1, the writer invites “holy brethren” who have a “heavenly calling” 
to  “consider  Jesus.”  That  is  really  the  message  of  this  book:  Consider 
Jesus.  I  wish  I  could  proclaim  to  every  Christian  in  the  world,  “Holy  
brethren,  you  have  a  heavenly  calling.  Do  you  want  to  live  according  
to that heavenly calling? Do you want to be a holy brother/holy sister? 
Then consider Jesus Who became like you (2:17), and Who was faithful 
to God Who appointed Him. Jesus is greater than Moses because Moses 
was only a part of the house whereas Jesus is the Builder of the house.
The Evil of Unbelief
In 3:7,  we  are  warned,  “Today  if  you  hear  His  voice  don’t  harden  your  
heart.” And then in 3:12, “Take care lest there should be in any one of you 
an evil, unbelieving heart.” The writer is warning holy brethren who have 
partaken of the heavenly calling to fear ending up with an evil, unbeliev-
ing heart that cannot believe that Jesus came exactly like them.
It is only when you are fed up with your defeated life that God will give 
you this revelation that Jesus came like you in order to be your Example. 
I  was  a  thoroughly  defeated  Christian  at  one  time.  But  I  was  sick  and  
tired of my defeated life. I used to cry out to God day and night, saying, 
“Lord, I don’t know what the answer is. I am a preacher but I am defeated 
by sin in my inner life. I am defeated in my thoughts, in my words and in 
my family life. I am born again, and water-baptised. But I am defeated. 
Show me what I need to know.” Then the Lord showed me the secret of 
godliness  –  Christ came in the flesh and was tempted exactly like me, 
and yet lived a pure life. I believed it wholeheartedly – and it changed my 
life. We are warned here that if we have an unbelieving heart, we can fall 
away from God (3:12).
But  instead  of  falling  away,  the  next  verse  gives  us  another  option,  
“Encourage  one  another,  exhort  one  another  every  day,  as  long  as  it  is  

872 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
called today” (3:13). We do not know what will happen tomorrow. So let 
us do something today. Let us encourage someone today. Let us exhort 
someone today. In the context of this chapter, that means to encourage 
someone to consider Jesus Who became like us. Our calling, every day, 
is to lift up Jesus. Our conduct and our words must always be saying, 
“Look at Jesus. What a wonderful Saviour He is! He not only forgave my 
sins, but He changed my life. He has changed my family life, He has filled 
me  with  the  joy  of  the  Lord  so  that  I  can  rejoice  always.  He  has  taken  
away the fear of death from me. Consider Jesus.” Our life must be a chal-
lenge  and  an  encouragement  to  others  every  day.  When  people  look  at  
your face, they must see something of the glory of God there.
3:13  warns  us  that  it  takes  only  24  hours  to  become  a  backslider.  
That’s  why  we  need  to  exhort  and  encourage  one  another  every  day. 
We have a responsibility for each other in the Body of Christ. Cain said, 
“I am not my brother’s keeper.” But in Christ’s Body, we are our broth-
er’s  keepers,  we  are  our  sister’s  keepers.  If  you  see  somebody  slipping  
up, encourage him. If you see somebody falling, lift him up. If you have 
nobody to encourage you or exhort you, you have the Holy Spirit and the 
Bible. The apostle Paul has exhorted and encouraged me personally on 
many days – through his words in the Bible. Peter, James and John have 
also exhorted and encouraged me. Many times when I didn’t have broth-
ers near me to exhort me, these apostles came to me through the pages 
of the Bible and encouraged me. Isn’t it wonderful that we all can have 
Peter, Paul and John with us in our rooms, to encourage us every day? 
Why don’t you let them encourage you? Why do you keep them locked 
away inside the Book?
You need to read the Bible itself, more than all the other books that 
speak about  the  Bible.  I  don’t  want  to  know  what  all  the  great  Bible-
scholars have to say about Peter’s, Paul’s and John’s writings say. I want 
to  hear  them  directly.  So  I  read  the  Bible  itself  –  and  not  books  about  
the Bible.
3:14 tells us that “we have become partakers of Christ IF....” There is 
a big IF there. We are told there that we become partakers of Christ only 
“if   we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm until the end”.  Not  
otherwise. We have to endure until the end. A lot of people start a mara-
thon race well, but they don’t finish the race at all. They drop out along 
the way. It is the same with many Christians. And there is no prize in any 
race for starting well.
Look  at  the  example  of  the  Israelites  who  started  well  but  did  not  
finish their race. Three times in the New Testament, we are told to take 
a warning from the Israelites who left Egypt but never entered Canaan. 
Here  in  Hebrews  3  and  also  in  1  Corinthians10  and  in  Jude  1. They 
started wonderfully, banging timbrels and praising God (Exodus 15). But 
two years later, God began to be angry with them; and He continued to 
be angry with them for the next 38 years.

The Evil of Unbelief                                                                                                                                  873
Hebrews
Their problem was an evil unbelieving heart. God had promised them 
while in Egypt that He would take them into Canaan’s land. But they did 
not believe that God was capable of doing that. Yet God gave them food 
from heaven during all those 40 years. He gave them water from a rock 
and did many miracles for them. When God does a miracle for you, that 
is no proof that He is happy with you. It just proves that He is a good 
God. He could still be angry with you for allowing the giants of sin to rule 
in your life. When will He be happy with you? When you enter “the land 
of Canaan” and put those giants of sin under your feet. These Israelites 
could  honestly  testify  that  they  had  experienced  some  of  the  greatest  
miracles ever experienced by men on earth – two million people getting 
bread from heaven every day for 40 years, rivers of water flowing from a 
dry rock, and miraculously instantaneous healing from snakebites. Yet 
God was angry with them for 38 years. The same is true today too. God 
is angry with many people for whom he does amazing miracles, because 
they tolerate sin in their lives. Have you put anger, jealousy, bitterness, 
lustful looks and the love of money, under your feet? If not, then your 
experiencing miracles proves nothing. 
In 3:19,  we  read  “They  were  not  able  to  enter  because  of  unbelief.” 
And  then  we  are  told  in  4:1,  to  “fear  lest,  when  God  has  given  us  also  
a  promise  of  entering  into  His  rest  we  come  short  of  it.”  What  does  that  
mean? God  has  promised  us  that  if  we  come  under  His  grace, “NO  sin  
can have dominion over us” (Romans 6:14). That is as clear a promise as 
God gave the Israelites that He would bring every giant in Canaan under 
their feet. This is the life of rest that God promises. The opposite of rest 
is  turmoil,  defeat,  up-and-down  experiences,  etc.,  You  should  fear  lest  
you don’t enter into this rest, because we also have had the gospel (good 
news) preached to us just like they heard it (4:2).
What  was  the  good  news  they  heard?  There  were  two  parts  to  the  
promise  that  God  gave  them  when  they  were  still  in  Egypt,  “I  will  take  
you out of Egypt” and “I will bring you into Canaan” (Exodus 3:17). They 
heard that good news, but they experienced only the first part. We too 
can hear about the two parts of our salvation – Jesus can forgive our sins 
and Jesus can keep us from falling into sin – and yet experience only the 
first part. We are told here to fear lest we miss out on entering into this 
life of victory. Yet I find very few believers who have this fear. They are 
casual  about  their  defeated  life.  The  Israelites  were  given  this  fantas-
tic  promise  of  defeating  the  giants  and  possessing  Canaan.  But  they  
remained  occupied  with  seeing  miracles,  hearing  voices  from  heaven,  
experiencing healing from snake-bites, etc. But they never entered into 
the land God had promised them. You too can be occupied (and excited) 
with healings and miracles and voices from heaven, and miss out on the 
main message of the gospel – overcoming sin. Why couldn’t the Israelites 
enter the land? Because they did not stand together in faith with Joshua 
and Caleb who heard and believed. It is by faith in God’s promise that we 

874 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
can enter into this life of rest. God’s will is that we should enter into this 
life of constant rest.
The  writer  then  uses  the  example  of  the  Sabbath  as  another  old-  
covenant  picture  of  rest  (4:4).  When  Adam  and  Eve  were  created,  their 
very first day was a day of rest, because they were created at the end of 
the sixth day. God rested on the seventh day in order to teach Adam and 
Eve the necessity of beginning all their labour from a position of rest in 
Him always. To the disobedient Israelites, God said that they would not 
enter into His rest. But to us, God says that we can enter in. He says, 
“Today, if you hear His voice don’t harden your heart” (4:7). The time in 
the gospel-message is always ‘Today’ – not tomorrow or yesterday. God is 
calling you to a much higher life than you have experienced thus far. So 
don’t harden your hearts. Say, “Lord, I want to enter into this life of rest.”
The land of Canaan is only a picture of the life of victory that God offers 
us.  There  remains  a  Sabbath  rest  for  you  today.  God  is  promising  you  
a constant Sabbath – a life of perpetual rest in Him. We can enter this 
rest when we recognise that our own striving will not help us to enter. 
We  must  allow  God  to  bring  us  in.  We  must  rest  from  our  own  works,  
just like God rested from His work (4:10). God worked for six days and 
then stopped working on the seventh day. The writer is using that as a 
picture of how we also should stop struggling, if we are to enter into this 
rest. As long as you imagine that by your own efforts you can overcome 
sin one day, you will be defeated. Consider the example of the disciples 
trying to catch fish (in John  21).  They  were  struggling  all  across  that  
lake the whole night – but caught nothing. When they stopped struggling 
and trusted in the word of the Lord, their boat was filled with fish. The 
lesson there is the same. When you come to the Lord and say, “Lord, a 
lifetime of struggle will not give me victory. You have to give it to me by 
Your grace”, then you will enter into this life. The period of struggling is a 
picture of living under the law, where man tries to do something for God. 
Under grace, God does something for us. When you cease from your own 
struggling, you will enter into this rest. That is the secret.
In 4:11, we read, “Therefore let us be diligent to enter into this rest by 
faith and not fall like those people in the wilderness in disobedience.” Let 
us cry out to God and say, “Lord, bring me into this life of rest. This is 
something I have never experienced in the Christian life. I want it.” Jesus 
said, “Come to Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give 
you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, and you shall find 
rest for your souls” (Matthew 11:28, 29). First we enter into the rest of the 
forgiveness of our sins, and then we can enter the rest of victory over sin.
The Piercing Word of God
In 4:12, we read. “The word of God is living and active and sharper than 
any two-edged sword, piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, 

The Piercing Word of God                                                                                                                       875

of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions 
of the heart.” God’s Word penetrates like a sword into our hearts and 
reveals  to  us  our  thoughts  and  our  intentions.  In  the  new  covenant  
(which Hebrews emphasises), it is “the thoughts and intentions of the 
heart” that are of utmost importance, whereas under the old covenant 
evil  thoughts  and  intentions  were  not  considered  serious,  because  
the  Israelites  did  not  have  the  Holy  Spirit  dwelling  within  them.  The  
Law  could  not  expose  or  punish  man  for  having  evil  thoughts  and  
intentions.  As  long  as  man  did  everything  externally,  the  Law  would  
commend him. But not so, in the new covenant. When man was under 
the Law, the Word of God only tested him on the outside, like a doctor 
examining a patient superficially. But in the new covenant the Word of 
God penetrates inside the heart, like a scan or an X-ray. God is now 
more  interested  in  our  thoughts,  attitudes,  motives  and    intentions.  
At  times,  when  everything  looks  good  on  the  outside,  there  could  be  
great evil inside, just like a lot of people who look healthy on the outside 
can have serious diseases like cancer on the inside.
So if you read God’s word today and you are convicted only of external 
sins in your life, that would indicate that you did not hear all that God 
wanted  to  say  to  you.  So  always  test  yourself  with  this  question:  “Did  
God’s Word reveal the thoughts and intentions of my heart to me?” Notice 
that the emphasis here is on the heart and not the head. In all anointed 
preaching of God’s Word, the Word will go through your mind and enter 
your heart and reveal to you your innermost thoughts and intentions.
In 1 Corinthians 14:25, we read of the result that comes from anointed 
preaching.  The  thoughts  of  people’s  hearts  are  revealed  and  they  bow  
down  and  acknowledge  that  God  is  present  in  the  meeting.  The  same  
thing can happen when you are in conversation with a godly man and he 
speaks  an  anointed,  prophetic  word  to  you.  The  anointed  word  always  
reveals the thoughts and intentions of the heart because God’s Word is 
like a sharp two-edged sword. If you want to serve the Lord, make sure 
that  the  blade  is  sharp  in  your  heart  and  mouth.  Don’t  ever  blunt  the  
edge of the sword and soften the word of God with polished words, in a 
diplomatic way, to make it more acceptable to man. That won’t do people 
any good, because it won’t penetrate and go where it should. Have you 
tried cutting meat with a blunt knife? You can go on cutting and the meat 
will still not be cut. A preacher who compromises the sharpness of God’s 
word will find at the end of his message that no-one heard God.
God’s Word is a two edged sword. The preacher must first allow it to 
cut  open  his  own  heart  and  reveal  his  own  thoughts  and  intentions!  
Only  then  will  he  be  able  to  use  it  to  cut  open  other  people’s  hearts.  
If  the Word of God hasn’t penetrated your own heart first, don’t preach 
it.  Most  preachers  never  judge  themselves  with  God’s  Word.  They  only  
judge others.

876 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
The  Word  of  God  penetrates  and  judges  our  motives  too.  If  we  open  
ourselves  to  the  voice  of  the  Spirit  in  God’s  Word  constantly,  we  will  
ultimately have a totally clean heart, because the thoughts and motives 
of  our  heart  will  be  revealed  to  us  constantly  and  we  will  be  able  to  
cleanse ourselves. Every believer should live like this every day. Just as 
the  Israelites  in  the  wilderness  received  the  manna  daily,  we  too  must  
receive God’s anointed Word every day from Him.
Soulish or Spiritual?
Another  thing  that  the  word  of  God  does  is  divide  between  soul  and  
spirit (4:12). This goes a little deeper than what we have just considered. 
For example, if we preach with a bad motive (to get honour or to make 
money), we will know that immediately. But the division of soul and spirit 
will reveal whether we are depending on our soul (mind and emotions) to 
get God’s Word across to people, or upon the Holy Spirit. People under 
the old covenant could not distinguish between soul and spirit.
The old covenant tabernacle had three parts – outer court, holy place 
and most holy place. This was a picture of man’s body, soul and spirit 
(1 Thessalonians 5:23). The soul was represented by the Holy Place and 
the spirit by the Most Holy Place. God’s presence was in the Most Holy 
Place. There was a thick veil between the holy Place and the Most Holy 
Place. No man was allowed to enter the Most Holy Place (except the high-
priest once a year). This was to symbolically teach that man could not 
live or serve God “in the spirit” under the old covenant. So the Israelites 
were  not  able  to  distinguish  between  what  was  soulish  and  what  was  
spiritual. Those who still cannot distinguish the difference between these 
two are living as old covenant Christians.
The word of God will show you what is soulish and what is spiritual. 
A  lot  of  so-called  “Christian”  work  today  is  soulish.  Soulish  work  is  
based  on  human  ideas  of  serving  God.  They  may  be  good  ideas  that  
are not evil or carnal. But they are human and soulish. There are three 
types  of  Christians.  Carnal  Christians  are  those  who  are  born  again  
but who still enjoy “limited” amounts of sinful pleasure and who love 
money, etc. Then there are soulish Christians who have given up all of 
that, but who still live in their intellect and their emotions. Then there 
are spiritual Christians who seek to be led by the Holy Spirit in all that 
they do.
Soulish Christians may be good people who are eager to witness and 
serve  the  Lord.  But  their  way  of  doing  all  of  this  is  very  human.  They  
don’t  understand  God’s  ways.  God  says,  “My  ways  are  not  your  ways.  
As the heaven is higher than the earth, so My ways are above your ways” 
(Isaiah  55:8,  9).  There  are  human  methods  by  which  we  can  try  and  

Soulish or Spiritual?                                                                                                                                  877

reach lost souls, and human methods of serving God. David once trans-
ported  the  ark  of  God  on  a  bullock  cart  –  the  way  the  Philistines  once  
did it (2 Samuel 6:3; 1 Samuel 6:11). That was a good idea – to save the 
Kohathites from the burden of carrying it on their shoulders for that long 
journey. But that was not God’s way – and that was why God brought 
judgement on the way.
Whenever Christians adopt a human way of doing God’s work, there 
will be confusion. There may be external results that are impressive. But 
the glory of God will be absent. Moses made the tabernacle exactly like 
God told him. He did not build it, as he had studied in the academies in 
Egypt, where they learnt how to build the massive pyramids. Moses had 
to give up his human understanding of how to build God’s house. That 
was one reason why God had to take him into the wilderness for 40 years 
– to get rid of his human wisdom. That was why God took Paul to Arabia 
for  3  years  to  get  rid  of  the  human  ideas  he  had  got  from  Gamaliel’s  
Bible-school  during  the  3  years  he  studied  there  (Galatians  1:17,  18). 
He had to pour out his soulish understanding to death before He could 
understand God’s ways.
Soul  also  refers  to  human  power  –  where  we  depend  on  human  
resources. We can imagine that we can do God’s work better if we have 
many  electronic  gadgets  and  we  have  political  influence.  That  is  a 
deception. It is the power of the Holy Spirit by which God’s work can be 
accomplished. The early apostles did not have money, gadgets, or influ-
ence.  Their  human  resources  were  about  zero.  But  they  accomplished  
much  more  than  Christians  today  accomplish  with  all  their  gadgets,  
money and influence. The apostles had spiritual power – not soul power. 
We  must  divide  between  soul  and  spirit  if  we  are  to  become  truly  
spiritual. I have been to many meetings where they claim that the Holy 
Spirit  is  moving  just  because  there  is  a  lot  of  emotion  and  noise.  But  
I  am  not  fooled.  I  can  see  clearly  that  it  is  merely  the  working  up  of  
the human soul, and not the working of the Holy Spirit. What they call 
“the baptism in the Holy Spirit” is only a “baptism of their soul-power”. 
Jesus  does  genuinely  baptise  Christians  in  the  Holy  Spirit  even  today.  
But that brings spiritual power to be a witness for Christ (Acts 1:5, 8). 
Soul-power however only stirs up one’s emotions. But most Christians 
have no discernment on this matter and so they are deceived.
They  speak  in  “tongues”  in  some  non-Christian  prayer  meetings  as  
well,  and  whip  up  their  emotions  and  claim  to  “come  to  an  inner  rest”! 
Many religions indulge in the whipping up of human soul-power.
If  we  don’t  discern  between  soul  and  spirit  in  these  days,  we  will  be  
thoroughly  deceived.  A  lot  of  “healing”  that  is  being  done  in  Jesus’  
Name  today  is  also  through  the  power  of  the  human  soul  and  not  
through a genuine gift of the Holy Spirit. An “atmosphere” is built up 
in the meeting with a lot of singing. People’s emotions are whipped up, 

878 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
by  singing  songs  like  “Lord,  I  believe,”  numerous  times.  Then  people  
are  asked  to  “release  their  faith”!!  This  has  nothing  to  do  with  God.  
The  preacher  is  just  hypnotising  the  people.  Jesus  and  the  apostles  
never healed people like that. They healed the sick quietly, without any 
singing or emotion. 
If  you  don’t  recognise  this  counterfeit,  you  may  even  try  to  copy  it,  
imagining that this is the way to serve God. And then you may go and 
manifest your soul power in similar ways to others and deceive them and 
yourself. So allow the word of God to penetrate within you and to show 
you what is soulish and what is spiritual. If you look at Jesus, you will 
find the answer in Him. If you ever attend a healing meeting or watch 
it on Christian TV, just ask yourself if this is how Jesus did it. You will 
discover the truth straightaway. But if you neglect the word of God, then 
you will certainly be deceived. Let the word of God divide between soul 
and spirit. God has given us His word and the example of Jesus and of 
the apostles to show us what true spirituality really is.
“There is no creature hidden from Him and everything is open and naked 
to Him with whom we have to do” (4:13). This is a lovely phrase: “Him with 
whom we have to do.” It means that as human beings, there is only one 
Person in the universe with whom we have to do, only one Person we are 
answerable  to  –  God  Himself.  If  you  live  your  life  recognising  that  you  
will become more and more godly. But if you are always thinking about 
the  opinion  that  others  have  of  you,  then  you  will  become  their  slave.  
If   you want to be a servant of God, then recognise always that “it is only 
God with Whom you have to do”. Ten thousand people calling you a godly 
person  will  not  make  you  a  godly  person.  In  the  same  way,  ten  thou-
sand people calling you an ungodly person will not make you ungodly. 
Certificates from men are worthless. So throw them all in the garbage 
bin. Other people know very little about your private life, your thoughts 
and  your  money-dealings,  etc.  They  know  only  about  1%  of  your  life  –  
and their opinion is based only on that 1% knowledge. So their opinions 
are  worthless  –  whether  good  or  bad.  Both  good  and  bad  opinions  are  
equally fit for the garbage bin. Throw them there. That’s what I myself 
have done for many years. Thus I have been freed to serve God.
If you want to be freed to serve God say, “Lord, You are the One with 
whom  I  have  to  do.  Every  day  I  want  to  stand  before  You.  There  is  
nothing hidden from Your eyes. Everything in my life is open and laid 
bare before You. I can fool people that I am spiritual, but I cannot fool 
You.” If you live like that you will see a change coming in your life for 
the better. Thus you will begin to enter the new-covenant life.
In 4:14–16, we read about Jesus having passed through the heavens. 
The Bible tells us that there are three heavens. The first heaven is space,

part of which we can see – the sun, moon and stars, etc. (Psalm 8:3). The 
third  heaven  is  where  paradise  now  is,  and  Paul  was  taken  there  once  
(2  Corinthians  12:2–4).  In  between  these  two  is  the  second  heaven  (or  
heavenlies), where Satan has his headquarters. When Satan was thrown 
out  of  heaven  (Isaiah  14:12),  he  was  not  thrown  down  to  hell,  but  to  
the second heaven. From there he can speak to God (as we see in Job 
1 and 2) as well as move around on earth. But he cannot ever enter the 
third heaven again. When we die we go to the third heaven. When Jesus 
ascended after His resurrection, He passed through the two heavens into 
the third heaven, where the Father dwells (Hebrews 4:14).
In 4:15,  we  are  told  that  Jesus,  as  our  High  Priest  can  sympathise  
with  our  weaknesses.  God  as  our  all-knowing  Creator  could  certainly  
have sympathised with our struggles, even without becoming a Man. But 
Jesus’ sympathy with us now comes through His having actually expe-
rienced the struggles we face as human beings. We can all sympathise 
with someone who is going through some difficulty. But we can sympa-
thise with him far better if we have gone through that same difficulty 
ourselves. For example, if a mother has lost her only son, someone who 
has also lost an only son will be able to sympathise with her far more than 
others can. That was why God became Man – so that He could enter into 
everything that we go through and thus sympathise with us and come 
into a true fellowship with us. Since Jesus is our Bridegroom, He wanted 
to go through everything that we, His Bride go through as well. Thus He 
can also be an Example to us and meaningfully say, “Follow Me.”
If my wife is walking through a very difficult pathway, I would not want 
to sit on the outside and just exhort her to be faithful. I would also want 
to go along with her through that path and help her to be faithful. Jesus 
is our Bridegroom and He is like that. Are you going through some diffi-
culty,  discouragement,  trial,  pressure  or  temptation?  Jesus  has  faced  
the  pressures  you  face  and  can  well  understand  your  plight.  He  may  
not have faced the exact situation that you face. But He has faced every 
temptation that comes to you in your situation. And He will also help you 
through His Spirit to be an overcomer as He Himself overcame (Revelation 
3:21). I will never allow my wife to lift a heavy weight all by herself. I will 
help her to lift it. Jesus does the same for us.
Life’s Biggest Problem
What is the biggest problem that we face? Some may imagine that their 
financial  difficulties  are  their  biggest  problem. But  what  many  call  
“financial difficulties”  is  just  the  result  of  covetousness.  They  compare  
themselves with others who are better off than them and feel envious. If 
however they had compared themselves with those who have less than 
them, they would have been perfectly content and thankful – and their 
“financial difficulties” would have disappeared! I remember reading of a 

880 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
missionary who, at one time, did not have money even to buy toothpaste. 
But he discovered in those days that he could brush his teeth without 
toothpaste! We are used to a certain standard of living, and when we can’t 
live at that standard, we imagine that we are poor. A man who is seeking 
after godliness will never be concerned that he cannot afford toothpaste – 
or even a toothbrush! Most people in India in any case, brush their teeth 
with only their fingers and a little salt or coal-powder. 
The biggest problem that a person seeking after godliness is concerned 
about is overcoming the temptation to sin.
In 4:15, we read that Jesus “was tempted in all points exactly as we 
are.” That is why He can sympathise with us. He felt the pull of every 
temptation, in exactly the same way as we feel it. Otherwise it would 
not be written here that He was tempted “as we are, in every point”. 
When Satan tempted Him He felt the pull of temptation, but He said, 
“No.” If He didn’t feel that pull, it would not have been a temptation. 
Temptation  is  like  a  tug-of-war.  Two  teams  hold  the  rope  and  pull  
against each other. When you are trying to hold on to a holy life, you feel 
a pull in the other direction. That is temptation. If nobody is pulling the 
rope on the other side, there is no tug-of-war. If Jesus did not feel any 
pull, then we will have to say that He was not tempted like us. Then we 
will have to say the Bible is telling lies when it says in Matthew 4:1–10 
that the devil tempted Him and when it says in Hebrews 4:15, that He 
was tempted in all points just as we are.
The word “temptation” in the Bible always refers to the temptation to 
commit  sin.  Normal  desires  like  the  desire  to  sleep  when  we  are  tired,  
are not temptation. That is not the meaning here when it says that Jesus 
was  tempted  like  us.  He  was  tempted  like  we  are,  to  sin  –  and  He  did  
not sin. Is He an Example in that area for us? He certainly is. We saw in 
Hebrews 2:17 that He was made like us in all things. He was not like an 
angel with wings trying to teach us to swim. No. He came to earth without 
His “wings” so that He could teach us to swim. When Jesus walked on 
the water, He overcame the law of gravity. If an angel had skimmed over 
the  water,  that  would  not  have  been  a  miracle.  But  this  was  a  miracle  
because Jesus overcame gravity. When He told Peter that he could also 
walk on the water, He was actually telling him that he could do the same 
as Jesus did, if he trusted Him. Our Father in heaven is not partial to 
His eldest Son, Jesus. What He did for Jesus, He will do for us too, if we 
trust Him.
Jesus was tempted in all points as we are but He did not sin. And in 
this He is our Example. Whenever we are tempted we can tell the Lord, 
“Lord, at some time in Your earthly life in Nazareth You too were tempted 
as I am being tempted now. Help me to react exactly as You did then.” 
Are  you  being  tempted  to  be  discouraged  or  to  react  in  sinful  anger?  

Life’s Biggest Problem                                                                                                                              881
Hebrews
Jesus too was tempted in those areas. But He did not sin. So you can 
look at His example and say, “Lord, I want to follow You.” He lived like 
that through the power of the Holy Spirit. So we too must seek for the 
power of the Holy Spirit if we are to live like Him. And that is why it says 
in 4:16,  “Therefore let us (also) go to the throne of grace...”.  The  word  
“Therefore...” refers to the previous verse about Jesus being tempted like 
us and not sinning. Therefore, we can also go to the throne of grace as 
He went in His earthly days and receive the same grace that can enable 
us also to overcome sin.
4:16 speaks of mercy and grace. There is a difference between mercy 
and grace. Mercy deals with our past, whereas grace is for the future. 
We need mercy for the sins we have committed. Then we need grace to 
help us overcome sin in the future. They had only mercy under the old 
covenant. Grace came through Jesus Christ in the new covenant (John 
1:17). Jesus did not need mercy because He never sinned. But we need 
both mercy and grace.
What is “the time of need” spoken of in 4:16? It is when you are tempted. 
Suppose you were climbing a mountain and you slipped and were hanging 
on a cliff by your fingers. You can’t hold on and you fall and break your 
bones. Then you cry for help. Then the ambulance comes and picks you 
up, takes you to the hospital, fixes your bones. That is mercy. But if you 
cry for help before you fall, and someone pulls you up and makes you 
stand on the rock, that is grace. Your real time of need is before you fall. 
To cry for help after falling is the second best. The best is to ask for help 
before you fall. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of grace and He is called the 
Helper. He can help you when you are slipping (tempted), before you fall.
Most Christians keep on falling and keep on asking for mercy. They fall 
and then ask God to forgive them. They start climbing again, fall again 
and ask for the ambulance of mercy once again. Mercifully, the ambu-
lance does come each time. But that is not the way God wants you to live. 
The  next  time  you  are  tempted,  when  you  are  tempted  to  be  angry,  or  
to think sexually dirty thoughts, and you find yourself slipping, cry out, 
“Lord, give me grace now.” You will be surprised to find that you do not 
fall. God’s grace will hold you up. Romans 6:14 says, “Sin shall not rule 
over you because you are under grace.”
In 5:1,  he  speaks  about  Jesus  as  our  High  Priest.  No  one  in  Israel  
could  decide  to  be  a  high  priest  unless  God  called  him,  as  He  called  
Aaron (5:4). In the same way, we are told that even Jesus did not make 
Himself our High Priest. He waited 4000 years in heaven and when the 
time came that the Father had appointed, He was told to go to earth and 
He went (Galatians 4:4). 
Wasn’t there a need on earth for those 4000 years? If we were in God’s 
place, we would have sent Jesus the very next day after Adam sinned. 

882 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
But God’s ways are not our ways. Whenever we see a need, we act imme-
diately. But God could wait 4000 years. Even after Jesus came to earth, 
He waited for 30 years before He went out into the ministry. Jesus was 
never  moved  by  the  need  alone.  He  saw  the  need  and  was  concerned  
about it. But when the Father said, “Go,” He went. And then in 3½ years 
He completed the ministry the Father had appointed for Him. He didn’t 
just run around here and there trying to meet various needs. At the end 
of His life, Jesus could say, “I have finished the work My Father gave me 
to do” (John 17:4). Most Christians will not be able to say that at the end 
of  their  lives,  because  they  acted  on  the  basis  of  need  and  not  on  the  
basis of God’s call.
One  of  the  things  I  learned  very  early  in  my  Christian  life  was  this:  
“Observe the needs carefully, but go only where God tells you to go and 
when He tells you to go”. We must lift up our eyes and look at the harvest. 
But what we are to do is the will of God (See John 4:35 and 34). Even 
Jesus waited until He was sent.
Jesus Learnt Obedience
In 5:7,  we  are  told  of  how  Jesus  prayed  “in the days of His flesh.”  He  
“prayed with loud crying and tears to be saved from death”. This is not 
referring to the last day of His life when He prayed in Gethsemane only. 
God’s Word is exact when it says that He prayed like that “in the days of 
His flesh”. “Days” refers to His entire 33½ years on earth. The death that 
Jesus  prayed  to  be  saved  from  (and  from  which  He  was  saved,  as  this  
verse says) was certainly not physical death, but spiritual death (which 
results from committing even one sin). Jesus prayed that He might never 
sin even once. And He was so earnest about that, that His prayers for 
help were with loud crying and tears. That is why He never sinned. Many 
imagine that Jesus overcame sin because He was the Son of God. No. He 
overcame sin because He prayed with loud crying and tears to be saved 
from  sin.  He  loved  righteousness  and  hated  sin  so  earnestly  that  He  
prayed so fervently – and His Father anointed Him with power, more than 
other believers who don’t pray as earnestly as He did (Hebrews 1:9). Most 
believers take sin casually and assume that they can never overcome sin, 
because they are human. But that is not the reason. The reason is that 
they don’t pray with loud crying and tears to be saved from sin.
It was to pray with loud crying and tears that Jesus often sought out 
lonely places for prayer (Luke 5:16). When we live in the city, it is difficult 
to find a lonely place. But I have discovered that I can pray with loud 
crying in my heart to God, without making any sound with my mouth, 
wherever I may be. I can cry out for purity in thought, word and deed. 
And if I fall into some sin, I want to have tears. Jesus never fell and yet He 
had tears. That really humbles me. Zeal for purity consumed Jesus and 
burned Him up. That’s why He accomplished all the will of God on earth.

Jesus Learnt Obedience                                                                                                                           883
Hebrews
The fullness of the Holy Spirit brings a zeal for purity within us. Then 
we can follow Jesus’ example. Jesus was never afraid of physical death. 
But He feared spiritual death and so He never wanted even the smell of 
sin in Him at any time. What was He praying for in Gethsemane, when 
He said that He didn’t want to drink the cup? The cup He feared was the 
break of fellowship with His Father for 3 hours on the cross – when He 
would bear our sin. That is spiritual death. And Jesus hated sin, because 
it would break His fellowship with His Father. 
But in Gethsemane, the Father told Him that He would have to accept 
that break in fellowship, if He was to save others from eternal separation 
from God in hell. And in His immense love for us, Jesus agreed to pay 
that heavy price. But all through His life He had resisted any break of 
fellowship with the Father – that would come through sin. The slightest 
smell  of  sin  breaks  fellowship  with  God  immediately.  If  we  value  that  
fellowship, we will also pray with loud crying and tears that there should 
not be the slightest smell in us of bitterness, or spiritual pride, or impu-
rity,  or  jealousy,  or  love  of  money,  or  hatred,  or  anything  outside  the  
perfect will of God.
It is because we don’t have such a passion to live in God’s perfect will, 
that  we  take  sin  so  lightly.  Holiness  is  not  the  major  passion  of  most  
Christians. Their passion is usually some type of service for the Lord or 
for people in need. But that can be a worldly concept. Mary sought fellow-
ship with Jesus while Martha sought to serve Him. And Jesus rebuked 
Martha saying that what Mary chose was the only thing necessary (Luke 
10:42). It is holiness that makes our service effective.
In 5:8, we read that “although He was a Son He learned obedience from 
the things He suffered.” Jesus had to learn obedience. ‘Learn’ is a word 
connected with education. Jesus had to get an education in obedience 
in the days of His flesh. As God in heaven, He had never obeyed anyone. 
If   you have never done something in your whole life, then when you do 
it for the first time, you learn something. Jesus learnt to obey when He 
came to earth as a Man. Then He not only had to obey His Father, He had 
to obey Joseph and Mary as well. Joseph and Mary were sinful, imperfect 
people. They must have made mistakes, just like all parents do. Yet Jesus 
obeyed them. That must have been difficult. He obeyed and suffered in 
His obedience. That means that He suffered the pain of denying His own 
will and obeying His Father, all through His life. That is how He learnt 
obedience when it cost Him suffering.
Some  areas  of  obedience  can  be  enjoyable.  If  you  tell  your  child  to  
eat  up  his  ice-cream,  he  enjoys  obeying  you.  There  is  no  suffering  for  
him there. But when he is playing with his friends and you tell him to 
stop playing and come in and do his homework, then obedience becomes 
painful.  Even  so,  in  our  life,  there  are  certain  areas  where  obedience  
may be easy and enjoyable. We obey knowing that it is good for us. But 
the real test of our obedience is when we have to do something that we 

884 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
don’t like to do, something that involves denying our will, something that 
brings us pain. That is where our obedience is tested.
Jesus learned obedience by denying Himself. Anything that His Father 
said, “No,” to, He also said, “No” to. He learned obedience through the 
things  He  suffered,  and  at  the  end  of  this  education  “He  was  made  
perfect”  (5:9).  “Perfect”  here  means  “complete”.  Jesus  graduated  and  
got His degree. It is the same degree that we also need to get. We too 
have to overcome numerous temptations as He did. What happens if 
we  fail  in  a  test?  Then  we  have  to  do  that  test  again!  When  we  pass  
all our tests finally, we get our degree. Then we are overcomers! That 
is the most important degree in life that we can ever get. Every other 
degree is, comparatively speaking, rubbish. When Jesus says, “Follow 
me”, He is asking us to do what He did as the Captain of our salvation. 
He will never ask us to face a temptation that He Himself never faced. 
Let us go boldly then to the throne of grace and get grace to help us 
complete our education. If we have to suffer, we will suffer. But we are 
determined to learn obedience and complete our education.
In 5:9, we read, “Having been made perfect, He became to all those who 
obey  Him  the  source  of  eternal  salvation.”  Jesus  has  now  become  the  
Professor in this college of obedience. He went through the same college 
from the lowest level to the highest – and obeyed in everything. 
We as servants of God are now called to be junior lecturers in this same 
college of obedience. The more you have learnt obedience through suffer-
ing, the more you can be a true servant of the Lord who leads others also 
to obedience. That alone is true Christian ministry. But if you keep on 
failing in your tests, how can you be a lecturer in this college? 
“He has become to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salva-
tion” (5:9). This “eternal salvation” is not referring to salvation from the 
penalty of sin, but rather to salvation from the power of sin in daily life. 
Jesus has been designated by God as a High Priest according to the 
order of Melchizedek (5:10). Melchizedek was a man in the Old Testament 
who obeyed God (Genesis 14:18). When God told him to take some food 
to  someone  unknown  to  him  (Abraham),  he  obeyed  promptly.  We  read  
further, in 5:11. “Concerning this Jesus after the order of Melchizedek we 
have got a lot of things to say, but it is very hard to explain this because 
you people don’t seem to be interested in this.” They were not interested 
in  an  overcoming  life  or  in  godliness.  Can  you  imagine  trying  to  teach  
people about godliness who are not interested in godliness? That would 
be like a teacher trying to teach some important subject to students who 
are more interested in the score at a “World Cup” game going on at the 
same time. The teacher may be trying to teach mathematics or science. 
But  nobody  is  listening.  Their  mind  is  on  a  game.  That  is  exactly  how  
many  believers  are.  They  are  thinking  more  about  getting  a  promotion

Hebrews
or building a house or getting married. There is nothing wrong in any of 
these things. But if godliness is not your primary passion, then it is very 
hard to understand these truths.
Observe research scientists. They will sit up, late into the night, doing 
research because they have a terrific passion to discover something new 
in that field. When you have a passion like that to study the word of God 
because you want godliness, you will understand its secret. But it is diffi-
cult to explain this to those who don’t have a passion to be pure.
Growing to Maturity
Those Hebrew Christians were still babies who needed milk and not solid 
food.  Everyone  who  partakes  of  milk  is  not  accustomed  to  the  word  of  
righteousness (Hebrews 5:12, 13). Even today there are many “babies” in 
churches who have been believers for 25 years and still cannot eat solid 
food. They are satisfied with just milk – the message of repentance, faith 
in  Jesus,  forgiveness  of  sins,  water-baptism,  and  baptism  in  the  Holy  
Spirit. That is all they want. They have no interest in the word of right-
eousness. They should have become teachers in this college of obedience 
by now. But they were still in the kindergarten, satisfied with knowing 
just the A, B, C of the Christian life.
Many churches are full of babies. You can find 200 babies in a church 
feeding on their milk bottles every Sunday morning. They have no ear for 
the deeper truths of God’s word. They don’t want to hear about perfec-
tion.  Solid  food  is  for  the  mature  who  by  practice  have  exercised  their  
senses to discern between good and evil (5:14). What that means is that, 
in different situations they faced, they exercised their senses to discern 
between what was soulish (human) and what was spiritual (divine) – and 
they  chose  the  spiritual.  For  example,  in  speech,  they  did  not  merely  
avoid the sinful. They also avoided a human response and responded in 
a Christ-like way. When a Christian justifies his carnal actions with the 
excuse,  “After  all  we  are  only  human”,  he  is  a  babe.  Paul  rebuked  the  
Corinthians saying, “You are walking like mere men” (1 Corinthians 3:3). 
Is it wrong to behave like other children of Adam? Of course. We should 
behave like Christ.
When you preach God’s word, do you speak like men or do you speak 
like Jesus? Anyone who stands to preach God’s word in a pulpit must 
say, “Lord, I want to preach like You preached.” When God called me to 
preach His Word, as a young man, I prayed earnestly, “Lord, I want to 
preach just like You preached.” I didn’t want to make any man on earth 
my  model.  I  studied  the  four  gospels  to  see  how  Jesus  preached.  He  
became my Example. I want to encourage all of you to discern between 
soulish  preaching  and  spiritual  preaching,  and  between  a  soulish  way  
of living and a spiritual way of living. We must all develop our spiritual 
senses to discern that.

886 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
In 6:1–3,  the  writer  goes  on  to  speak  about  pressing  on  to  maturity.  
In Chapter 5, he used the illustration of drinking milk and eating meat. 
Now  he  uses  two  more  illustrations.  First,  the  example  of  elementary  
teaching and advanced teaching; and then the example of the foundation 
of a building and its superstructure. All these word-pictures are meant 
to  contrast  babies  with  mature  Christians.  The  difference  between  the  
two  is  seen  in  times  of  temptation.  The  mature  saint  has  a  Christlike 
response to temptation, while babies have a human response.
Most believers behave in a human way – and not in a Divine way. Let 
us examine ourselves. For example, when sitting with others, if you crack 
a  joke  that  embarrasses  another  person,  do  you  ask  yourself  immedi-
ately whether Jesus would ever crack a joke like that? If you never ask 
such questions, you will never get light on your human behaviour – and 
you  will  always  remain  a  baby-Christian.  It  is  good  to  check  ourselves  
at different times during each day, to see if we are acting (and reacting) 
as Jesus would in a similar situation. If you never examine yourself like 
that,  you  will  never  grow.  Then  you  will  forever  be  living  with  only  a  
foundation and nothing ever being built on it. You will be forever in the 
kindergarten  class,  forever  drinking  only  milk.  But  if  you  listen  to  the  
Holy Spirit, and are serious about advancing in your spiritual education, 
you will mature very quickly.
To use another illustration: Think of pressing on to maturity like climb-
ing a mountain (of say, 10,000 metres). Jesus has already reached the 
top. When we are born again we start at the foot of this mountain. Our 
goal is to follow Jesus and to press on towards the top, no matter how 
long it may take. Then we can say to our younger brothers and sisters, 
“Follow me as I follow Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1), even if we have climbed 
only 100 metres.
What is the foundation? What is milk? What do we learn in the kinder-
garten class? Repentance, first of all (6:1). That means to turn away not 
only  from  sin  but  also  from  dead  works.  Under  the  Old  Covenant  they  
had only good works and evil works. But in the New Covenant we have 
good works, evil works and dead works. Dead works are good works done 
with  a  bad  motive.  For  example,  preaching  God’s  Word  is  a  very  good  
thing to do. But if someone preaches for honour or for money, then it is 
a dead work. If we do something good, like giving money for God’s work 
but do it unhappily, then it becomes a dead work. There are many such 
examples. Anything you do without faith and without joy is a dead work, 
even if it does good to other people. We need to repent from such dead 
works. We need to repent of our selfish motives.
The other parts of the foundation are faith in Jesus, being baptised in 
water,  receiving  the  baptism  in  the  Holy  Spirit,  receiving  spiritual  gifts  
(“laying on of hands”), waiting for the resurrection of the dead at Christ’s 
return  and  being  ready  for  the  final  judgement  (2  Corinthians  5:10). 
These  are  all  kindergarten-lessons.  Christians  who  are  occupied  only  

Can We Fall Away?                                                                                                                                   887
Hebrews
with these are still in the kindergarten. Their house is still at the founda-
tion level. We must press on from here to maturity and perfection – to be 
increasingly like Jesus, in every area of our life. 
The burden of the writer of Hebrews is that Christians must go beyond 
the  milk-level  to  solid-food-level,  beyond  foundation  to  superstructure,  
beyond  the  kindergarten  class  to  higher  classes.  In  our  earthly  life,  
no-one would want to remain a baby forever. No-one would want to stop 
his education with the kindergarten. No-one would want to have a build-
ing with only a foundation. Yet many believers seem to be satisfied with 
just that. Even many preachers and pastors are babies. The result is that 
their churches are also full of babies. 
In 6:1, it says, “Let us press on to perfection.” If we are gripped only with 
foundation-doctrines, we will only produce babies through our preach-
ing.  The  main  message  of  the  New  Covenant  is  not  just  to  get  people’s  
sin’s forgiven. If it had been so, then the Word would have said, “Let us 
produce more babies”! But we are exhorted instead to press on to matu-
rity. Every baby must grow up to maturity.
It’s because churches are full of babies, that they have so many quar-
rels and court cases, with even leaders falling into adultery and running 
after money and fighting with each other, etc. Babies will always fight. 
When we grow up to maturity we don’t fight and we won’t covet any posi-
tion or honour in the church. If you fight or covet position or honour in the 
church, you are still a baby. Unfortunately many leaders in Christendom 
today  are  still  babies.  To  build  a  church  with  babies  is  like  building  a  
house with just a foundation and no roof or walls.
Can We Fall Away?
The writer then goes on to speak in Chapter 6 about the danger of not 
pressing on to perfection. Earthly foundations may last a long time even 
if  nothing  is  built  on  it.  But  in  spiritual  matters,  if  you  don’t  build  a  
superstructure on the foundation (or in other words, if you don’t press 
on to perfection), then the foundation itself will be eroded one day. The 
believer will lose his salvation, the Holy Spirit will leave him and he will 
lose his faith, his repentance and everything. We have seen that happen-
ing in many places.
In 6:4,  5, we read a five-fold description of a born-again Christian. 
He is first of all ‘enlightened.’ Light came into his dark heart. Secondly, 
he  has  “tasted  the  heavenly  gift”  –  the  gift  of  salvation  through  Jesus  
Christ. Thirdly, he has been “made a partaker of the Holy Spirit”. He is 
not just a nominal Christian. He has received the Holy Spirit. Fourthly, 
he has “tasted the good word of God”. He has responded to God’s word. 
Fifthly, he has “tasted of the powers of the age to come”. That means he 
has  tasted  something  of  God’s  supernatural  power  in  his  life.  He  has  
tasted the miraculous. He has tasted supernatural answers to prayer in 

888 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
impossible  situations.  Healing  from  sickness  is  a  part  of  “tasting  the  
power of the age to come”. In the future age I will have a resurrected body 
in  perfect  health  without  any  sickness.  I  can’t  have  that  body  today.  
But I can have a taste of it – through physical healing. Healing is a little 
sample of what we will get in fullness one day in the future. We cannot 
claim healing from every sickness now, as our right or privilege. But in 
God’s  goodness  and  in  His  sovereignty,  He  allows  us  at  times  to  taste  
this power and to be healed when we are sick. Whenever I am sick I pray, 
“Lord, give me a taste in my body of that resurrection power which will 
one day transform my whole body into the likeness of Jesus’ body. I know 
that I can’t have it fully now. But give me a taste of it in Jesus’ Name.” 
God decides when and to whom He gives a taste of that. It is His sover-
eign decision. I have tasted it many a time.
But a person who has experienced all this can still fall away if he is 
careless and rebellious and abuses God’s grace (6:4). This is not referring 
to a believer who falls and gets up again. We have all experienced that. 
This is referring to someone who falls away.
If the Bible says that a believer can fall away like that I believe it. If God 
has said that it is possible then it is definitely possible. If your under-
standing disagrees with that, then just acknowledge that your theology 
is  wrong  and  that  God  is  right.  Many  people  come  to  Scripture  with  a  
preconceived idea of what it should say. Thus they remain blind to what 
the Bible actually says. If you want to know what the Bible really says, 
then you must come to the Bible with a totally open mind. Get rid of all 
your  preconceived  ideas  and  say,  “Lord,  open  my  eyes.  Maybe  what  I  
have always believed is wrong.” The Bible was written for simple people, 
for fishermen, not for intelligent scholars. God hides His truths from the 
clever and the intelligent and reveals them to those who are humble like 
babes (Matthew 11:25).
Why do such believers fall away? Because “they crucify the Son of God 
afresh” (6:6). What does that mean? It was sin that crucified Christ. And 
so whenever a believer (who has seen clearly that Christ died for his sins) 
takes sin lightly in his life and keeps on sinning deliberately, thus despis-
ing the grace of God, he is crucifying Christ all over again. When he sins 
deliberately, he is saying “Crucify Him, crucify Him”, just like the crowds 
said in relation to Jesus.
Jesus need never have been crucified if man had not sinned. When I 
explain the gospel to little children I tell them, “Even if you were the only 
boy or girl in the whole world who did something wrong and everybody 
else was good, Jesus would still have come down from heaven and died 
for  you”.  That  is  the  gospel.  If  you  were  the  only  sinner  in  the  whole  
world and everybody else was holy, Jesus would still have come and died 
for  you.  For  whose  sins  would  He  have  died  then?  Only  for  your  sins!  
You can believe that Jesus died for the sins of the whole world and still 
remain unconverted. The day you realise that it was for your sins that 

Can We Fall Away?                                                                                                                                   889
Hebrews
Jesus died, you will be converted. It was your sins that crucified Him. 
So  every  time  you  sin,  you  are  crucifying  Him  afresh.  I  am  not  talking  
about slipping and falling in sin. I am talking about deliberately sinning. 
The difference between the two is like the difference between accidentally 
stamping on somebody’s foot and deliberately stamping on it! At times 
you may accidentally lose your temper. But there are other times, when 
you may plan and scheme to sin. Such sins are much more serious than 
accidental ones. If you accidentally put a nail into the hands of Jesus, 
that’s not as serious as deliberately nailing Him. We may fall into sexu-
ally lustful thoughts accidentally. Perhaps you did not expect that there 
would be a filthy indecent picture in that magazine. But it was there and 
you saw it and were suddenly tempted. That is quite different from going 
and buying a pornographic magazine and looking at it. When you keep 
on sinning deliberately, you are crucifying the Son of God afresh.
It is possible for a believer to keep on sinning deliberately and thus lose 
his salvation. For example, if he keeps on refusing to forgive someone, 
God will not forgive him (according to Matthew 6:15). Then he will be 
lost and go to hell, even though he may once have been saved. When 
Jesus  hung  on  the  cross,  He  said,  “Father  forgive  them.”  But  if  you  
say, “No, I won’t forgive him,” then you are crucifying the Son of God 
afresh. You will then fall away. It was a terrible shame for Jesus to be 
crucified openly, hanging almost naked, before all men. And when you 
sin deliberately, you are “putting Christ to an open shame” once again 
(6:6). That’s how we must see deliberate sin. And as long as a person 
keeps  on  crucifying  Christ  like  that,  it  is  impossible  to  bring  him  to  
repentance. But if he comes to his senses and sees the seriousness of 
his sin as being equivalent to crucifying Christ afresh, then he can still 
repent and come back to God.
6:7 indicates that a believer who keeps on sinning is only interested 
in God’s blessing on his life, but not in bringing forth fruit in his life for 
God’s glory. He keeps on drinking the rain, but instead of bringing forth 
vegetation  that  is  useful  to  others,  he  brings  forth  thorns  and  thistles  
(6:8).  He  will  attend  meetings  that  teach  that  God  will  bless  him  with  
wealth and health but not meetings that tell him how he can be free from 
sin.  God  bless  him.  But  what  does  he  bring  forth  after  drinking  in  all  
this  rain  from  heaven?  Not  love,  joy,  peace,  long  suffering,  gentleness,  
goodness,  faithfulness,  meekness  and  self-control,  but  bitterness,  an  
unforgiving spirit, sexual sin, etc. He takes advantage of the grace of God 
and never repents. That is a very dangerous path for anyone to walk in.
The blessings of the new covenant are greater than the blessings of the 
old covenant. But if you fall away from the new covenant the fall will be 
greater too. If you fall from a height of 3 metres, you can be hurt. But 
it  won’t  kill  you.  But  if  you  fall  from  a  height  of  300  metres,  that  will  

890 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
kill  you.  When  old  covenant  people  like  David  fell  into  adultery,  it  was  
like falling from a height of 3 metres. That was bad, but not very serious, 
because God had not done any great work in David. But now that Christ 
and the Holy Spirit have lifted us to heaven itself in the new covenant, if 
we fall, it can lead to spiritual death. 
A  donkey  can  never  rise  to  great  heights;  but  it  cannot  fall  to  great  
depths  either.  A  donkey  could  never,  for  example,  have  become  Satan.  
Only the highest of God’s created beings (an angel) could fall and become 
Satan.  The  greater  the  work  God  does  in  us,  the  greater  the  spiritual  
injury, when we fall.
The Israelites were forgiven by God nine times for their disobedience. 
But  when  they  disobeyed  Him  the  tenth  time,  they  were  not  allowed  to  
enter Canaan (Number 14:22, 23). But Moses, their leader, was not given 
even  one  chance.  When  he  disobeyed  God  just  once,  he  was  punished  
immediately and not allowed to enter Canaan (Numbers 20:12). Why the 
difference? Because when God gives more to someone, He requires more 
from him as well.
So, in this new covenant age, if a church-leader falls into adultery, it is 
not proper for him to come back into leadership – as David did under the 
old covenant. If he repents, he can be restored to fellowship with God and 
become a member in his church again; but he cannot be given spiritual 
leadership in that church thereafter. The higher a man rises, the more 
serious it is when he falls.
Under the old covenant, people followed Moses. But we follow Jesus. 
The difference in spiritual height between Moses and Jesus is vast. And 
so falling is a more serious thing when we are disciples of Jesus. But the 
writer goes on to say that although he has given this warning, he believes 
that they will not fall away like that (6:9).
But along with those strong words he also adds a word of encourage-
ment. “God is not unrighteous. He has not forgotten your work or the love 
you have shown to His name in serving other believers” (6:10). Jesus said 
that  anyone  who  gave  a  cup  of  cold  water  in  His  name  would  not  lose  
his reward. Then he goes on to say: “I desire that you will continue with 
the same diligence and the full assurance of hope until the end” (6:11). He 
encourages  them  not  to  be  lazy  but  to  press  on  until  the  end  with  the  
same  diligence.  There  is  no  time  in  the  Christian  life  when  we  should  
be lazy. Even if you are 90 years old, press on and serve the Lord. Don’t 
waste a single day of your life.
I have been constantly challenged by this poem of A.B. Simpson’s:
No time for trifling in this life of mine
Not this the path the blessed Master trod;
But strenuous toil – each hour and power employed
Always and all for God.

Jesus Our High Priest                                                                                                                                891
Hebrews
Time swiftly flies – eternity is near,
And soon my dust may lie beneath the sod.
How dare I waste my life, or cease to be
Always and all for God.
Every day of Jesus’ life and every bit of energy in His body were devoted 
100% for His Father. And that is how we too are to live until the end of 
our  days.  If  you  are  lazy,  you  will  never  enter  into  this  new  covenant  
life. You have to be radical and wholehearted. You have to give up many 
things that worldly people are interested in, and concentrate on things 
of eternal value. I am not saying that you can’t go for a picnic or have a 
little entertainment. But make sure that even your times of relaxation are 
kept in their proper proportion.
Many Christians do not spend time studying the Scriptures. They say 
they are busy. But we can find the time if we want to. So, “don’t  be  
sluggish, but be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit 
the promises” (6:12).
Jesus Our High Priest
Faith and patience are always linked together in the new covenant. When 
God gave the promise of a son to Abraham at the age of 75, it took 25 
years for Abraham to receive that son. But “he patiently waited and he 
obtained the promise” (6:15).
God told Abraham, “I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you” 
(6:14). Under the old covenant, when God blessed a man he had children. 
That  was  part  of  the  old  covenant  promise:  “I  will  bless  you  and  I  will  
multiply you.” In the new covenant, the same is true spiritually. When God 
blesses us He gives us spiritual children. If God had told Abraham, “I will 
bless you but you won’t have any children,” Abraham would have been 
terribly disappointed. And if God tells me today that He will bless me, but 
He won’t give me any spiritual children, I will be terribly disappointed too. 
God did not disappoint Abraham – and He won’t disappoint us.
God gave Abraham a son who would fulfil his vision. And when God 
blesses us He will give us brothers who have the same vision, the same 
passion, the same desire and the same longing as we have. Jesus had 11 
such disciples. If you say that God is blessing you but you don’t repro-
duce even one person like yourself, something is wrong. The will of God 
is that we have spiritual children who have the same passion and vision 
that we have.
When  people  look  at  our  physical  children,  they  say,  “He  looks  like  
Daddy”  –  the  same  colour  and  facial  features,  etc.  And  spiritually,  our  
children will have the same passion, the same longing and the same desire 
that we have. That must be our desire for our local church. When God 

892 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
blesses  us  He  will  multiply  us.  But  like  Abraham,  we  will  have  to  wait  
patiently  for  it.  Abraham  waited  in  faith  and  received  the  promise.  So  
will we.
God had given us two unchangeable things – His word and His oath 
(6:16–18). With those two, we can lay hold of the hope set before us – a 
hope that is the anchor for our soul. What is that hope? Many Christians 
say that their hope is the second coming of Christ. But that is only half 
our hope. 1 John 3:2 says that He will come again and when He comes 
we will be like Him. Those are the two parts of our hope. The next verse 
(1 John 3:3) goes on to say that “everyone who has this hope will purify 
himself, just as Christ is pure.” This double hope is called “the sure and 
steadfast anchor of our soul” (6:19).
When a ship drops an anchor it cannot move. We saw earlier in Chapter 2 
about the danger of drifting. The way to stop drifting is by dropping this 
anchor  –  the  anchor  of  hope  that  we  will  become  like  Jesus  one  day.  
If   you have any other goal in life than that – such as, to make plenty of 
money or to be a great preacher – you will certainly drift. It doesn’t matter 
whether  you  are  a  mother  looking  after  many  children  at  home,  or  an  
evangelist bringing many people to Christ around the world. The anchor 
for both is the same – the hope of becoming like Jesus. One is not more 
important to God than the other.
Here  we  read  that  Jesus  has  gone  inside  the  veil  as  our  Forerunner 
(6:20). This is a title of Jesus that is not well known. Most Christians 
have heard of Jesus as their Shepherd, the Way, the Truth, the Life, and 
as their Saviour, Lord, King and Healer. But very few have heard of Him 
as their Forerunner? Many believers don’t even know about this verse.
The book of Hebrews is one of the most important books in the New 
Testament,  next  to  the  gospels.  Only  in  Hebrews, do  we  read  of  Jesus  
as  our  Forerunner,  Who  was  made  like  us  in  all  things  and  Who  was  
tempted like us in all points, without sinning, because He prayed with 
loud crying and tears (2:17; 4:15; 5:7). Only in Hebrews do we read about 
the terms of the new covenant (8:10–12), about the new and living way 
that Jesus opened for us through His flesh (10:20) and how we can press 
on  to  perfection  in  His  footsteps  (6:1; 12:1,  2),  etc.  This  is  a  very,  very  
important  book;  and  that  is  why  Satan  prevents  most  believers  from  
studying this book seriously. He doesn’t want them to be overcomers, or 
to press on to perfection, or to drop an anchor and stop drifting.
In 7:1, we read about Melchizedek – the king of Salem (or Jerusalem). 
The  priesthood  of  Melchizedek  is  shown  to  be  greater  than  the  priest-
hood  of  Levi.  And  the  writer  proves  this  in  an  interesting  way.  When  
Abraham  met  Melchizedek  he  gave  Melchizedek  10%  of  all  the  spoils  
he had collected in the war (7:4). And since Levi, as a descendant, was 
within  Abraham’s  body  then,  Levi  also  gave  that  tithe  to  Melchizedek.  

Jesus Our High Priest                                                                                                                                893
Hebrews
Therefore  Melchizedek  is  greater  than  Levi!!  Since  Jesus  has  been  
appointed as a priest of the order of Melchizedek, His priesthood is there-
fore greater than that of Levi.
The  Levitical  priests  taught  people  to  pay  their  tithes.  They  would  
threaten  people  saying  that  God  would  curse  those  who  did  not  pay  
their tithes (Malachi 3:10). But Melchizedek never asked Abraham for his 
tithe. He only accepted a gift that Abraham gave voluntarily. In the new 
covenant, all gifts are voluntary; and there is no command to tithe. God’s 
people give voluntary gifts just like Abraham gave to Melchizedek. Jesus 
never asked anyone to give their tithes to support Him. He accepted only 
what people gave Him voluntarily (Luke 8:2, 3).
Most of Christendom today follows the practices of the priesthood of 
Levi. When a pastor tells people to pay their tithes to support him and 
his ministry, he is not following Jesus’ example but the example of the 
Levitical  priests.  Those  priests  wore  a  long  dress  to  distinguish  them  
from other people. And that is how many “Christian” priests and bishops 
dress today also. Jesus and the apostles however dressed just like the 
ordinary  people  of  their  day.  In  the  priesthood  of  Levi  they  also  had  a  
special building which they called the house of God – the temple. Today 
also many churches are called the house of God or “the sanctuary”. All 
this is going back to the old covenant. Most Christians live under the old 
covenant – and that is why they are defeated by sin as well.
Melchizedek  however  was  totally  different  from  all  this.  He  went  to  
meet  Abraham,  taking  some  food  with  him  to  bless  Abraham  and  his  
many servants. He did not go to get any money from Abraham. He did not 
need that, because he was a king. He was not dependent on Abraham’s 
gifts.  Abraham  gave  him  a  gift  from  the  spoils  of  war,  just  to  show  his  
gratitude  for  the  vast  amount  of  food  that  Melchizedek  had  brought  to  
feed  Abraham’s  retinue  of  318  servants.  Melchizedek  accepted  the  gift  
graciously and blessed Abraham with the blessing of God. Paul was like 
Melchizedek  too,  for  he  also  said  to  the  Philippians  that  he  accepted  
their gift only so that God would bless them (Philippians 4:16–19). The 
priesthood of Levi however was totally different. They were dependent on 
people’s gifts and so they would force the people to pay their tithes.  We  
can learn a lot about the right financial principles for Christian work by 
comparing the priesthood of Levi with that of Melchizedek.
Melchizedek had the dignity of a king. Jesus and Paul had that too. And 
so does every genuine servant of God. Jesus and Paul trusted God alone 
for their needs. When they received gifts from others, it was in order that 
the  people  who  gave  the  gifts  would  be  blessed,  and  not  because  they  
coveted what the people had. Pastors who want to manifest the dignity of 
the priesthood of Melchizedek (of which Jesus is the High Priest) should 
not descend to the methods of the Levitical priests.
The Levitical priests did not have the dignity of a king. They kept on 
asking people for their tithes. When the people did not pay their tithes to 

894 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
the Levites (in the time of Nehemiah), they stopped working as priests and 
started farming (Nehemiah 13:10). They served God only when they were 
paid each month. And that is exactly how most preachers and pastors 
work for God today. Melchizedek was totally different. He behaved with 
the dignity of a king even in the presence of a rich man like Abraham. 
Where do we find servants of God like that today? Most pastors flatter 
rich people in order to get their money.
Melchizedek  was  a  picture  of  Christ  in  other  ways  too.  He  was  a  
king of righteousness (by his name), and a king of peace (Salem means 
“peace”)  (7:2).  Righteousness  and  peace  met  together  in  Jesus  Christ  
(Psalm  85:10).  Further,  Melchizedek  appears  in  the  book  of  Genesis  –  
which is a book of beginnings and where the genealogy of every man of 
God is clearly indicated – whether it be of Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob 
or Joseph. The lineage of all these men from Adam downwards is clearly 
shown. But there is no record there of Melchizedek’s father or mother. 
In the same way, the deaths of all these men of God in Genesis are also 
mentioned. But Melchizedek’s death is not mentioned. In this way also, 
Melchizedek  is  a  type  of  Jesus  who  lived  from  all  eternity  in  heaven:  
“Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither begin-
ning of days nor end of life” (7:3).
Jesus is different in yet another way too. The priests in the old cove-
nant had to offer sacrifices for sin, every day. But Jesus offered up his 
body as a sacrifice just once (7:26–28). And when those priests offered 
their sacrifices, it was for the sins of the people as well as for their own 
sins. Jesus however offered His body only for the sins of the people. He 
had no sin Himself. The absolute purity of Christ as a Man described in 
7:26. “This High Priest of ours is not like other high priests on earth. He is 
holy, innocent, undefiled, completely separated from sinners.” There was 
not a trace of sin in Him, unconscious, conscious or of any other type. He 
lived a perfect life on earth.
Notice another fundamental difference in these two priesthoods. Under 
the old covenant, a man became a priest by a carnal commandment: He 
had  to  be  a  descendant  of  Levi.  Jesus  however  became  the  Guarantor  
of  a  better  covenant  by  the  power  of  an  indestructible  life  (7:16,  22). 
The priesthood of Levi depended on earthly qualifications. But it is not 
so in the new covenant. If you imagine that you can serve God because 
you have a Bible school degree, you are back to the priesthood of Levi. 
In the priesthood of Melchizedek, what you need is a life that cannot be 
destroyed  by  sin  (7:16).  It  is  the  indestructible  life  of  Jesus  within  us  
alone that can qualify us to be servants of God in the new covenant. The 
more we have of this heavenly life, the more effective we will be as new 
covenant priests of the order of Melchizedek.
In 7:25, we read that Jesus lives to make intercession for us in heaven. 
That  is  yet  another  mark  of  the  priesthood  of  Melchizedek.  They  pray  
for  others.  They  pray  that  the  Lord  will  bless  the  people  whom  they  

The Glorious New Covenant                                                                                                                   895
Hebrews
preach  to.  And  Jesus  Himself  intercedes  for  us.  In  the  Levitical  priest-
hood, they just prayed routine, formal prayers, did their jobs and went 
home.  But  Jesus  and  His  priests  are  devoted  to  prayer.  Take  time  to  
study Hebrews  7  and  see  the  difference  between  the  old  covenant  and  
new covenant priesthoods.
The Glorious New Covenant
Chapter  8  continues  with  the  theme  of  the  difference  between  the  old  
covenant and the new covenant. Jesus is our High Priest at the right hand 
of God in heaven. The tabernacle that Moses built was actually a shadow 
of the heavenly realities (8:5). That was why God told Moses, “Make sure 
when  building  the  tabernacle  that  everything  is  exactly  according  to  the  
pattern I gave you on the mountain.” In the same way, when we build the 
church and in all our ministry, everything must be exactly as God has 
taught us in the new covenant. So it is tragic to see people who call them-
selves new covenant believers going back to the rules of the priesthood of 
Levi! That is one reason why the glory has departed. In the Old Testament 
Moses did everything exactly according to the pattern that God showed 
him. He didn’t change it, modify it, or bring in his human ideas into it. 
And then the glory of God came upon that tabernacle. If we build a new 
covenant church today exactly as taught in the New Testament, we will 
see the glory of God too. Today our pattern is Jesus Himself. In the old 
covenant, they had a scroll giving all the details of the tabernacle. Today 
our pattern is found in a Person. We have to pattern our life and ministry 
exactly according to the pattern Jesus has shown us.
So,  to  be  a  new  covenant  servant,  we  must  look  at  Jesus  more  and  
more. Consider Him. Look at this High Priest of ours. Pattern your life 
and ministry more and more after Him. If you want to know how to serve 
the Lord, look at Jesus and see how He served the Father. If you want 
to  know  how  to  preach,  see  how  Jesus  preached.  If  you  want  to  know  
how  to  live,  study  how  Jesus  lived.  If  you  want  to  know  how  to  live  at  
home, look at how Jesus lived at home in subjection to His mother for 30 
years. If you want to know how to work, look at how Jesus worked in the 
carpenter’s shop. That is our pattern in every area. Make sure that you 
do exactly according to that pattern.
Then the new covenant is described in 8:7–13. Even the letter to the 
Romans does not explain the new covenant as clearly as it is done here 
in Hebrews.
If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need 
for a second covenant (Hebrews 8:7). What does that teach us? That the 
law was faulty. Don’t misunderstand this word “faulty”. This is not like 
a car manufacturer discovering some fault in his first model and then 
rectifying  it  in  the  next  model.  No.  God  knew  that  the  first  covenant 
could never accomplish what He desired for man. But He gave it to man 

896 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
for 1500 years, to teach man that however hard he tried he could never 
come up to His standards. No matter how hard he tried he would never 
be able to manifest His nature. The Israelites tried very hard and always 
failed. Moses lost his temper, David committed adultery, Elijah wanted 
to die, and John the Baptist lost his faith in Jesus as the Messiah when 
he was imprisoned. They could not live up to God’s standard. That was 
one purpose of the law.
For us too, our initial experience after being born again is somewhat 
like  that.  We  hear  a  message  about  victory  over  sin  –  and  we  try,  and  
try, and try. And we fail, and fail, and fail. Finally, some learn the lesson 
that they cannot get victory in their own strength. Then God leads such 
people  into  the  new  covenant.  It  is  the  same  lesson  –  of  our  spiritual  
impotence – that we have to learn when we seek to serve the Lord.
Even today, after more than fifty years of preaching, when I stand up 
to preach, I know that I am weak and helpless and cannot preach what 
the Lord wants me to preach in the way He wants me to preach it. I will be 
utterly foolish if I think I can depend on my past experience.” The anoint-
ing of the Holy Spirit is what we need every single time we speak, even if 
we have preached the same message a hundred times.
First  of  all,  in  the  new  covenant,  God  promises  not  only  to  forgive  our  
sins, but also never to remember our past sins (8:12). Under the old cove-
nant,  there  was  a  constant  remembrance  of  past  sins.  But  in  the  new  
covenant there is no remembrance of past sins at all. When you enter the 
new covenant, the first thing God does is to blot out your past life record. 
You  may  have  lived  a  very  wicked  life,  but  once  you  are  forgiven  and  
justified by the blood of Christ, God sees you as though you had never 
sinned in your entire life! All have sinned and come short of God’s glory. 
Some have sinned more than others. But God totally forgives everyone 
who repents. To use an illustration: If pass marks in an examination are 
40%, and someone gets 25% and you get zero, he is certainly better than 
you. But both of you have still failed. Then God in grace gives both of you 
100%. Thus both of you become equal in His eyes. This is the wonder of 
justification. Once you enter the new covenant, you must not look back 
to your past, except in gratitude to God for having forgiven you so much. 
Secondly, in the new covenant we can know God personally as our Father. 
God says “All shall know Me from the least to the greatest” (8:11). Every 
person, starting from the least to the greatest, can know God personally. 
In  the  world,  they  normally  say  “greatest  to  the  least”.  But  with  God,  
everything is the opposite of the world. He starts from the least. The least 
believer can know the Lord personally. You don’t have to go to a prophet 
to find out God’s will now. You can know God personally as your Father 
and  Friend  and  go  to  Him  at  any  time  with  any  need.  You  don’t  need  
somebody else through whom you go to God now. Others can teach you 

The Glorious New Covenant                                                                                                                   897
Hebrews
the Bible. But you don’t need anyone’s help to know God as your own 
Father. “Nobody will teach his neighbour saying, ‘Know the Lord.’ ” (8:11). 
This is your privilege under the new covenant.
Thirdly, God now promises to write His laws in our heart and in our mind. 
“I  will  put  My  laws  into  their  minds  and  write  them  upon  their  hearts” 
(8:10). In the old covenant, God wrote His laws on the outside – on tablets 
of stone. Now He writes His laws inside us. That means that God will now 
help us to obey Him. He says, The old covenant was full of “You shall”s 
and “You shall not”s (Exodus 20:1–17). In the new covenant however, God 
says, “I will, I will, I will, I will, I will” – 5 times (8:10–12). The old covenant 
could be likened to a master commanding his servant, “You must take 
care of all my property perfectly, you must keep the house perfectly tidy, 
you must wash the clothes perfectly clean, you must cook food perfectly, 
etc.” – and the servant is overwhelmed by these commands of his master. 
The new covenant however can be likened to a husband telling his wife, 
“Let  us  do  everything  together.  I  will  help  you  look  after  the  children,  
wash the clothes, keep the house tidy and even cook the food. I will help 
you in every task.” How much easier that makes things for a wife! The 
new covenant can also be likened to a father telling his small child, “I will 
hold your hand and teach you how to write the alphabet perfectly” In the 
new covenant, God holds me and helps me obey His commandments.
The  Lord  writing  His  laws  in  our  minds  means  that  He  gives  us  the  
desire  to  keep  His  laws.  His  writing  it  on  our  hearts  means  that  He  
also gives us the ability to keep those laws. What more do we need? In 
Philippians, we read the same thing in different words. “God works in us 
to will (= desire) and to do (=ability) His good pleasure” (Philippians 2:13). 
All we have to do is cooperate with God as He works within us.
Think  of  that  rock  in  Mount  Sinai  where  God  wrote  His  command-
ments.  That  rock  submitted  to  God.  When  God  wrote,  the  rock  (as  it  
were) said, “All right God, write on me.” And God wrote. That is what we 
have to do too – allow God to write His laws within us. Mary, the mother 
of Jesus, said to the angel Gabriel, “I submit to the Lord. Whatever the 
Lord has decided to do within me, let it take place.” She submitted – and 
God  created  the  body  of  Jesus  within  her  womb.  She  could  not  have  
produced that herself. At the same time God would not have produced 
that  body  in  her  womb  if  she  had  not  submitted.  Mary  submitted  and  
the Holy Spirit produced the body. That is a beautiful example for us. We 
submit and the Holy Spirit produces the nature of Christ within us. We 
do not have to produce the nature of Christ. In fact, we cannot. To try and 
produce the nature of Christ within us is as foolish as the virgin Mary 
just  determining  to  produce  a  baby  on  her  own!  She  could  never  have  
done that. The Holy Spirit had to produce that body. It is interesting to 
note that the New Testament begins with that story. Mary submitted and 
the Holy Spirit produced it. It has to be the same with us.

898 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
Jesus referred to The Holy Spirit as the finger of God (Compare Matthew 
12:28 with Luke 11:20). The Holy Spirit was the One Who wrote on the 
two tablets of stone in Sinai. And He is the One Who now writes God’s 
laws in our mind and on our heart. He is the One Who gives us the desire 
and the ability to do God’s will. In Nazareth, if Mary had not been willing 
to  submit  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  God  would  have  bypassed  her  and  found  
someone  else  to  be  the  mother  of  Jesus;  and  Mary  would  have  missed  
that  honour  and  privilege.  And  if  you  don’t  submit  to  the  Holy  Spirit  
today, God will bypass you and give the privilege of fulfilling the particu-
lar ministry (that God planned for you) to someone else. Don’t miss out 
on the privilege of fulfilling God’s perfect plan for your life.
In 8:13, we read that “the old covenant is obsolete”. In Chapter 9, the 
theme is the benefits that have come to us in the new covenant, through 
the better sacrifice that God provided for us. In the old covenant taber-
nacle, there was a thick veil between the Holy Place and the Most Holy 
Place. God was indicating to the people thereby that they could not enter 
into God’s immediate presence because of sin in their life. When Jesus 
shed His blood for us on the cross, the veil was torn and man could now 
enter God’s presence.
Jesus Our Perfect Offering
In 9:9 we read that the old covenant could not make a worshipper perfect 
in his conscience. There is a “perfection” that we cannot attain as long 
as we live on earth; but there is also a perfection that we can attain. To 
be totally perfect in our entire being, as Jesus was, is something that we 
can have only when Christ returns. But if we live in the new covenant, we 
can be ‘perfect in our conscience.’ With this perfection, we press on to the 
final perfection. We start with a perfect conscience and end with perfect 
likeness to Christ. So when we speak about perfection, we are only refer-
ring to being perfect in our conscience. We must distinguish between the 
things that differ. Otherwise we will be confused.
In 9:14, we are told that Jesus Christ offered Himself up without any 
blemish to God. How did He offer Himself to God without any blemish? 
He was tempted exactly like us, in so many ways during His 33½ years 
on earth. Yet He did not sin. How did He manage that? This verse gives us 
the answer: “Through the Eternal Spirit.” It was through the Holy Spirit’s 
power that Jesus remained without blemish. He lived on earth, not with 
His  inherent  power  as  God,  but  as  a  man  with  the  same  power  of  the  
Holy Spirit that He now offers us. With the Holy Spirit’s power we too can 
overcome temptation as He did. But you have to seek for that power and 
submit to it as Jesus did. It is just like the electric power that we have in 
our houses that powers up so many gadgets. That happens because we 
connect the power to all those gadgets. Through the Spirit’s power, we too 
can offer ourselves without blemish in our conscience to God.

Jesus Our Perfect Offering                                                                                                                       899
Hebrews
Jesus’ blood cleanses our conscience not only from sin but also from 
dead works (9:14). Dead works are works that may appear holy and 
good before men. But they are works done without love, without joy, 
without faith, without zeal, done for personal gain, and merely to ease 
one’s conscience, etc. We must repent and cleanse ourselves of these 
dead works before we can serve God.
9:27  is  a  very  important  verse.  It  says  that  it  is  appointed  for  men  
to  die  once  and  then  to  be  judged  by  God.  There  are  two  truths  that  
we can learn from this verse. First of all, that once a man dies there is 
nothing further for him to look forward to, but judgement. There is no 
second  chance  to  repent  after  death.  The  other  beautiful  truth  is  that  
God waits until a man dies before He judges him. He hopes that the man 
will  improve  any  time  before  he  dies.  Most  of  us  however  are  not  like  
that. We judge people long before they die – because we don’t hold out 
any hope for them! Let us learn to follow God’s example and wait until 
people die before we judge them. Thus we will also save ourselves from a 
lot of sinning. 
In 10:1, we read that the law could never make anyone perfect. Notice 
the  word  “perfect”  here  again.  What  was  the  fault  with  the  old  cove-
nant? In one sentence, we could say that it was this: It could not make 
anyone perfect. What is the mark of Christians who live under the old 
covenant  today?  They  are  afraid  of  the  word  ‘perfection’.  What  is  the  
main feature of the new covenant? It can make people perfect in their 
conscience and thus help them to press on to perfection in their life, till 
one day they become like Jesus.
If  you  are  serious  about  the  new  covenant  you  will  never  again  be  
afraid of the word ‘perfection’. You will long to be perfect. If you don’t have 
a longing to be perfect, you are an old-covenant Christian. 
In 10:5,  we  read  that  “God  doesn’t  want  our  offerings.”  I  quote  this  
verse  to  people  who  have  suffered  under  preachers  who  have  kept  on  
telling them that God wants their offerings. What does it say here that 
God desires from us? Our bodies. Under the old covenant, the empha-
sis  was,  “Pay  your  tithes  to  the  Levites.”  In  the  New  Testament  the  
emphasis  is,  “Give  your  bodies  to  God”  (Romans  12:1).  A  church  that  
is  constantly  asking  its  people  to  pay  their  tithes,  is  an  old-covenant  
church. A new-covenant church will emphasise presenting our bodies – 
our eyes, our hands, our tongues, etc., – as a living sacrifice to God. It 
is not material offerings that God desires from us today, but our bodies.
Giving our bodies to God is the new-covenant equivalent of the old-cov-
enant tithe – just like Christ dying on the cross is the equivalent of the 
old-covenant lamb sacrificed on the Passover day. Does this mean that 
we  don’t  have  to  give  any  money  now  for  the  work  of  God  on  earth?  

900 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
You  may  certainly  give,  but  God  wants  only  what  you  give  cheerfully  
(2  Corinthians  9:7).  In  any  case,  He  wants  your body first of all.  Those  
who give Him their bodies usually give Him everything else as well. But 
everything must be given cheerfully and joyfully.
When Jesus came into the world, He did not come to give tithes and 
material  offerings  to  His  Father  (10:5).  He  came  to  give  His  body  as  a  
sacrifice. And He is the Mediator of the new covenant and taught us that 
what God wants from us, primarily, is our body. 
Many give offerings of money and service to God. You may boast that 
you  have  distributed  hundreds  of  tracts,  or  served  as  a  missionary  in  
some difficult area for many years, or prayed for a number of hours, or 
fasted  for  many  days.  These  are  all  good  offerings.  But  those  offerings  
don’t  have  any  value  to  God,  if  you  still  lust  sexually  with  your  eyes  
and still get angry. Then you haven’t given Him what He wants first of 
all – your body. Then God will say to you, “Forget about giving Me your 
sacrifices and your offerings. Give Me your eyes and your tongue first of 
all. I want your body.” Don’t substitute material offerings for your body. 
People who value the material offerings they have given to God are back 
in the old covenant. In the new covenant what God wants is your body. 
The  book  of  Hebrews  is  one  of  the  most  important  books  in  the  Bible.  
If you want to live in the new covenant, study Hebrews.
Jesus never had a body when He was in heaven. When He came into 
this  world  the  Father  gave  Him  a  body.  What  was  He  to  do  with  that  
body? Was He to show His love for His Father by going to some difficult 
place like Africa as a missionary? Or was He to pray for 4 hours every 
day and fast twice a week? None of these. He says, “I have come (to earth), 
to do Your will O God – and not to make sacrifices” (10:7). This is what 
Jesus used His body for – and this is what we have to use our bodies for, 
as  well.  When  we  present  our  bodies  to  God,  it  is  to  do  His  will  there-
after with every part of them – with our eyes, hands, tongues, passions, 
desires,  etc.  Our  only  passion  in  life  thereafter  will  be  to  do  the  will  of  
God every day.
What is the will of God for us, first of all? “This is the will of God – even 
your sanctification” (1 Thessalonians 4:3). That is the first part of God’s 
will for every one of us. And when it comes to our ministry, we are not 
to rush here and there trying to do something for God. We must again 
do the will of God in our ministry. Jesus taught us to pray, “Thy will 
be done on earth as it is done in heaven.” The angels in heaven do not 
run around trying to be busy for God in some way or the other. Jesus 
also  did  not  run  around  trying  to  do  something  or  the  other  for  His  
Father. He sought the Father’s will and did just that. When the Father 
told Him to work as a carpenter from age 18 to 30, He did that. After 
He had been faithful in His earthly work for all those years, the Father 
told Him to go out and preach for 3½ years. Jesus was equally pleasing

to the Father when He was making stools and tables for 12 years as He 
was when preaching the gospel and healing the sick.
Jesus  did  not  come  to  earth  to  be  a  missionary  or  to  do  full-time  
work. He came only to do His Father’s will, whatever that was. When His 
Father’s will was carpentry, He did that. When His Father’s will was full-
time work, He did that. We must dedicate ourselves also to do the will of 
the Father, and not this job or that. God may call you to be a carpenter 
and not a missionary. Are you willing?
If I join the Indian Army, I cannot ask to be posted to a place of my 
choice.  I  have  to  go  where  they  tell  me  to  go.  They  can  post  me  to  the  
battle-front  or  they  can  post  me  in  the  supply  department  behind  the  
scenes. That is their choice. It is the same when we join the Lord’s army. 
Jesus said, “Lo, I come to do Your will, O God.” Thus He took away the 
first covenant and established the second covenant (10:8, 9).
In the first covenant there was a lot of religious activity – especially 
inside the tabernacle and the temple. But Jesus did not do any religious 
work  for  90%  of  His  earthly  life.  He  helped  His  mother  at  home  and  
supported  the  family  as  a  carpenter  –  for  30  years.  Then  He  preached  
for the next 3½ years. Thus He finished the work His Father gave Him 
to do and glorified Him (See John 17:4). We learn there that to help your 
mother at home is as important in God’s eyes as healing the sick. In the 
new covenant, whatever God wants you to do at a particular time that 
is God’s will – and that is the holiest thing you can do at that particular 
time. Many people have gone out into full-time ministry and missionary 
work without a clear call from God. They end up frustrated and discour-
aged. I have come across old missionaries who have made a mess of their 
lives  because  they  did  not  seek  the  will  of  God  but  went  out  to  “serve 
God in the foreign field”  because  someone  pressurised  them  to  do  so.  
Don’t  make  that  mistake  yourself.  Follow  Jesus’s  example.  He  has  set  
the pattern for us all.
Then the terms of the covenant are repeated in 10:16, 17: “I will put 
My laws upon their hearts and I will write them on their minds. I will not 
remember their sins any more.” This is so very important – and that is 
why they are repeated a second time.
A New and Living Way
10:19–25 is the central passage of Hebrews. It speaks about a new and 
living  way  that  Jesus  inaugurated  for  us  to  enter  into  the  immediate  
presence of God and live there permanently. This was God’s plan for man 
and this is our privilege in the new covenant. “We now have confidence, 
brethren, to enter into the Most Holy Place, (first of all) by the blood of 
Jesus  and  (secondly)  by  a  new  and  living  way  that  He  inaugurated  for  

902 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
us through the veil, that is, His flesh.”  The  veil  was  torn  in  the  temple  
when Jesus died. And that veil symbolised His flesh – that is His self-
will – which was rent (crucified) every day of His earthly life, so that He 
might do only His Father’s will at all times (John 6:38). This way is called 
the new and living way. “New” means “ever-fresh”. In Revelation 5:9, we 
read that they sang a new song in heaven about Jesus’ death on Calvary. 
How could that possibly be “new” song? It is fresh for all who sing it. It 
is as if they are hearing about Christ’s death for the very first time. This 
is how the Holy Spirit makes the death of Christ living and fresh for us 
constantly.  In  the  same  way,  the  way  of  following  Jesus  is  also  fresh  
and exciting for us every day. This is the ever-fresh way of the cross, the 
way of death to Self and to our own will, offering our bodies to do God’s 
will alone every day. As we saw earlier in this chapter, “Behold, I come to 
do Your will, O God.” We don’t have to rend the veil now, for Jesus has 
already rent the veil and opened the way. But we have to walk along it to 
live in God’s presence constantly.
Jesus has inaugurated this new road for us to walk in. It was not easy 
for Jesus to walk this way. He had to pay the price of death to Self every 
day  for  33½  years  to  inaugurate  this  way.  This  is  the  highway  of  holi-
ness that Jesus now invites us to walk in (Isaiah 35:8). But we must be 
careful not to be taken up with the way itself – the way of the cross. Our 
eyes should always be on the goal. Jesus endured the cross because of 
the joy set before Him of fellowship with the Father. If you are travelling 
from Chennai to Bangalore by a newly-made, excellent road, you will not 
spend your time admiring the road. Then you will never reach Bangalore. 
The road is only a means to reach your destination. So also, the way of 
the  cross  is  only  a  means  to  enter  the  Father’s  presence  and  to  dwell  
there every day. Many believers keep talking only about putting the flesh 
to death. But they are gloomy, miserable, judgemental of others and crit-
ical – proving that their flesh is still very alive!!  Thus  they  never  make  
any progress in their lives. After twenty years, they are still talking about 
the road and never seem to get any closer to their destination – they do 
not become any more Christlike. Our goal is Christlikeness and a closer 
fellowship with God.
We are not to run the race looking at the way but at Jesus (Hebrews 
12:1). Runners  never  look  at  the  road  they  are  running  on.  They  are  
always looking in front towards the finish line. People who look down at 
the road and run will come last in the race. If you are merely gripped with 
the message of the cross you are not holy. But if you are gripped with the 
Person of Jesus Himself, then you are holy.
The Lord has opened the way of the cross for us to walk in – and He 
is our High Priest and Forerunner. So we can now “draw near to God 
now with a sincere heart in the full assurance of faith, with our hearts 
cleansed  from  an  evil  conscience,  and  our  bodies  washed  with  pure  

A New and Living Way                                                                                                                             903

water” (10:22). That last phrase means that every sin that we commit-
ted with our bodies has been set right. We have apologised to all the 
people we hurt in any way, we have returned money that we cheated 
people of, etc. Thus our tongues and hands are cleansed from those 
defilements. We now “hold fast to the confession of our hope and do not 
waver”. We now think of our fellow-believers and “consider how to stir 
them up to love”. We no longer live for ourselves; and we seek to “fellow-
ship with other people as often as possible”, awaiting the return of our 
Lord eagerly (10:23–25). Take this passage – 10:19–25 – seriously and 
meditate on it. It’s a very important passage in Hebrews.
Then  the  writer  speaks  of  the  danger  of  sinning  deliberately.  Then  
there can be no more sacrifice for our sins. If we have truly repented our 
attitude to sin would have changed radically. We may fall in a moment of 
weakness. But we will hate sin and try our best to avoid it.
The new and living way is a way and not a gate. It is a way in which 
we  must  keep  moving  forward.  Later,  in  12:1,  the  writer  speaks  about  
running  the  race  looking  unto  Jesus.  Christians  backslide  when  they  
stop seeking to move forward. An aircraft in the sky stays up as long as 
it is moving. If it turns off its engines and stops, it immediately begins 
to  fall.  That  is  a  picture  of  the  Christian  life.  If  we  don’t  keep  moving  
forward, we will backslide.
The  writer  then  warns  us  about  Old  Testament  people  who  were  
punished without mercy when they sinned (10:28). Since God has called 
us with a much higher calling than them, our punishment will be greater 
if we take sin lightly now – for that amounts to trampling Christ under 
our feet, treating the blood of Jesus as something cheap and despising 
the Holy Spirit’s voice. It’s a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the 
living God (10:31).
He then goes on to say that we must be willing to suffer for Christ’s 
sake (10:32–34). People may take away our property. We should not be 
occupied with these earthly things. When persecution comes to India, 
we  may  lose  many  earthly  things  and  lose  our  honour  too.  We  may  
not  get  jobs  easily  because  we  are  Christians  seeking  to  be  upright,  
we may not get promotions. People may turn against us and they may 
tear down our church buildings. If we live in the Most Holy Place with 
God, we will be able to take these things joyfully (10:34). They will not 
disturb us, because we know that we have a much better possession 
in heaven.
But instead of going this way if we shrink back, then the Lord will have 
no pleasure in us (10:38). There are only two ways – either you will live by 
faith or you will shrink back. If you live by faith, you will make progress. 
The opposite of living by faith is shrinking back (10:38). So we see from 
that verse that all backsliding is primarily a failure of faith.

Hebrews
Heroes of Faith
Then in Chapter 11, he expands on the subject of faith. He says that God 
requiring faith  in  man  is  not  something  new.  Even  the  Old  Testament  
saints lived by faith. Abel offered a sacrifice to God by faith (11:4). Faith 
is defined as believing those invisible things which we know for certain 
are true. It is the firm conviction that the things we have not seen as yet 
we will receive. Abel had such faith and so he gave the best he had to 
God, because he knew that would please God (Genesis 4:4). Cain on the 
other hand gave a cheap offering to God (Genesis 4:3). Enoch also walked 
with  God  by  faith  for  300  years  (Hebrews  11:5). He  walked  by  faith  in  
an unseen God, pleasing Him, when all others were living only to please 
themselves.  God  tested  Enoch  for  300  years  and  then  took  him  up  to  
heaven.
Without this type of faith whatever other good qualities we may have, 
it  will  be  impossible  to  please  God  (11:6).  We  may  do  a  lot  of  work  for  
God and make many sacrifices for Him. But if we do not live by faith 
in  an  invisible  God,  we  cannot  please  Him.  Jesus  said  that  those  who  
believe without seeing Him are more blessed than those who believe after 
having  seen  Him  (John  20:29).  Do  you  want  to  please  God?  Then  you  
must believe two things about Him: First, that He really exists up there in 
heaven; and secondly that He rewards all those who seek Him diligently 
(Hebrews 11:6).
Do  you  really  believe  that  your  Father-God  is  there  in  heaven  –  for  
you? When you face some trouble or difficulty, who do you turn to first? 
If you live by faith, it will be God. There is nothing wrong in asking people 
for help. But the first person we turn to must be God. If the ruler of my 
country were my father, any time I had a problem I would just ring him 
up and say, “Dad, I have a bit of a problem. Can you help me?” And he 
would  say,  “Sure.  What  is  it?”  I  would  tell  him  my  problem  –  and  he  
would say, “Don’t worry, son. I will take care of that.” I would then put 
the phone down and be at rest. Do you believe that your Father in heaven 
is more powerful than the greatest rulers in the world? There are certain 
problems like sickness etc., that even powerful rulers cannot solve. But 
your heavenly Father can. Then why don’t you talk to Him first? Let us 
develop the habit of going to God first at all times, with our problems 
–  both  big  and  small.  “He  is  a  Rewarder  of  those  who  diligently  seek  
Him” (11:6).
Noah also lived by faith (11:7). He “condemned the world” by the way 
he  lived.  That’s  how  we  must  live  too.  When  people  saw  Noah  selling  
his property and spending all his savings to make the ark and preach-
ing that God’s judgement was going to come on the world – that was a 
condemnation of the world’s lifestyle. Because people in the world were 
using their money only to enjoy themselves. Noah however was denying 
himself all the time. He did not go on holidays, he did not waste money 
on buying fancy clothes or in luxurious living. He spent everything that

Hebrews
he could spare on building the ark. Thus he condemned the world. When 
a Christian’s primary passion is to build the church of Jesus Christ, he 
too is condemning the world. The people of the world will say, “You are 
crazy  spending  your  money  on  travelling  here  and  there  to  preach  the  
gospel and on Christian books, etc., when you could be spending it on 
enjoying yourself!” But the church is the only thing that will remain when 
Jesus comes back. If you have faith like Noah, it will radically change the 
way you spend your time, your energy and your money; and thus you will 
manifest your faith. What do people see you spending your time, money 
and energy for?
By faith Abraham left Ur of the Chaldeans when God called him. He 
did not leave until God told him to leave. Don’t ever leave a place unless 
God tells you to do so. When God called Abraham, he left his home and 
obeyed immediately (11:8). When Jesus called Peter, he obeyed immedi-
ately. If people had asked Abraham where he was going, he would have 
said, “I don’t know. But I know Who is leading me.” He lived by faith as 
a stranger in a foreign land, because he lived for heaven (11:9). By faith 
he and Sarah received the ability to have a child, when he was impotent 
and she was barren. Here we see the faith of both husband and wife. You 
are a blessed man if you get a wife like Sarah who also has a strong faith.
These people died in faith without receiving the promise (11:13). They 
never got all that God wanted to give man. They received only a little 
bit.  Abraham  got  a  son.  But  God  told  Abraham  that  all  the  families  
of  the  earth  would  be  blessed  through  him.  Did  he  see  that?  No.  He  
died in Canaan without ever seeing the fulfilment of that promise. But 
today it has been fulfilled. Some of us may never see the final result 
of our labours before we die. William Carey, the missionary to India, 
died  without  seeing  the  extent  to  which  his  translation  of  the  Bible  
into  Indian  languages  would  bless  India  and  the  people  around  the  
world who would be challenged by his life. Jim Elliot, the missionary 
to Ecuador died as a very young man, without seeing the many among 
the Auca tribe who would come to Christ and the many more around 
the  world  who  would  be  blessed  through  his  life.  If  you  live  by  faith  
and are faithful, your life will go on blessing people long after you are 
gone.  Abraham’s  life  showed  that  he  was  not  living  for  the  things  of  
this earth, but for the better country in heaven (11:16).
By  faith  Abraham  also  offered  up  Isaac,  when  God  asked  him  to  do  
that. God was testing Abraham to see if he would put his love for God 
above his love for Isaac. God had told Abraham that Isaac was the son 
through whom His promises would be fulfilled. What would happen to 
those  promises  if  Isaac  had  been  killed?  Abraham  believed  that  God  
would raise him from the dead and still fulfil His Word  (11:19).  What  
amazing faith Abraham had – to believe that Isaac would be raised from 

906 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
the  dead  –  when  such  a  thing  had  never  happened  in  human  history.  
God  makes  His  servants  do  things  at  times  that  others  cannot  under-
stand. When Elijah wanted to call down fire from heaven on the altar, he 
first asked the people to pour twelve buckets of water on it – water that 
would quench the fire. Thus he would prove that the fire when it came 
was from God Himself and not some cheap magician’s trick!
Then we read of the faith of Isaac. He blessed his children Jacob and 
Esau concerning future things. Later, Jacob also, blessed his children 
by faith (11:21). We too can bless our children by faith. We can bless 
our  children  concerning  their  future,  because  we  have  taught  them  
and led them in the ways of God. What a blessing we, as parents, can 
give to our children – just like Isaac and Jacob gave to their children!
We also read here that Jacob was “leaning upon his staff”. At Peniel, God 
had dislocated his thigh and broken his human strength and renamed 
him Israel. That staff on which Jacob leaned thereafter indicated how he 
was now a broken man, leaning on God alone for help. It’s wonderful to 
see this. In a chapter, where the many mighty accomplishments of men 
of faith are listed, we read of one man whose main accomplishment was 
that he leaned upon a staff! But that is actually one of the greatest mira-
cles that God does – when He breaks the soulish strength of a man and 
makes him lean in helpless dependence upon Him alone.
By faith Joseph prophesied that the Israelites would go back to Canaan, 
as God had promised, and would not stay in Egypt (11:22). We see another 
example of the faith of parents in 11:23 – Moses’ parents saw their child 
as a beautiful child and hid him, without being afraid of Pharaoh’s edict 
to  kill  all  male  babies.  We  too  as  parents  need  to  see  our  children  as  
beautiful children who can fulfil God’s purposes. Those parents had also 
put such faith into Moses’ heart when he was young, that when he grew 
up, he took three important decisions by faith. He refused the honour of 
this world (refusing to be known as Pharaoh’s daughter’s son). He refused 
the pleasures of sin. And he refused the wealth of this world (11:24–26). If 
you live by faith, these are three things you will also reject – this world’s 
honour, this world’s sinful pleasures and this world’s wealth. Instead of 
those, Moses chose the reproach of the Messiah (Christ) Who was going 
to come one day. And that reproach is what we will choose as well.
Then the writer goes on to mention some other wonderful things that 
men of faith accomplished – splitting the Red Sea and pulling down the 
walls of Jericho (11:29, 30). Notice here how we must have faith ourselves 
and not just imitate what others do: The Israelites went through the Red 
Sea by faith. But when the Egyptians imitated them, they drowned (11:29)! 
Rahab the harlot, had faith that the God of Israel would protect her, even 
though she was a Canaanite. So she protected the Israelite spies, risking 
her  life  to  do  so.  And  God  honoured  her  faith.  At  times,  we  too  may

have to take risks in our walk of faith. Then the writer mentions Gideon, 
Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David and Samuel the prophet – who by faith 
conquered kingdoms, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of 
fire, escaped the edge of the sword, put armies to flight; and some women 
even received their dead children back to life by faith (11:31–35).
However, all these are just one side of faith – faith to accomplish amazing 
miracles.  But  there  is  another  side  too.  There  were  men  and  women  
who  had  equal  faith  who  never  experienced  any  such  things.  Some  
of them who refused to deny their faith were tortured and killed and 
will get their reward only when Christ returns. Some other men and 
women of faith experienced mockings, scourgings, chains and impris-
onment. Some men of faith were stoned and some were sawn in two. 
(Tradition says that it was Isaiah who was sawn in two.) Some other 
men of faith were put to death, some wandered about in sheepskins 
and goatskins, destitute and afflicted and ill treated. They wandered 
about in deserts and mountains and caves and in holes in the ground. 
All  of  these  were  equally  men  of  faith  as  the  ones  mentioned  earlier  
who experienced miraculous deliverances. Even today, God’s plans for 
His children are different. He allows some to accomplish great things 
and  to  experience  miracles  by  faith,  while  He  permits  others  to  be  
imprisoned and tortured for their faith. Carnal believers will value the 
former over the latter. But God sees them all as people of whom this 
world is not worthy. They are all too good for this world.
So we see that faith is not always manifested in splitting seas and shut-
ting the mouths of the lions. At times, it is seen in standing true to God 
and proclaiming that Jesus Christ alone is Lord, even when lions come to 
kill us and eat us up or when they come to behead us. That too is faith. 
Both manifestations of faith are mentioned together here in Chapter 11. 
We leave it to God to decide which of these paths He has planned for us.
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego went into the fire and came out 
untouched  by  it.  Many  of  the  early  Christians  however  were  burnt  to  
death by their persecutors. Daniel went into the lion’s den and came out 
untouched. The early Christians however were thrown to the lions and 
the lions ate them up. Who had more faith? Both had equal faith – one to 
escape death and the other in being faithful unto death. It is for God to 
decide whether the lion should eat us up or spare us, whether we should 
be beheaded or escape. The early Christians left it to God to decide that 
for them. James was beheaded, but Peter escaped (Acts 12). Both men 
had equal faith. But God’s will was different for each of them.
Chapter 11 concludes by saying that under the old covenant, both these 
groups of men of faith (the ones who triumphed and the ones who endured) 
got God’s approval through faith. But it then goes on to say that God has 
provided something better for us now in the new covenant – something

Hebrews
far superior to anything that these men listed here in Chapter 11 experi-
enced. This word ‘better’ occurs many times in Hebrews. 
Following Jesus – Our Example
Today, our faith is not looking up to Abel, Moses, Enoch or any of the 
men listed in Chapter 11. Our faith is “looking away from everyone else 
unto Jesus” (12:2), because He is the Author and Finisher of our faith. We 
look up to Him and run this race. We don’t stand still. The race of faith 
is something in which you can’t stand still. The time is short and so you 
have  to  run.  If  you  fall  down,  get  up  and  continue  running.  There  are  
many runners who have fallen down in a race, who got up, continued to 
run and still came first. So don’t get discouraged if you fall down some-
times in your walk with the Lord. Don’t lie there. Get up, confess your sin 
and continue to run.
Look at Jesus who endured the cross and ran till the end of His life. 
When  many  enemies  oppose  you  consider  Him  who  had  so  many  
enemies opposing Him (12:3). You have not yet resisted to the point of 
shedding blood like He did, in striving against sin (12:4). Here we see 
that Jesus strove against sin. In other words, His attitude toward sin 
was, “I would rather shed My blood than commit sin.” If you have the 
same attitude – that you would rather die than commit sin – you too 
will  be  an  overcomer.  When  you  are  tempted  to  tell  a  lie,  if  you  say,  
“I  would  rather  die  than  tell  a  lie”,  you  will  be  an  overcomer.  When  
you are tempted to cheat a little bit to make more money, if you say, 
“I would rather die than cheat even a little”, you will be an overcomer. 
When you are tempted to lust after some pretty woman and you say, 
“I  would  rather  die  than  lust”,  you  will  be  an  overcomer.  That  is  the  
secret of living the overcoming life.
The writer then speaks about the matter of God disciplining us to make 
us holy. We look unto Jesus as our Example; and we look unto our Father 
Who disciplines us. God disciplines us as a Father for our good. If we do 
not experience any discipline from God that would prove that we are not 
really His children. We may not feel happy while being disciplined, but we 
will see later on that it produces holiness in us. (12:4–11).
In 12:14, we are told to “pursue peace with all men and sanctification”, 
without  which  we  will  not  see  the  Lord.  It  is  vital  that  as  Christians  
we are known as men of peace who do not like to fight or quarrel with 
anyone for anything.
Then  we  are  exhorted  in  12:16,  not  to  be  foolish  like  Esau,  who  for  
a little bit of earthly profit lost his spiritual birthright. Don’t lose your 
eternal  inheritance  by  compromising  your  convictions,  for  the  sake  of  
some earthly gain. Esau regretted his action and wept and begged for the

Hebrews
birthright later on, but could not get back what he had given away. In the 
same way, at the judgement seat of Christ, many will pray with tears as 
they look back at the foolish choices they made and their wasted life. But 
they cannot live their life again. So be wise now.
In 12:18–23,  the  writer  says  that  we  have  not  come  to  Mount  Sinai,  
where the law was given, but to Mount Zion (the church). So we do not 
have to live in fear and trembling as Moses and the Israelites did.
In 12:24, the blood of Jesus is contrasted with the blood of Abel. The 
blood  of  Abel  cried  for  judgement,  the  blood  of  Jesus  cries  for  mercy.  
When somebody harms you like Cain harmed Abel, you will either pray 
for  judgement  on  that  person  or  mercy.  That  depends  on  whether  you  
are under the old covenant or new covenant. If you follow the old cove-
nant and somebody harms you, you will cry out for judgement like Abel 
did  and  say,  “Lord,  punish  that  man”  –  just  as  David  and  some  of  the  
other authors of the psalms prayed. But if you follow Jesus you will cry 
out for mercy and pray, “Lord, forgive him for he does not know what he 
is doing.”
In 12:25–29,  we  read  about  the  kingdom  that  God  is  building  –  the  
church – the only thing that will remain forever. Everything else will be 
shaken and destroyed. People who have put their confidence in money, 
gold, real estate, property or anything on this earth will find their lives 
shaken. You can have property, but don’t let your trust be in that. Let 
your confidence be in God alone. Then we will serve Him with thank-
fulness. The writer reminds us that our God is a consuming fire. So we 
must  serve  Him  not  with  the  fear  the  Israelites  had  at  Sinai,  but  with  
reverence and godly fear – as Jesus had (Hebrews 5:7).
In Chapter 13, the writer concludes with some closing exhortations.
“Love  the  brothers.  Show  hospitality  to  anyone  who  comes  to  your  
house.  Remember  those  who  are  suffering  and  Christians  who  are  
being ill-treated and in prison. Suffer with them and encourage them. 
Keep  your  marriage  perfectly  pure.  Don’t  ever  have  sex  outside  of  
marriage, because God will judge all such people” (13:1–4).
Be content and perfectly satisfied with whatever God has given you 
(13:5).  Don’t  run  after  money  because  God  has  said  that  he  will  never  
leave  you  nor  forsake  you.  That  promise  is  like  having  a  large  balance  
in  your  bank  account.  God  Himself  will  always  be  with  you.  Isn’t  that  
enough? Don’t look at what others have and desire those things. Do you 
think  a  better  house,  more  clothes,  a  fancy  car  and  many  gadgets  will  
bring you happiness? No. Be satisfied with what you have. It is enough 
to hear the Lord say, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” For then 
you can boldly say in every situation, “The Lord is my Helper. I will not be 
afraid. What can any man do to me” (13:6). Then we will live without fear 
of any person or any circumstance.

910 Through the Bible: Jesus – The Mediator of a Better Covenant 
Hebrews
In 13:7 we are commanded to observe the life of older godly men who 
have led us and to see the good results that come from their lives – and 
to follow their example. Since “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today 
and forever”, He Who led them and blessed them can lead you and bless 
you as well. What He did for them, He can do for you. The writer warns 
us not to be occupied with strange doctrines that have not brought godli-
ness  to  those  who  preach  them.  The  right  doctrine  is  that  which  will  
“strengthen your heart with grace” so that you do not sin (13:9). There are 
many  strange  doctrines  being  preached  today.  So  we  must  be  careful.  
Always find out whether these doctrines have made the people preaching 
them more Christlike. If not, leave them alone.
Following Jesus will always involve, in every generation “going outside 
the camp (both of the world and of religious (but unspiritual) Christians) 
and bearing the reproach of Christ” (13:10–13).
Let us learn to offer a sacrifice of praise to God at all times (13:15).
In 13:17,  we  are  commanded  to  obey  our  church-leaders.  We  must  
respect,  value  and  submit  to  those  who  have  been  placed  by  God  in  
spiritual  authority  over  us.  The  writer  assumes  that  all  believers  will  
have  some  such  spiritual  authority  over  them  as  their  leaders.  Those  
leaders have to give an account to God one day about you. Did you know 
that your elders will be giving an account to God for you and for everyone 
under their charge? Elder brothers also need to take this verse seriously 
and recognise this responsibility they have for their flock.
The concluding blessing in the letter is:
“Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd 
of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus our 
Lord,  equip  you  in  every  good  thing  to  do  His  will,  working  in  us  that  
which  is  pleasing  in  His  sight,  through  Jesus  Christ,  to  whom  be  the  
glory forever and ever. Amen” (13:20, 21).

JAMES
True Faith Will Produce  
Good Works
T
he letter of James was probably the first among the books of the 
New  Testament  to  be  written.  It  was  probably  around  16  or  17  
years after the day of Pentecost. This was written before any of the 
gospels were written.
If this is the first book of the New Testament it is interesting to see 
how James emphasises that true faith will produce works. “Salvation is 
by faith and not by works of the law” was a new message that the Jewish 
Christians were hearing – and it was much misunderstood then, even as 
it is misunderstood today. They thought that faith was intellectual and 
it no longer mattered how they lived so long as they “believed” in Jesus! 
So James wrote his letter to correct that error. This is why this letter 
has special relevance for many Christians who have fallen into the same 
error today.
In Chapter 1, James speaks about faith giving us victory over tempta-
tion, so that we do not sin. In Chapter 2, he speaks about faith producing 
love for all men so that we are not partial towards the rich or the mighty 
in the church. In Chapter 3 he says that faith will make us control our 
speech. And in Chapters 4 and 5, James says that faith will separate us 
from the spirit of the world and bring purity and patience into our lives.
James’ main burden is to teach that true faith will always produce the 
works of faith. Otherwise what you call “faith” is a counterfeit. Faith is 
like money – there is the real and the counterfeit. If you have worked 
hard and were paid for it in a lot of 1000-rupee currency notes, you 
can think you are rich. But when you go to the bank to deposit that 
money and are told by them that all those notes are counterfeit, you 
realise that you were cheated. It can be like that with your faith too. 

912 Through the Bible: True Faith Will Produce Good Works 
James
A counterfeit faith can send you to hell. That is why it is very important 
to  check  your  faith.  The  letter  of  James  will  give  you  a  good  scan  to  
check whether your faith is real or not.
He  begins  by  saying,  “Consider  it  all  joy  when  you  encounter  various  
types of trials” (1:2). If your faith is genuine, you will rejoice when you 
face trials – for that is like putting the 1000-rupee note under the scanner 
to check whether it is real or not. Why should you be afraid of that? If 
your faith is counterfeit isn’t it better to know now rather than at Christ’s 
judgement-seat? So it is good that God brings you into some trial now 
so that you can know for certain whether your faith is genuine or not. 
So rejoice!
If you are building a house, wouldn’t it be better if an earthquake came 
while you were still laying the foundation and not after you completed the 
house? If the foundation is shaky, you can rectify it immediately. Even 
so, it is good to go through trials, at the very beginning of your Christian 
life. You  may  say,  “I  trust  in  the  Lord.”  But  when  you  get  into  a  little  
financial difficulty, you start worrying and complaining. Maybe you are 
sick and you start questioning God. Or perhaps you get some opposition 
from  men  and  you  get  discouraged  and  lose  your  faith.  All  these  trials  
would prove to you that your faith was not really genuine.
Further,  trials  also  produce  the  virtue  of  patience  in  us.  We  saw  in  
Hebrews  that  faith  and  patience  go  together.  They  are  like  the  two  
legs we stand on. We always need patience (endurance) along with our 
faith. If we allow this endurance to complete its work in us, it will make 
us  perfect  and  complete,  lacking  in  nothing  (1:4).  Consider  this  goal  
– “perfect and complete, lacking in nothing”. Do you want to get there? 
The way there is through trial. There is no other way to get there. 
We haven’t got there yet, and so we need to go through many more 
trials. If I have acquired any spiritual value in my life, it is through the 
trials that the Lord has taken me through. But I have to go through 
many  more  trials  to  reach  that  goal  of  ‘perfect,  complete,  lacking  in  
nothing.’ That is God’s goal for all of us. Don’t get discouraged if you 
discover  through  some  trial  that  your  faith  was  not  genuine.  Thank  
God for showing it to you, and ask Him to give you genuine faith. God 
will give it to you.
In dealing with our trials, what we need most of all is wisdom. So we 
should ask God for it. Maybe someone is treating you badly. You need 
wisdom  to  know  how  to  respond  to  him  in  a  godly  way.  Perhaps  the  
enemies of the gospel are troubling you. You need wisdom there. Ask for 
it. And here is an encouraging word: “God will not scold you” for asking 
(1:5 - LB). Our parents and teachers may have scolded us many times 
when we failed. But God never scolds. He corrects us, but He will never 

Temptation and Sin                                                                                                                                   913
James
scold  us.  That  is  a  great  encouragement  to  know.  A  godly  father  will  
correct his children, but he will not scold them. We scold people whom 
we look down on. We consider him stupid or dull for bungling up things. 
But God never despises anyone. He will say, “What you did is wrong, my 
son. But I will teach you and give you wisdom so that you can do it right 
next time.” That is God’s way – always gentle and gracious.
So, the next time you don’t have wisdom for some situation, go to God 
and ask Him for it. He will give it to you. But there is one condition. You 
have to ask in faith. Here is my definition of faith: “Faith is believing that 
God is more eager to give me what He has promised than I am to receive 
it”. So, believe that God is eager to give you wisdom. 
If you don’t ask in faith, then James says that you are like the waves of 
the sea that are tossed here and there. Have you seen on a beach how the 
waves come into the beach and then go right back and come back again? 
A man without faith is like that. He trusts in the Lord one moment and 
then loses his faith the next moment. If you ask God and then imagine, 
“Yes,  He  will  give  me  wisdom.  No,  He  won’t  give  me  wisdom”  –  and  so  
on, back and forth, then you won’t get it. Here is what the Word of God 
promises to those who don’t have faith: “He will receive nothing from the 
Lord” (1:7). He won’t get forgiveness, or the baptism in the Holy Spirit, or 
answers to prayer, or godliness, or any of God’s spiritual riches. James 
says that such a man is an unstable, double-minded man.
James then goes on to speak about a poor brother who has faith. His 
faith will enable him to rejoice in “his high position in Christ”, even if 
he has very little of this world’s goods (1:9). He will not envy the rich 
believers around him, neither will he want any sympathy from any of 
them. He knows that he is a son of the King and that his real wealth 
is in heaven. And so he has a dignity about him. That is how a poor 
brother with genuine faith will think.
In the same way, a rich brother with faith will look at all his property 
and money and say, “All of this will pass away like the grass” (1:10). One 
day it is there but the next day it is gone. If a rich person lives for his 
earthly wealth, then he himself will fade away along with all his wealth 
one day. But if he does not live for his earthly wealth but for the kingdom 
of God, then when his earthly wealth fades away, he himself will remain.
Temptation and Sin
Then James talks about temptation and sin. The earlier trials he spoke 
about  were  difficulties  in  our  life.  Now  he  talks  about  the  temptation 
to  sin.  He  says  that  if  you  keep  on  overcoming  in  temptation,  you  will  
receive  a  crown  of  life  from  God  one  day.  God  promises  that  to  all  who  
love  Him. That teaches us that if we love the Lord we will fight against 

914 Through the Bible: True Faith Will Produce Good Works 
James
all temptations to sin. When a temptation comes to you, don’t ask, “God, 
why did You send this temptation to me?” God never sent it. God doesn’t 
tempt  anyone.  “Let  no  one  say  when  he  is  tempted  that  God  is  tempting  
him. God doesn’t tempt anyone.” (1:13). Who then is tempting you? It is 
Satan through the desires in your flesh. Because we have all indulged in 
the desires of our flesh for so many years from our childhood, Satan can 
use those desires to tempt us. When a country is at war, the enemy sends 
their agents secretly inside the country to cause destruction from within. 
The enemy fights on two fronts – at the battle front and also from within 
the country through its agents. So it is with Satan too. We must identify 
Satan’s agents within us – the ungodly desires in our flesh, which are on 
the side of Satan – and put them to death. If you slay the agents of the 
enemy within, you will be strong to fight against Satan on the battle-front.
It is only when you allow your mind to agree with a wrong desire that 
you  sin.  Until  then  the  thought  that  comes  to  your  mind  is  only  a  
temptation. For example, as you are walking down the road, you see 
something that tempts you. That’s not a sin. That is temptation. But 
when you look again at it, then you sin. The first look is temptation, 
the second look is sin. We cannot avoid the first look because we are 
living  in  a  world  which  has  so  much  evil  all  around  us.  But  we  can  
decide whether we agree with that evil or not.
It is similar to how a baby is conceived – which is the example used 
by the Holy Spirit here. When your mind agrees with the wrong desire 
in your flesh, it is like a woman agreeing to give her body to a man for 
sexual union. Then a conception takes place. But if the woman refuses to 
give herself to the man, there is no conception. Even so, if you reject the 
temptation and do not allow your mind to agree with the wrong desire, 
then there is no sin.
Someone has said, “You cannot prevent the birds from flying over your 
head,  but  you  can  stop  them  from  making  a  nest  in  your  hair.”  The  
birds flying over your head are the temptations – many bad thoughts 
that come into your mind. Those are not sin, if you reject them imme-
diately. Those are temptations. But if you choose to enjoy those bad 
thoughts  for  even  a  few  seconds,  then  you  have  allowed  the  “birds” 
to  start  making  a  nest  in  your  mind.  Then  you  have  sinned.  Satan  
tempted Jesus also by putting thoughts into His mind in the wilder-
ness. But Jesus rejected them every time – and so He did not sin.
So don’t get discouraged because thoughts keep coming into your mind. 
They  are  only  temptations.  It  is  only  when  you  enjoy  those  thoughts  
and accept them, that they become sin. This is very liberating for us to 
know that only when a conception takes place sin is born. If there is no 

Temptation and Sin                                                                                                                                   915
James
conception, there is no baby. The final result of sin is spiritual death 
(1:15), and we should not be deceived about this (1:16).
In  the  next  verse,  we  are  reminded  that  “every  good  and  perfect  gift  
comes only from above – from our heavenly Father” (1:17). So victory over 
temptation can never come from within ourselves. It has to come from 
above  –  by  help  that  comes  from  our  Father  through  the  Holy  Spirit.  
We have to ask God for grace to overcome.
Whatever God gives is perfect, for He never changes. God brought us 
into the world so that we might be an example (‘first fruits’) in the midst 
of His creation. Since this is God’s will for us, He will certainly help us to 
overcome temptation, so that we can be an example to all of His creation. 
So never imagine that God won’t help you to overcome sin. He certainly 
will. You are the first fruits of His creation. You are to be an example to 
all of creation. God will certainly help you.
Then  James  talks  about  our  speech.  “Let  everyone  be  quick  to  hear,  
slow to speak and slow to anger” (1:19). Most human beings are the 
opposite of that: Slow to hear, quick to speak and quick to anger. Here 
in this verse is a first step to overcoming anger: When people are speak-
ing, learn to listen to them patiently first. Don’t interrupt them. Then 
after they have finished, give them your opinion. When we are slow to 
speak, we will be slow to anger too. Try this prescription for freedom 
from anger! 
James goes on to say that we cannot expect to fulfil God’s purposes by 
getting angry. Anger can never achieve the righteousness of God. It is a 
concern for God’s glory that will accomplish God’s righteousness.
In 1:21, we are exhorted to “put aside all filthiness and all that remains 
of wickedness.” Even after we have put away all filthiness, there will still 
be some wickedness remaining at the bottom. After you have drunk your 
cup of coffee and you turn the cup upside down into the sink, if you look 
inside, there will still be some stains of coffee in the cup. Sin is like that. 
You  may  imagine  that  you  have  confessed  everything.  But  as  you  get  
closer to the Lord, you will discover that there is more sin within that you 
did not notice earlier. Don’t be too quick to say that you have finished 
confessing every sin. Ask God to show you. Then, “in humility acknowl-
edge what God says and it will save your soul” (1:21).
When we hear God speak to us, we must obey immediately. Otherwise, 
James  says  you  will  be  like  someone  who  saw  dirt  on  his  face  in  the  
mirror  but  did  not  wash  it  away.  God’s  word  is  a  mirror  which  shows  
us the condition of our heart. Don’t go away forgetting what you read in 
God’s Word or what you heard in the meeting. We could say that God’s 
Word is like an X-ray or scan, that shows us our true inner state. And 
when God shows you something, set it right at once. God’s word is a law 
of liberty that can set us free (1:25).

916 Through the Bible: True Faith Will Produce Good Works 
James
Then the Holy Spirit gives a very challenging word by which everyone 
who imagines himself to be spiritual should evaluate himself. “If anyone 
thinks that he is a godly man and cannot control his tongue he is deceiving 
himself”  (1:26). Remember  that  verse  all  your  life.  If  you  cannot  control  
your tongue, your Christianity is worth zero. All your work for the Lord is 
worth zero if you cannot control your tongue.
It is very important that we control our tongue if we claim to be believ-
ers. Most believers have a very bad testimony because they cannot control 
their tongue. Even when they say something beneficial to someone, they 
say it in a very hard way. You may have a tendency to point out a fault 
in a person as soon as you see it. I have noticed at times, that if I made 
a  small  factual mistake  in  a  message,  someone  will  come  to  me  at  the  
end of the meeting and tell me about that one thing that was factually 
incorrect. He will not say one word about any blessing he got from the 
message. That is the nature of Adam. He found something wrong in his 
wife as soon as he lost his fellowship with God. Adam’s nature tends to 
find fault rather than to appreciate. If you don’t allow the Holy Spirit to 
change this nature, your usefulness to God will also become zero. Ask 
the Holy Spirit to help you to control your tongue.
1:27  tells  us  that  true  Christianity  is  not  just  a  matter  of  attending  
meetings and studying the Bible. It is intensely practical. It is caring for 
those  who  are  in  need,  such  as  orphans  and  widows  in  the  church.  If  
a widow or an orphan is rich, you don’t have to worry about them. But 
caring for the poor and the helpless is a major part of true Christianity. 
A true servant of God will seek to serve the poor more than the rich. He 
will  visit  poor  churches  more  than  rich  churches.  He  will  go  to  village  
churches more than city churches. He will visit people who cannot afford 
to  give  him  a  gift  and  not  people  who  give  him  money.  He  will  fellow-
ship with poor brothers rather than with rich brothers. He will seek for 
fellowship with the poor and the lowly rather than with the great and the 
mighty. But do we see that in Christian workers today? It is extremely 
rare. There are very few true servants of the Lord today. But you yourself 
can be one like that. Decide that you will concentrate on serving those 
who  are  weak  and  poor  in  the  church.  At  the  same  time  keep  yourself  
completely “unspotted and unstained by the world”. This is the essence 
of true Christianity.
The Sin of Partiality
In 2:1,  James  goes  on  to  speak  about  showing  partiality  to  the  rich.  
This is a major problem in almost all churches today. Because a pastor 
needs financial support from his congregation, he ends up pleasing the 
rich people therein, so that he can get their money for his salary. Such 
a pastor is an evil person (2:4) – and therefore unfit to lead any church. 
One who despises the poor is just like any worldly person who also treats 

The Sin of Partiality                                                                                                                                  917
James
only  the  rich  people  with  favour.  In  my  younger  days  when  I  visited  
different  churches  (of  all  denominations),  I  saw  that  the  rich  and  the  
influential people were always the Board-members of the church. This 
was not because they were spiritual, but because they had high positions 
in society. They were given honour in the church, just as written here: 
“Please come and sit here – on our Board as a member!” And they tell the 
poor man, “You can’t sit on the Board as a member, because you don’t 
have either influence or money. You may be spiritual, but we don’t care 
for that” (2:2, 3). What type of “churches” can such pastors build? Only 
worldly  clubs!  Certainly  not  the  church  of  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  with  
Whom there is no partiality and Who was the Friend of the poor.
God  has  chosen  poor  people  to  be  rich  in  faith  and  promised  His  
kingdom to them (2:5). It is a shame when any church dishonours poor 
people. Rich people who sit on the Board are the ones who get offended 
easily  and  then  drag  the  church  to  court.  Only  rich  people  can  drag  
others  to  court,  because  they  alone  have  the  money  to  do  that.  Poor  
people don’t have the money to pay lawyers. It is the rich who blaspheme 
the Name of Jesus (2:6, 7).
If you love others as yourself, as the Scripture commands, you can never 
show partiality to anyone (2:8). Those who show partiality anywhere – 
to their children at home or to people in the church – are committing a 
serious sin. You cannot compensate for that by living in purity in other 
areas (2:11). You are still a sinner, because partiality is as much a sin 
as adultery and murder –but not recognised as such by most believers. 
What would you think of a believer who commits murder and adultery? 
A believer who shows partiality to the rich is in the same category.
In 2:12, 13, the Holy Spirit warns us against another equally serious 
sin – unmercifully judging others. Those who are merciless to others (for 
any reason) will find that God will show them no mercy when He judges 
them in the final day. When people hurt us, if we are believers, we will 
hear two voices rising within us, “Judge him,” and “Be merciful to him.” 
Which voice will win? The voice of mercy must always win over the voice 
of judgement.
In 2:14–26, we are told that genuine faith will always produce a helping 
attitude  towards  people  who  are  in  physical  need.  If  you  see  a  brother  
who is in need of food or clothes and you don’t help him, your faith is 
useless. Note that he is not talking about buying that poor brother a car 
or a scooter. He is only talking about food and clothing – the necessities 
of life. We don’t have to help a brother to live in luxury. But if a brother is 
shivering in the cold, or his house is leaking and he can’t sleep properly 
at night, it is no use saying, “Praise the Lord, brother. We will pray for 
you”. There is no need to pray there. Just get him a blanket and give him 
some money to fix his roof. That is true Christianity. It is no use saying 
you have faith if you don’t have works to back it up.

918 Through the Bible: True Faith Will Produce Good Works 
James
Abraham had faith, but he proved it by offering up his son (2:21). His 
faith was proved by his works. If you have faith and it doesn’t produce 
any works, such faith is not genuine faith.
2:26  we  could  say  is  the  central  verse  of  the  epistle:  “For  just  as  the  
body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.” The 
parts of the human body can be compared to correct doctrine and faith 
to the breath in the body. Believing the right doctrines without the works 
of faith brings spiritual death.
The Tongue is a Fire
Chapter 3 is the great chapter in the Bible about the use of the tongue. 
The book of Proverbs also speaks a lot about being wise in our speech. 
On the day of Pentecost it was a tongue of fire that came upon people. 
Unfortunately, carefulness in our speech is not sufficiently emphasised 
in Christendom. If you are serious about serving God, you must take 
the  matter  of  controlling  your  tongue  very  seriously.  Failure  in  this  
area  is  one  of  the  main  reasons  why  many  preachers  don’t  have  the  
word of God when they speak. If you want to be a spokesman for God, 
you must first of all, “remove  all  the  worthless  from  the  precious”  in  
your ordinary day-to-day conversation (Jeremiah 15:19). If you speak 
idle  words  in  your  ordinary  conversation,  you  cannot  expect  God  to  
speak through you when you stand in the pulpit. A second reason is 
unfaithfulness  with  money.  God  does  not  give  true  riches  from  His  
Word to preachers who are unfaithful with money (Luke 16:11).
The tongue is like the bit that is put into a horse’s mouth with which 
the  horse  can  be  controlled  and  turned  in  any  direction  (3:3).  Horses  
that  don’t  have  a  bit  in  their  mouth  will  run  wild  –  and  such  horses  
accomplish nothing. Horses that win prizes in races are those that allow 
themselves to be controlled by the bits in their mouths. If you want to 
accomplish something with your life for God let Him put a bit and a bridle 
in your mouth. Tell the Lord that you want Him to control your speech 
totally.
The tongue is also compared to the rudder of a ship (3:4). The rudder 
is a small steel-plate at the rear-end of every boat and ship. When you 
turn  the  rudder  one  way  the  ship  turns  in  the  same  direction.  It  is  a  
small piece at the back of the ship that turns a huge ship in the direction 
it should go. Your tongue is the test of your spirituality – and not your 
activity or your Bible-knowledge. Show me the way you use your tongue 
and I will tell you whether you are a spiritual person or not.
James uses all these examples to show us the importance of the tongue. 
It’s only a small part of the body, but what a fire it can start (3:5)! Many 
believers’ tongues are set on fire with the fire of hell (3:6).

The Tongue is a Fire                                                                                                                                  919
James
“Nobody can tame the tongue” (3:7, 8). In a circus, even lions and tigers 
are tamed – and some men even put their heads inside the lion’s mouth 
– and the lion doesn’t bite them off. But no-one can tame the tongue. 
What is the solution for this problem? We must ask the Holy Spirit to 
tame it in us. That was why when the Holy Spirit fell upon people on the 
day of Pentecost, a tongue of fire rested on their heads. The Holy Spirit 
was saying thereby, “I want to control your tongue with the fire of God 
from  now  on.”  Many  Christians  haven’t  understood  this.  It’s  a  great  
tragedy that many who preach the baptism in the Holy Spirit today are 
more eager to get people speak in other tongues than to lead them to 
speak graciously at all times in their mother tongue. This is what has 
resulted in many counterfeits among those who “speak in tongues”.
The  Holy  Spirit  has  given  me  the  gift  of  speaking  in  an  unknown  
language to my heavenly Father, and I praise Him for that. But above all, 
He enabled me to control my mother tongue – and I praise Him even more 
for this. This is how we can know whether we received the Holy Spirit or 
some other false spirit. Apply this test to yourself: “Can you control your 
mother  tongue?”  If  not,  reject  every  other  spirit  you  have  received  and  
seek God again to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Tell God that you want to 
have the power to speak graciously at all times. Only the Holy Spirit can 
tame the tongue. How can you bless God in the church-meeting and then 
curse men afterwards (3:9)?
In 3:13, James says, “If you are a wise man show your wisdom by the 
gentleness of your actions.” Wise men are gentle in the way they commu-
nicate their wisdom. There are two things that will never be found in a 
wise man: bitter jealousy and selfish ambition (3:14). If you are jealous of 
others you are not wise, no matter how much Bible-knowledge you may 
have. If you have selfish ambition and want to show that you are better 
than others, that you can pray better than others, or preach better than 
others, or that your church is better than that of others, or that you are 
accomplishing more than others, then you are earthly-minded, soulish 
and  demonic  (3:15).  Then  James  repeats  the  twin  dangers  of  jealousy  
and selfish ambition a second time (3:16). There is a lot of jealousy and 
selfish ambition in Christendom. When God blesses someone’s ministry, 
others  can  become  jealous  of  him  and  then  criticise  him.  Such  people  
are influenced by demons. A spiritually-minded person will rejoice even 
when  someone  much  younger  than  him  has  a  more  spiritual  ministry  
than he has. He will praise the Lord for that and never be jealous.
Selfish ambition will prevent you from appreciating what others are 
doing  for  the  Lord.  Paul  could  rejoice  even  when  some  people  were  
serving  the  Lord  with  wrong  motives  (Philippians  1:15–18).  We  don’t  
have to judge people when they disagree with us. God is the Judge of 
all men – and He waits until people die before He judges them (Hebrews 
9:27). So let us leave all judgement to God. We can disagree with the 

920 Through the Bible: True Faith Will Produce Good Works 
James
wrong  doctrines  people  preach  and  the  un-Christlike  methods  they  
use – and even expose those errors. But we must never judge people. 
Before  you  criticise  someone  for  serving  the  Lord  poorly,  you  should  
ask yourself what you are doing for the Lord yourself.
Proverbs 9:1 speaks of the seven pillars of wisdom. Those pillars are 
listed  here  (in  3:17): Purity,  peaceableness,  gentleness,  being  reason-
able, being full of mercy, being unwavering (without partiality) and being 
without  hypocrisy.  These  are  qualities  worth  meditating  on.  Where  we  
lack any of these, we are urged in 1:5 to pray and ask God for them and 
we are promised that God will give us these qualities liberally.
Friendship With the World
In 4:4, James says that friendship with the world makes you the enemy 
of God. One who loves this world is an adulteress, because he is unfaith-
ful  to  his  marriage  vows  to  Jesus  Christ  his  Bridegroom.  That  is  how  
serious a matter love for this world is. This world’s principles and its way 
of life are totally different from God’s. So if you align yourself with this 
world  you  automatically  become  an  enemy  of  God.  Friendship  of  this  
world doesn’t mean you can’t have friends in the world. He is talking here 
about the world-system, the principles by which this world operates. If 
you are a disciple of Jesus, you will reject this world’s sense of values and 
live by God’s sense of values.
In 4:5, James goes on to say, “God jealously desires the spirit which He 
has placed within us.” The spirit is the deepest part of man, where God 
dwells in a Christian. Just like a husband has a pure jealousy that his 
wife should belong exclusively to him, God also is jealous that no-one 
else should have any influence over our spirit. The Holy Spirit jealously 
desires that our spirit be devoted to Jesus alone. He doesn’t want it to 
be polluted with this world-system.
If we are humble, God will give us grace to keep ourselves unspotted 
by the world (4:6). God fights against those who are proud but supports 
the humble. If you remain in humility, God will always support you. But 
if  you  are  proud,  God  will  always  resist  you.  In  other  words,  if  we  are  
proud, God will keep on pushing us back. The devil is already pushing 
us back. The lusts in our flesh are also pushing us back. On top of that, 
if  God  also  starts  pushing  us  back,  we  will  have  no  hope  at  all.  But  if  
we are humble even though the devil and our lusts are against us, God 
will keep pushing us forward. That is why the humble alone can make 
spiritual progress. I often say that the three secrets of the Christian life 
are  “Humility,  humility,  humility”!  Beware  when  thoughts  of  pride  and  
self-congratulation enter your mind because of what you are, what you

James
know, or what you have accomplished. Give God the glory and credit for 
it all. Otherwise God will begin to resist you. Humble yourself at all times 
and say, “Lord, I am what I am by Your grace alone.”
If we submit to God totally first and then resist the devil, he will always 
flee from us. This is God’s promise (4:7). But if you try to resist Satan 
without submitting totally to God, you will find that nothing happens. 
If we draw near to God, He will always draw near to us (4:8).
Practical Exhortations
James then gives us a number of practical exhortations. “Humble your-
self in the presence of the Lord” (4:10). “Don’t speak against or judge your 
brothers” (4:11). Don’t boast that you will do this, that or the other tomor-
row. Remember that your life is in God’s hands and if God permits you 
to go somewhere or to do something, give Him the credit for it (4:13–17).
Then James speaks to the rich people in the church. He warns them 
not  to  trust  in  their  wealth  and  to  ensure  that  they  always  pay  their  
employees properly. Don’t make money by paying your workers less than 
they deserve to be paid (5:1–4). I have come across many believers who 
praise God and preach loudly in the Sunday meetings , but who do not 
pay their servants properly at home. I can find out whether you are a man 
of faith by the salary you pay your servants at home. If you are stingy 
and  miserly,  and  you  never  get  new  clothes  for  that  poor  person  who  
works for you at home, then your shouts of “Hallelujah” in the meeting 
are empty. God says, “Keep quiet and go and do something good for that 
poor  person  who  works  for  you.”  If  you  are  stingy  and  miserly  in  your  
payment of your servants, your faith is worth nothing. If you don’t pay 
your servants properly and therefore you have some more money in your 
bank, there will be a curse on that money. It will consume your flesh one 
day (5:3). The cry of your poor servants has gone up to God and He has 
heard  their  cry  saying,  “O  God,  see  how  this  child  of  yours  treats  me.  
He doesn’t pay me properly.” 
Then James speaks to the ones who are suffering. He encourages them 
to wait patiently for the coming of the Lord, like a farmer waits for the 
harvest (5:7). By patience we can strengthen our hearts (5:8). And then 
he speaks to all believers saying that we should never have a complaint 
against  one  another,  for  God  will  judge  those  who  complain  (5:9). 
Very, very few believers have taken this warning seriously.
When we are suffering, we should look at the example of all the Biblical 
prophets  who  suffered  patiently  (5:10).  Then  James  reminds  us  of  the  
example  of  Job  (5:11).  What  a  lot  he  suffered!  And  then  see  how  the  
Lord blessed him finally. The Lord is full of compassion. If you have to 
go  through  a  lot  of  suffering  because  other  people  treat  you  badly  or  

922 Through the Bible: True Faith Will Produce Good Works 
James
suppress you or take advantage of you, because you are poor, leave your 
case  in  God’s  hands.  As  Job  said,  “He  knows  every  details  of  what  is  
happening to me” (Job 23:10 - Living). Remain faithful to the Lord. The 
Lord will return and deal with all who are troubling you and bless you 
doubly, as He did for Job. We can see that James had a great concern 
and compassion for poor Christians.
Then James gives a few closing instructions. Always speak the truth 
(5:12). If you are suffering, pray. If you are cheerful, sing praises to the 
Lord (5:13). If you are sick, call for the elders of the church to come home 
and pray for you. Let them take a little oil (a symbol of the Holy Spirit) 
and anoint you and pray something like this, “Lord Jesus, this body is 
the temple of your Holy Spirit. Preserve Your temple in good health. Give 
him a taste of Your resurrection power in his body. Amen.” The prayer 
offered in faith will heal the sick (5:14, 15). The faith referred here is the 
faith of the elder. The sick person has manifested his faith in calling for 
the elders. The elders of course, can pray only according to “the measure 
of faith that God has given him” (Romans 12:3). An elder who has more 
faith will obviously be able to pray with greater faith for the healing than 
another who has less faith.
Sometimes healing may still not come because of some unsettled sin 
in the life of the sick person – usually an unforgiving attitude towards 
someone who has hurt him or her. And so the sick person is urged to 
confess his sin before the healing can come (5:16). Not all sickness is 
due to sin, but some sicknesses remain due to sin. If such a person 
does  not  confess  his  sin,  he  will  not  be  healed,  irrespective  of  how  
many  elders  with  great  faith  come  and  anoint  him  with  oil  and  pray  
for him.
And sometimes praying once may not be enough. We may have to pray 
again  and  again  like  Elijah  did  (5:17,  18).  When  there  was  no  rain  in  
Israel for 3½ years, Elijah prayed earnestly seven times, before the rain 
came (1 Kings 18:44). The context here is praying for healing. And James 
is telling us to follow Elijah’s example. Elijah sent his servant after prayer 
to find out if there was any sign of rain. Six times the servant returned 
saying “No”. That is like asking after prayer, “Is there any sign of healing?” 
The answer may be “No.” Then pray again, and again, and again. How 
many people pray like that? Very few. Most people pray just once, and 
when  healing  has  not  come,  they  say,  “It  must  not  be  the  will  of  God  
for this person to be healed.” Elijah didn’t say that about the rain, after 
praying just once. God wants us to be persistent in our prayer. We must 
be earnest and say, “Lord, why should I be sick? I want to be healthy to 
serve You. I believe You will heal me so that I can serve You.” Pray like 
that when you are sick. 

Practical Exhortations                                                                                                                              923
James
I am not saying that every sickness will be healed. In some instances, 
for  reasons  best  known  to  God  alone,  He  does  not  heal.  Paul  was  not  
healed of a thorn in his flesh to keep him humble. But God still gave 
him grace to finish his course with joy (2 Corinthians 12:7–9). Timothy 
was not healed of his stomach-problem and other sicknesses (1 Timothy 
5:23). But Timothy too must have received grace and finished his course 
with joy. Generally speaking however, God wants us to be fit and healthy 
so that we can serve Him. “Those who wait upon the Lord will renew their 
strength. Even young people may faint, but those who wait upon the Lord 
for strength will fly like the eagles” (Isaiah 40:31). So be one who always 
waits upon the Lord.
In a closing word, James encourages us to work with those we know 
who have strayed from the truth and to draw them back to the Lord 
(5:20).
Let us manifest our faith by the many works that James has described 
in his letter. Amen.



1 PETER
The True Grace of God
P
eter  writes  to  all  those  who  live  as  foreigners  in  this  world.  That  
is  our  calling  –  to  live  as  foreigners  here  on  earth  –  because  our  
 citizenship is in heaven. 
The theme of his letter, Peter says is: “Standing firm in the true grace 
of God” (5:12).
We have seen that James wrote about the true faith – because there 
is a counterfeit faith that does not produce works. Peter writes about 
the true grace because there is a counterfeit grace that does not lead 
Christians to overcome sin and Satan in their lives. So Peter wanted to 
explain the different aspects of the true grace of God. 
In 1:1, 2, he begins by telling us that God chose us according to His 
foreknowledge. That teaches us clearly that God’s choice of us to be His 
children  was  not  arbitrary  He  did  not  pick  names  randomly.  He  chose  
us because He knows the end from the beginning. God looked into the 
future and saw those who would respond to the message of the gospel 
and  He  chose  them.  Foreknowledge  alone  was  the  basis  of  His  choice.  
Peter is very clear on that – and it is important for us to remember that. 
God knows the whole future, but He does not influence the actions. 
Consider an illustration. When you watch a video-film (in which you 
had no part), you know very well that you are not influencing anyone in 
that video movie. If someone did something good or bad in that video, you 
didn’t make him do it. But whereas you can only watch a movie of events 
that  have  already  taken  place,  God  can  watch  a  video-movie  of  events  
in  the  future.  But,  as  in  any  video  that  you  watch,  God  also  doesn’t  
influence anyone’s decisions in the movie. He just sees it. He sees some 
people accepting Christ and many rejecting Him. And God chose those 
who accepted Christ. That is an illustration of His foreknowledge.

926 Through the Bible: The True Grace of God
1 Peter
In 1:2, we see the whole Trinity. The Father chooses us, the Holy Spirit 
sanctifies us and the purpose is that we obey the Son the Lord Jesus 
Christ. God has reserved a great inheritance for us in heaven (1:4). That 
inspires us in our battles here on earth. All the trials that we go through 
on earth are only, “for a little while” (1:6). From the standpoint of eter-
nity, even 100 years is only a little while. This eternal perspective is what 
we must always have in the midst of our trials. All the apostles had this 
perspective. James refers to our life as a vapour (James 4:14). Paul refers 
to  “our momentary affliction”  (2  Corinthians  4:17).  Remember  that  the  
theme of this letter is the true grace of God. So one of the first things we 
understand here is that it is perfectly normal for those who receive the 
true grace of God to be distressed by various types of trials.
Faith Tested by Fire
The purpose of those trials is to prove the genuineness of your faith – like 
“gold tested in the fire”. When gold is dug from the depths of the earth it is 
not pure. The only way to purify it is by putting it into the fire. You can’t 
purify gold by scrubbing it with soap and water. That only removes the 
dirt. But to remove the metals that are mixed in the gold, it has to be put 
into the fire. Then all the alloys in it are melted away and the pure gold 
comes forth. The trials you go through can be fiery. It hurts, and you feel 
as if you are in the fire. The only purpose is to get rid of things in your 
life  that  are  impure.  For  example,  in  countries,  where  Christians  were  
persecuted  and  their  property  was  taken  away,  what  was  the  result?  
They became better pilgrims. They became less attached to their prop-
erty because now they had nothing. But where there is no persecution, 
even the best of believers can be very attached to their property and their 
possessions. We may imagine we are not attached to them, but we are 
deceiving ourselves. And so, God may allow persecution to come in our 
land one day – and then we will be purified.
When  the  Communists  ruled  Russia,  I  have  heard  that  Christians  
could not get a college education or good jobs. They could only get lowly 
jobs like cleaning the streets. In such situations, we easily get detached 
from the honour and sense of importance that comes from having high 
positions and big jobs. All the scum from the gold is burnt away, and we 
become really pure. That’s why it is in places where there is persecution 
today that you have some of the finest Christians in the world. And that 
is why I never pray that there should be no persecution of Christians in 
India – because then I would be praying against the purification of the 
church. I don’t pray for persecution, but I don’t pray against it either. The 
Lord knows what is best for the church in India at any time. So I leave 
it to Him to decide. Either way is equally fine with me. This will be our 
attitude when we receive the true grace of God. 

Faith Tested by Fire                                                                                                                                   927
1 Peter
Peter goes on to say that all this will result in bringing much praise and 
glory and honour to Christ when He returns. In the midst of these trials, 
even though we don’t see Jesus, we still love Him, trust Him and rejoice 
with great joy. Peter had seen Jesus physically. But Jesus said, “Blessed 
are those who have not seen and yet believe” (John 20:29). I  don’t know 
how many of you believe that verse – that, we who have not seen Jesus 
physically are more blessed than those like Peter, who saw Him physi-
cally. I believe that with all my heart, because Jesus said so. Peter goes 
on  to  say  that  as  a  result  of  going  through  trials  faithfully,  we  receive  
“the salvation of our souls” (1:9). The apostles spoke about the salvation 
our souls more than salvation from hell.
Our soul has inherited selfishness and pride and many other evils from 
Adam. We need to be saved from all the evil that we have inherited from 
Adam – such as our attachment to material things, our love of honour, 
and our self-centred way of life. Fiery trials and persecution help greatly 
in delivering us from many evils.
Think of the trial of having a mentally-challenged child. Some people 
think of that as a great misfortune. None of us would pray to have such 
children. But if God allows a family that loves Him to have such a child, 
we can be sure that God will make it work for their good. I have noticed 
in families that have such children, that there is a tenderness and a 
spirit of sacrifice and service among the other children more than in 
other  families.  Very  often,  there  is  a  pride  that  comes  unconsciously  
into the hearts of parents whose children are all smart and capable. 
Pride does not belong to heaven; it belongs to hell. But, unfortunately 
pride is found in the families of many believers.
God  allows  all  His  children  to  face  trials.  In  His  great  wisdom,  He  
knows exactly when to send them. When we stand before the Lord, we 
will discover that God never made a single mistake in any of the trials 
He allowed in our lives. Every single trial He allowed in our lives, we will 
discover in that day, was to purify us as gold. If you believe that, you will 
praise the Lord at all times. You will have inexpressible joy in the midst 
of your trials – and that will result in the salvation of your soul. This is 
the salvation that the prophets in past times sought to understand, but 
could not. Even the angels long to look into this (1:12). But now the Holy 
Spirit  sent  from  heaven  has  anointed  people  who  preach  this  gospel.  
So, Peter says, since we have such a wonderful gospel, and we have to 
go through these trials only for a short period, we should sharpen our 
minds looking forward to the coming of Christ and not be disturbed by 
the trials that we face (1:13).
He then reminds us of our calling to be holy like our heavenly Father 
(1:15).  That  is  the  reason  why  God  seeks  to  purify  us  like  gold.  That 
is why “the affliction of the righteous are many” (Psalm 34:19), whereas 

928 Through the Bible: The True Grace of God
1 Peter
worldly  people  have  a  relatively  easier  path  through  life.  The  One  Who  
has called us is holy, and so we must be holy too. The little kittens must 
keep themselves clean like their mother-cat. Little piglets however remain 
filthy like their mother-pig. Once upon a time our father was the devil – 
and we were like him. We told lies, we fought, we gossiped and we were 
interested in sinful things, like all unclean spirits are. Then one day God 
became our Father. That is something like a piglet suddenly becoming a 
kitten! Now we must be holy in everything.
If we call God as our Father, One Who is totally impartial in judging 
everybody’s  work,  then  we  must  conduct  ourselves  with  intense  rever-
ence for Him throughout our earthly life (1:17). We must remember that 
we were not purchased with silver or gold, but with the precious blood of 
Christ. If we obey the truth that God reveals to us day by day, our souls 
will be purified (1:22). In the midst of fiery trials, as we obey God’s word, 
the muck of sin will be burnt away from our lives, and we will gradually 
become more Christlike.
There  is  a  certain  hardness  in  believers  who  have  never  faced  any  
serious trials in their lives. I feel sorry for those believers who have never 
faced sorrow, or pain, or financial difficulties, but who live in comfort and 
ease with their children growing up in wealth and affluence. Gentleness 
and humility will be missing in their lives. Compare them with believers 
who  have  faced  great  sorrows  and  trials  in  faith,  and  you  will  notice  a  
marked difference. These latter ones have been purified like gold. Impure 
gold and pure gold may look the same to a layman; but if you take them 
both to a goldsmith, he will notice the difference immediately. When God 
takes someone through trials and he has been faithful to God in them, 
that will show in his character. You will find that such believers have no 
problem at all to love others or to take a lowly place. This, as Peter says, 
“is the true grace of God.”
Spiritual Growth
In Chapter 2, Peter speaks about spiritual growth. We grow not only by 
facing trials, but also by having a thirst for the milk of the word of God. 
As  soon  as  a  baby  is  born  it  begins  to  cry.  And  very  soon  it  is  crying  
for milk many times a day. Nobody teaches that baby to cry for milk. It 
cries out of a sense of need. A baby that does not cry for milk every day 
is  sick.  That  is  also  one  of  the  tests  of  a  genuine  new  birth.  If  you  are  
really born again (as it says in 1:23, “born again not with perishable, but 
imperishable seed”) you will “like newborn babies, long for the pure milk 
of the word” (2:2). When someone says that he is born again but does not 
long for the milk of the word daily, I question the genuineness of his new 
birth. I belonged from birth to a church that did not place any emphasis 
on God’s Word. But when I was born again I found a cry in my heart for 
God’s word every day. Nobody had to tell me to read God’s Word. Such is 

Submission to Authority                                                                                                                          929
1 Peter
the  experience  of  everyone  who  is  truly  born  again.  We  need  the  word  
of God to “grow in respect to salvation” (2:2) – that is being saved from 
everything un-Christlike in our soul – which is the salvation of our souls.
As we grow in the Lord, He brings us into fellowship with others of like 
mind,  with  whom  we  can  be  built  up  together  as  a  spiritual  house  for  
the Lord (2:5). This is taught in all the epistles. The true grace of God will 
not allow you to live as an individualistic Christian. It will compel you to 
join with others to be built up together with them – just like bricks put 
together next to each other in the building of a house. The true grace of 
God brings people into fellowship. We are not only God’s house but also 
a chosen race, a holy nation and a people for God’s own possession (2:9). 
The purpose of God in this is that we may show forth His excellencies to 
the evil world around us – how God has called us out of darkness into His 
marvellous light. This is the true grace of God.
Submission to Authority
Then Peter goes on to say how we are to show forth this life. “Keep your 
behaviour excellent among the heathen” (2:12). He then goes on to speak 
about  submission.  A  man  who  experiences  the  true  grace  of  God  will  
always submit to authority wherever he goes. He will have no problem 
at  all  with  submission.  Sin  originated  in  rebellion,  long  before  Adam  
was created. The highest archangel rebelled against God’s authority and 
became Satan immediately. That is why “rebellion is like the sin of witch-
craft” (1 Samuel 15:23) – for a rebellious spirit brings one in touch with 
evil spirits, just as much as witchcraft does. Jesus overcame Satan by 
living in the very opposite way. He humbled Himself and came down to 
earth in perfect submission to His Father; and here on earth He submit-
ted to imperfect Joseph and Mary for 30 years, for those were the human 
authorities His heavenly Father had placed over Him. The one who has 
experienced  the  true  grace  of  God  will  experience  salvation  in  his  soul  
from the spirit of rebellion. If you have a problem in submitting to author-
ity, you need to be saved in your soul.
Christians  are  called  to  submit  to  all  human  authorities,  to  kings,  
governors, etc., (2:13, 14). At that time the emperor of Rome was Nero, 
one of the most wicked kings that ever ruled Rome, and one who perse-
cuted and killed Christians. Yet Peter tells Christians not only to submit 
to him, but also to “honour the king” (2:17). He also says that we must, 
“honour all men.” (2:17). Under the old covenant, the law was to honour 
aged  people  (Leviticus  19:32).  But  under  the  new  covenant,  we  are  to  
honour all people. The standard in every area is higher under the new 
covenant. Under the old covenant, people had to give 10% to God. In the 
new  covenant,  we  have  to  give  everything  (Luke  14:33).  Under  the  old  
covenant, one day was to be kept holy (the Sabbath). In the new coven-
ant, every day is to be holy. Under the old covenant the firstborn male 

930 Through the Bible: The True Grace of God
1 Peter
child had to be dedicated to God. In the new covenant, all our child ren 
are to be dedicated to God. A man who has experienced the grace of God 
has no difficulty in honouring all people. We are to be servants like Jesus, 
and so we are happy to honour everyone and to “consider all others as 
more important than ourselves” (Philippians 2:3).
Then he speaks specifically to servants and tells them to be submis-
sive to their masters. All the apostles taught servants to submit to their 
masters.  A  Christian  who  has  a  spirit  of  rebellion  against  his  authori-
ties in his office or factory is a very poor witness for Christ. A Christian 
student who rebels against his teachers in school or college is also a very 
poor witness for Christ. Such a Christian has not understood “the true 
grace of God” at all. He has not understood that Jesus came and submit-
ted to imperfect earthly parents for 30 years. This is a lesson we all need 
to learn. Servants be submissive to your masters with all respect. If you 
work in an office, factory, school, hospital or anything, you must show 
respect to those above you in that place.
We must teach our children to respect their teachers, and not to gang 
up with other children and make fun of the teachers. Servants must learn 
to show respect not only to those masters who are good and gentle but 
also to those who are unreasonable. It’s easy to submit to a good master, 
but a Christian who has experienced “the true grace of God” will submit 
to  an  unreasonable  master  as  well  (2:18). It  is  when  you  submit  to  an  
unreasonable  master  that  your  light  shines  as  a  Christian.  A  burning  
candle is not easily visible in the sunlight. But at night everyone can see 
its light. Even so, a Christian’s light is seen most brightly when he is in 
dark surroundings.
There is no virtue in submitting patiently when you are punished for 
having done something wrong. But when you patiently endure suffering, 
even when you did what was right, then God is pleased with you (2:20). 
Suffering  unjustly  is  one  of  the  great  themes  of  Peter’s  letter.  He  goes  
on  to  say  that  that  was  exactly  how  Jesus  also  suffered.  He  suffered  
unjustly and has left us an example to follow in His steps. We are called 
here to “follow in His steps Who never sinned, Who never told a lie, Who 
never answered back when insulted; and Who, when He suffered, did not 
threaten to get even; but kept entrusting His case to God who judges right-
eously” (2:21–23). This is how a Christian who has understood “the true 
grace of God” also behaves.
It  says  that  Jesus  has  left  us  an  example  to  follow  in  His  footsteps.  
That’s a very popular expression found in Christian hymns: “Following 
in Jesus’ footsteps.” But notice the context here. It is talking about not 
sinning,  never  telling  a  lie,  and  suffering  injustice  quietly.  That  is  the  
way to follow in Jesus’ footsteps. I wonder how many Christians mean 
this when they talk about discipleship and following Jesus! This is “the 
true grace of God”. It is much more than mere forgiveness of our sins! 

Suffering Unjustly                                                                                                                                     931
1 Peter
I  want  to  add  a  word  of  explanation  here  about  2:24,  which  reads:  
“He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die 
to  sin  and  live  to  righteousness;  for  by  His  wounds  you  were  healed”. 
That last phrase “by His wounds you were healed” is a quote from Isaiah 
53:5.  In  1  Peter,  the  Holy  Spirit  gives  us  His  interpretation  of  what  He  
inspired  Isaiah  to  write  in  the  Old  Testament.  This  phrase  does  not 
refer to healing from physical sickness. It is referring to healing from sin 
(spiritual sickness) and becoming righteous (spiritually healthy). This is 
clearly explained in the phrase that precedes it: “that we might die to sin 
and live to righteousness”. There are some who say that this verse teaches 
that Christ’s death on the cross brings healing to all our sicknesses just 
like it brings forgiveness to all our sins. If so, then why is it that many 
who have enough faith to receive forgiveness of all their sins are unable 
to have faith for the lesser miracle of healing from all their sicknesses? 
That failure itself proves that the interpretation given by such people is 
wrong. The Holy Spirit’s interpretation of Isaiah 53:5 here should put an 
end to all such wrong teachings.
Suffering Unjustly
Peter  then  goes  on  to  point  out  the  example  of  Christ  who  suffered  
unjustly  to  wives  who  suffer  unjustly  (3:1).  “Do  you  have  a  husband  
who  is  unreasonable  and  does  not  obey  God’s  word?”  Submit  to  him,  
just  like  Jesus  submitted  to  unreasonable  people.  “In  the  same  way” 
in 3:1, means “in the same way as Jesus submitted” (2:21). Wives who 
have  unreasonable  husbands  have  a  great  opportunity  to  follow  in  
Jesus’  footsteps.  When  Jesus  suffered  injustice  without  complaining  
on the cross, a Roman centurion, who had crucified many people, had 
never seen anything like this. And he said, “This is the Son of God” and 
was converted instantaneously. A thief hanging next to Jesus also had 
never seen anything like this. He also believed that Jesus was the Son 
of God and said, “Lord, remember me when You come in Your kingdom”. 
He also was converted. And when your unreasonable husband sees your 
Christlike  conduct,  he  also  will  get  converted.  Peter  says,  “You  will  be  
able to win him without preaching one word to him” (3:1). Many Christian 
wives try to convert their husbands by preaching to them. But the more 
they preach to them, the more their husbands turn away from the Lord. 
Try the submission-method in future and stop your preaching.
Then Peter teaches women how to adorn themselves. Not with fancy 
hairstyles  or  gold  jewellery  or  expensive  dresses,  but  with  the  inner  
beauty of “a gentle, quiet spirit” (3:4). That beauty will never fade away 
and never perish. That is the hidden beauty that God is looking for. It is 
very precious in His sight. Most men in this world are blind to this real 
beauty, because they do not know God.

932 Through the Bible: The True Grace of God
1 Peter
When young men ask me for advice on the type of sister they should 
marry, I ask them: “Do you want to marry a sister who is precious in God’s 
sight?” Then I point them to this verse and tell them, “Look for a sister who 
has the imperishable beauty of a gentle, quiet spirit.” This is not referring 
to silence in speech but to silence in her spirit. It is not a question of how 
much  she  talks,  but  rather  how  she  talks  and  conducts  herself.  Peter  
says that this was how godly sisters (in the past) like Sarah were, who 
obeyed Abraham (3:5, 6). We can know that a sister has received “the true 
grace of God”, if she manifests a gentle, quiet spirit. 
How  can  we  know  if  a  husband  has  experienced  “the  true  grace  of  
God”?  Peter  says  that  it  is  by  his  living  in  an  understanding  way  with  
his wife, respecting her as a weaker vessel. Such a husband will never 
put burdens on his wife that he should be carrying himself. For example, 
if you and your wife are travelling with two suitcases – one big and one 
small – you will definitely carry the big suitcase yourself and give her the 
small one. It must be the same with burdens in the home as well. There 
are  many  burdens  that  wives  carry  in  a  home  that  are  much  heavier  
than suitcases, and many husbands don’t even lift a finger to help them. 
For example, a wife may be struggling in the morning cooking breakfast, 
looking  after  the  baby  and  getting  the  older  children  ready  for  school.  
Her husband may be sitting quietly, reading his Bible and asking God to 
speak to him and give him some new revelation! If he has ears to hear, 
he  will  hear  God  saying,  “Close  your  Bible  and  go  and  help  your  wife”! 
A husband who obeys that voice has understood “the true grace of God”. 
If a husband and wife live like that, they will be “joint-heirs” – a king and 
a  queen  together  –  of  the  grace  of  life.”  What  a  powerful  testimony  for  
Christ such a home will be, in this evil world!
Various Exhortations
The Living Bible paraphrase of 3:8–11 reads like this: 
“And  now  this  word  to  all  of  you:  You  should  be  like  one  big  happy  
family,  full  of  sympathy  toward  each  other,  loving  one  another  with  
tender  hearts  and  humble  minds.  Don’t  repay  evil  for  evil.  Don’t  snap  
back at those who say unkind things about you. Instead, pray for God’s 
help for them, for we are to be kind to others, and God will bless us for 
it. If you want a happy, good life, keep control of your tongue, and guard 
your lips from telling lies. Turn away from evil and do good. Try to live in 
peace even if you must run after it to catch and hold it!” 
These  exhortations  are  clear  and  simple  and  need  no  explanation.  
This is a description of church life, where everyone lives under “the true 
grace of God”. Peter also emphasises the importance of the control of our 
tongue – as in other epistles. And then Peter says, “If you live like this, 

Keep Fervent in Your Love                                                                                                                       933
1 Peter
zealous for what is good, who can harm you?” (3:13). This verse is very 
similar to Romans 8:28. All through your life, no-one will be able to do 
any eternal harm to you, if you decide to live like this.
In 3:15, Peter tells us how to reply to others who question us about the 
“reason for the hope that is in us”. He says that you must always reply 
with  gentleness  and  respect.  We  must  never  speak  rudely  to  anyone,  
even if they speak to us rudely. Jesus told us, “Learn from Me, for I am 
gentle  and  humble  in  spirit”  (Matthew  11:29).  Gentleness  is  a  primary  
mark of those who have understood “the true grace of God”. A person who 
is harsh has not understood grace as yet.
“Do what is right; then if men speak against you, calling you evil names, 
they will become ashamed of themselves for falsely accusing you when 
you have only done what is good. Remember, if God wants you to suffer, 
it  is  better  to  suffer  for  doing  good  than  for  doing  wrong!”  (3:16,  17  
- Living).
That is what it means to follow in Jesus’ footsteps. 
In 4:1, we are told that if we “suffer in the flesh as Jesus suffered in the 
flesh,” we will finish with sinning. Since this is talking about finishing 
with sinning, we need to understand this verse correctly. Our Lord never 
asks us to go through any suffering that He never went through Himself. 
He humbled Himself first of all under His mother Mary. Consider for 
example,  when  Jesus  as  a  little  boy  was  playing  some  game  with  His  
friends outside, and Mary called Him and asked Him to go and get some 
water from the well urgently. Most children would have told their mother 
to wait. But Jesus denied Himself and learned obedience through suffer-
ing – the suffering of denying His own will (Hebrews 5:8). This is how He 
“suffered in the flesh” for 33½ years. If we arm ourselves with the same 
mind, we too will stop sinning. That means to determine, “Lord, I don’t 
care how much I have to deny myself. I am not going to sin. I am going to 
put my self-will to death.” Anyone who has that attitude will stop sinning 
very soon.
Then you will no longer live the rest of your life for the lusts of men but 
to do the will of God (4:2). This is “the true grace of God”. We are living at 
a time when “the end of all things” is much nearer than it was in Peter’s 
time. So we must live “soberly for the purpose of prayer” (4:7).
Keep Fervent in Your Love
Then Peter gives some practical advice on how to remain in fervent love 
for one another: Forgive everyone and be hospitable (4:9). One who has 
experienced “the true grace of God” will be large-hearted. His home will be 
open to God’s people. His hands will be open to help the needy. Stingy, 
miserly  people,  who  are  always  calculating  in  their  giving  to  the  needy  

934 Through the Bible: The True Grace of God
1 Peter
know nothing of the grace of God. In India, I have noticed that it is the 
poor people who are really hospitable. The richer people are, the stingier 
they become.
If God has given you a spiritual gift, exercise that gift in humility (4:10). 
Even that is a part of “the true grace of God”. And when you preach God’s 
Word, preach as the very mouthpiece of God. Those who serve must serve 
with  the  power  that  God  gives.  And  in  everything  God  alone  must  be  
glorified (4:11).
We must not be surprised when we go through fiery suffering, as if 
that  was  a  strange  thing  to  happen  to  a  believer  (4:12).  God  tests  us  
through such sufferings. This world is not our home. We are like fish 
out of water here. So we will suffer. That is the experience of everyone 
who  experiences  “the  true  grace  of  God”.  If  we  are  reviled  for  the  name  
of  Christ,  we  should  consider  ourselves  blessed,  for  that  is  an  honour  
(4:14). But we should never suffer for doing wrong to others. Peter says, 
“Don’t suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busy-
body  in  other  people’s  matters”  (4:15).  Most  Christians  never  suffer  as  
murderers, thieves or evildoers, but many unfortunately are busybodies 
in other people’s matters. They don’t know how to mind their own busi-
ness. That is a very bad testimony.
Instead of judging other people, we must learn to judge ourselves first 
(4:17). In the world, people put themselves first in every area except in 
the matter of judgement. In judgement they judge others first. A true 
Christian  however  lives  by  the  very  opposite  principle.  He  puts  others  
first in everything except judgement. He judges himself first. Those who 
have experienced “the true grace of God” will never judge others, but only 
themselves. The happiest people in the world are those who judge them-
selves always and never judge others. This is the prime mark of all who 
belong to the true family (household) of God (4:17).
Then Peter speaks to the elders of the churches (5:1). Elders who have 
experienced the  true  grace  of  God will look after their flock voluntarily, 
cheerfully, and without seeking for money (5:2). They serve God’s church, 
whether they receive money for their needs or not. They do not serve for 
a salary or for money. One who serves the Lord for money knows nothing 
about the true grace of God. A godly elder will also never lord it over his 
flock, but will be an example to them in all areas (5:3).  Then  one  day  
when the Chief Shepherd returns, he will receive a crown of glory from 
Him.
God Gives Grace to the Humble
Young people can also experience the true grace of God. When they expe-
rience  it,  they  will  gladly  submit  to  their  elders  (5:5). “God  is  opposed  
to  the  proud  but  gives  grace  to  the  humble.  Therefore,  humble  yourself  
under  the  mighty  hand  of  God”  (5:5,  6).  The  mighty  hand  of  God  is  the  

God Gives Grace to the Humble                                                                                                             935
1 Peter
circumstances that God allows us to face in our life. That difficult boss, 
that  troublesome  neighbour,  the  difficult  circumstances,  the  financial 
difficulty, sickness, trials, etc. When  we  face  these  circumstances,  we  
must humble ourselves under them. That means we do not grumble or 
complain  but  accept  them  joyfully  as  having  been  permitted  by  God.  
Then God will exalt us over our circumstances and make us victorious. 
God knows how and when to end the trial and then His mighty hand will 
exalt you. The same mighty hand that crushed you will exalt you. Jesus 
submitted under the mighty hand of God. It pleased the Father to crush 
Him (Isaiah 53:10). Then one day the Father raised Him up. He will do 
the same for you. When you humble yourself like that, you will be able to 
resist the devil, firm in your faith (5:8, 9). Satan may come as a roaring 
lion,  but  he  won’t  be  able  to  harm  you,  if  you  have  humbled  yourself  
under God’s hand.
All the suffering we face on earth is only “for a little while” (5:10). That 
little while could be 70 years. But then God will “perfect you, confirm you, 
strengthen you and establish you.”
Peter concludes by saying that all that he has written in this letter is 
“the true grace of God” (5:12). In our day when a lot of counterfeit grace is 
being preached, it is good to study this letter of Peter carefully so that we 
understand the true grace of God.



2 PETER
Godliness and False Teachers
T
his is a brief epistle in which Peter speaks first of all about “partak-
ing of God’s nature” (1:4). This is the greatest of all of God’s promises 
given to us. Then he also speaks about some of the dangers that 
Christians can face if they are not careful.
Partaking of God’s Nature
The Christian life is not a life of following many rules and regulations, as 
it was under the old covenant. The promises God has given us in the new 
covenant are far superior to those in the old covenant. The old covenant 
offered people, material prosperity, physical healing, many children, an 
abundance of cattle and sheep, rich harvests and overflowing barns of 
grain. But we can now have something far better than all that. We can 
actually partake of the Divine nature. That is the greatest gift that God 
can give anyone. There is absolutely nothing superior to that. And here 
is  another  promise  “God  has  given  us  everything  necessary  for  life  and  
godliness” (1:3). There are many things in this world that we don’t have 
answers for. But for living a godly life, God has revealed everything neces-
sary for that in the Scriptures. And He offers us the power of His Holy 
Spirit to live that life.
Since God has given us these promises, what should we do? First of 
all we must be diligent (1:5). We must work hard to add moral excellence 
to our faith. As we walk by faith, our moral excellence will increase and 
then  we  will  increase  in  our  knowledge  of  God.  As  we  increase  in  the  
knowledge of God we will develop more self-control in our life – over our 
tongue and in other areas of life. And as we have more self-control, we 
will  find  that  we  become  more  patient.  The  more  patient  we  become, 
the  more  godly  we  will  become.  The  more  godly  we  become,  the  more  
we will be able to love our fellow believers. The more we love our fellow 

938 Through the Bible: Godliness and False Teachers
2 Peter
believers, the more we will be able to love all people. This is the progres-
sion mentioned in 1:5–7.
And if we work hard to ensure that these qualities keep increasing, then 
our  life  and  our  ministry  will  be  abundantly  fruitful  and  we  will  not  be  
useless Christians (1:8). But if we lack these qualities, we will gradually 
become spiritually blind (1:9). Another way to become spiritually blind is 
by forgetting what type of sinners we were in our unconverted days (1:9). 
When believers forget what filthy sinners they were once and what a filthy 
pit Jesus pulled them out of, it is then that they begin to despise other 
people. That proves that such believers have become spiritually blind!
But if we follow the exhortations given in 1:5–9, then we are assured 
that we will not only never fall away and lose our salvation, but we will 
receive an abundant entrance into God’s kingdom (1:11). Many believers 
are happy if they just make it to heaven, “by the skin of my teeth” as it 
were!  But  I  want  “an  abundant  entrance”,  where  the  Lord  says  to  me,  
“Well done, good and faithful servant”. I want to please God with all my 
heart  in  this  one  earthly  life,  because  Jesus  suffered  so  much  for  me.  
Peter says if we go the way described in 1:5–9, we will have that abundant 
entrance. Every believer should long to have such an abundant entrance 
into God’s kingdom.
Peter  says  that  the  Lord  has  shown  him  that  he  will  be  leaving  the  
earth soon (1:13, 14). It is wonderful to see that these apostles like Peter 
and  Paul  lived  so  close  to  the  Lord  that  the  Lord  showed  them  clearly  
when their time to leave the earth was near (2 Timothy 4:6). But as long 
as Peter was alive, he would continue to remind those believers of these 
important  spiritual  truths,  even  though  they  already  knew  them,  and  
even though he had written to them about these matters earlier (1:12–14).  
The apostles were like the Old Testament prophets. They kept on preach-
ing the same things again and again. They did not seek for a reputation 
to always preach something new, like most modern-day preachers. If the 
people needed to hear some truth again, then they would repeat it. So 
Peter  kept  on  telling  people  about  the  true  grace  of  God,  about  God  
having provided everything necessary for a godly life and about partaking 
of the divine nature. As long as he was alive, he would keep on remind-
ing  them  of  these  truths.  And  he  would  write  them  down  in  letters  so  
that they would remember these truths even after he had left the earth 
(1:15). What a burden these apostles had for their flock. They were not 
professional  preachers  preaching  for  money!  Peter  never  realised  that  
what he wrote would encourage and challenge billions of people for the 
next 2000 years!! Peter then tells them how he personally saw the glory 
of Jesus on the mount of transfiguration and that he was not telling them 
fairy-tales (1:17).
Peter then says how this was a fulfilment of the prophecies in the Old 
Testament  which  were  like  a  light  shining  in  the  dark.  Here  is  a  para-
phrase of these verses. 

False Teachers – Sexual Sin and Love of Money                                                                                  939
2 Peter
“So we have seen and proved that what the prophets said came true. 
You will do well to pay close attention to everything they have written, 
for, like lights shining into dark corners, their words help us to under-
stand many things that otherwise would be dark and difficult. But when 
you consider the wonderful truth of the prophets’ words, then the light 
will dawn in your souls and Christ the Morning Star will shine in your 
hearts. For no prophecy recorded in Scripture was ever thought up by 
the prophet himself. It was the Holy Spirit within these godly men who 
gave them true messages from God” (1:19–21 - Living).
False Teachers – Sexual Sin and Love of Money 
Then  Peter  says:  “But  there  were  false  prophets,  too,  in  those  days,  
just  as  there  will  be  false  teachers  among  you.  They  will  cleverly  tell  
their lies about God..., many will follow their evil teaching that there is 
nothing wrong with sexual sin. And because of them Christ and His way 
will be scoffed at. These teachers in their greed will tell you anything to 
get hold of your money” (2:1–3 - Living).
Notice here the two main ways in which a false teacher can be detected 
– sexual sin and love of money (2:2, 3). It is not by checking a preacher’s 
doctrines primarily that we will be able to distinguish the false teacher 
from  the  true.  Because  there  are  many  more  false  teachers  whose  
doctrines  are  all  correct.  If  a  preacher  comes  preaching  from  the  Gita  
or  the  Koran,  or  says  that  Jesus  Christ  is  not  God,  no  true  Christian  
will be deceived by him. But if someone comes preaching from the Bible 
and preaches all the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith, most 
Christians will never consider him to be a false teacher at all.
But Peter says here, that the primary marks of false teachers are their 
loose attitude towards sexual sin and their greed for money (2:2, 3). Their 
eyes are full of adultery. So I warn all sisters: “Be careful of any preacher 
whose eyes are not pure, who you feel is looking at you in a lustful way. 
Stay clear of such a preacher, if you value your life. He is a false teacher. 
And to both brothers and sisters I say, stay clear of any preacher who 
urges  you  to  give  your  money  for  his  ministry  and  quotes  Scripture  to  
pressurise you to give. Beware of preachers who have become rich through 
preaching the gospel. Sexual impurity and greed for money are the two 
primary characteristics of false teachers. If you watch out for these two 
things in a preacher, you will be saved from many false teachers.
Then Peter says that just like God punished 
1. the angels who sinned in Noah’s time, and 
2. the whole world of ungodly people (except Noah’s family), and
3. the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and
4. Balaam the false prophet 
– even so, He will severely punish all false teachers as well (2:4–16). 

940 Through the Bible: Godliness and False Teachers
2 Peter
Noah is called “a preacher of righteousness” here (2:5). That is the type 
of preacher that God needs in these last days, which have become like 
the days of Noah. And once again Peter repeats the two primary marks 
of false teachers – adultery and greed (2:14). In the case of Balaam, his 
donkey  knew  more  about  God  than  “the  prophet”.  So  it  is  with  today’s  
false teachers too! They are worse than animals.
These false teachers may have known the way of righteousness at one 
time. But they have turned away from it now (2:21). They have become 
like the pig that has gone back to its wallowing in its mire and like the 
dog that returns to its own vomit (2:22). There are many false teachers 
and  false  prophets  in  the  world  today,  who  started  out  as  very  sincere  
people, and were like washed pigs. But they never partook of God’s nature. 
They remained as clean pigs, instead of partaking of God’s nature and 
being transformed. They remained as dogs instead of partaking of God’s 
nature. In other words, their cleanliness was only on the outside. They 
never cared about their inner daily walk with God. And so, after a while 
they went back to eat what they had vomited out and back into the muck.
The Promise of Christ’s Coming
Peter tells us that in the last days there will be many mockers who say, 
“Where  is  the  promise  of  Christ’s  coming?”  (3:4).  They  will  make  fun  of  
Christians  who  have  been  preaching  about  Christ’s  return  for  nearly  
2000 years now. That is how they made fun of Noah too, in his day. They 
asked  Noah,  “Where  is  the  rain  that  you  have  been  saying  for  the  last  
120 years will be coming that will destroy all of us?” But the rain came 
suddenly. And Christ too will come suddenly.
“But we who believe in Christ’s coming, how should we be living?” asks 
Peter (3:11, 12). We know that this earth will soon be burned up. How 
then should we be living? We should be living godly lives. If we are not, 
then we are no better than the mockers. Let us “be diligent to be found by 
Him in peace, spotless and blameless” (3:14).
The Lord is not slack or slow to fulfil His promise. He is waiting because 
He wants all people to come to repentance (3:9). That one verse totally 
disproves the theory that God elects just some people to be His children. 
If  God  wanted,  He  could  force  every  human  being  to  repent.  But  that  
would make men into robots. God has given man a free will and He will 
never override that free will and force any man to choose Him. Everyone 
must choose Him voluntarily – for God loves cheerful givers. And so God 
waits for people to repent.
Then Peter refers to Paul’s writings in which there are some things that 
are “hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they 
do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction” (3:15, 16). Peter 
is referring to the false understanding of grace which he tried to correct 
in his first letter – and which is being preached by many preachers even 

The Promise of Christ’s Coming                                                                                                             941
2 Peter
today – where “grace” has become a license to sin without any fear, for 
they say, “Once you are saved by grace, you are saved forever, irrespec-
tive of how you live”! They won’t say it in exactly those words. But that is 
the message people get. More people have gone to hell through believing 
this message of false grace than through believing any other teaching.
So Peter warns us to “be on our guard so that we are not carried away 
by the error of unprincipled men and fall from our steadfastness” (3:17). 
Instead he urges us to “grow in the grace (the true grace of God) and in 
the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ” (3:18).
We praise the Lord for Peter’s two letters and we pray that we will have 
grace to walk in the light of these words inspired by the Holy Spirit.



1 JOHN
Light and Love – Life and Fellowship
T
here are two things that John says here about God. “God is light” 
(1:5) and “God is love” (4:8). And those are two of the main themes 
of his letter – light and love. In practical terms for us, that means 
life and fellowship.
In Jesus was life – and that life was the light of men (John 1:4). It was 
through  the  life  of  Jesus  that  the  light  was  seen  and  it  is  through  our  
life that the light will be seen. God is love and John reminds us of the 
one command that Jesus gave. It is interesting to note none of the first 
three gospel-writers mention the new commandment that Jesus gave His 
disciples: “A new commandment I give unto you that you love one another 
as I have loved you” (John 13:34). John alone emphasises that. And that 
is  what  he  emphasises  in  his  letter  also.  He  says  that  if  you  love  one  
another, the evidence will be fellowship. So ‘Life and fellowship’ are two 
of the important subjects in this letter.
He begins this letter referring to the life of God that was present from 
eternity past (1:1) – “that which was from the beginning”, just as he does 
in his gospel as well (John 1:1).
The Primary Truth
John wrote all his letters just a few years before he died, when he was 
about 95 years old. He had been baptised in the Holy Spirit on the day 
of Pentecost, 65 years earlier. And for 65 years he had walked with God. 
He  had  planted  churches,  exercised  the  gifts  of  the  Spirit,  done  mira-
cles, prophesied, spoken in tongues and seen the ministry of the other 
apostles.  The  other  11  apostles  of  Jesus  had  died,  and  John  was  now  
the only one living. He had seen the mighty move of the Spirit by which 
churches had been established and he had seen the decline of many of 
those churches by the end of the first century. He had heard many false 

944 Through the Bible: Light and Love – Life and Fellowship
1 John
prophets  and  many  false  doctrines.  He  had  seen  many  good  believers  
becoming  fanatical  in  their  zeal.  He  now  writes  as  a  mature  95-year-
old  man  who  knew  God  intimately.  He  could  look  back  over  65  years  
and discern what was important in the Christian life and what was not. 
He could see where people went astray by over-emphasising some truth 
and where they went astray by under-emphasising some other truth. So 
when we study 1 John let us bear in mind that this is the writing of a 
mature apostle – and not that of a young Christian zealot. John waited 
till  he  was  95  years  old  before  he  wrote  anything.  So,  as  we  study  his  
letter, we need to notice carefully not only what he says but also what he 
does not say – because what he does not say will show us the things that 
John realised were not so important. In his 4-page letter, he emphasises 
the most important matters.
For  example,  John  does  not  write  at  all  about  the  pattern  of  church  
government or the church-meeting, speaking in tongues, healing, mate-
rial  prosperity,  evangelism,  etc.  These  are  all  important  matters,  but  
they are not primary, when churches are decaying spiritually. For many 
Christians however, some of these matters are primary. John writes in 
his letter about what was from the beginning, at a time in eternity past, 
when there was no church government, or church-meetings, or believers, 
or human beings, or angels, or heaven, or earth – at a time when only 
God existed.
What  was  there  in  eternity  past?  Only  God  –  Father,  Son  and  Holy  
Spirit.  They  had  eternal  life  and  they  had  perfect fellowship  between  
them.  So  what  John  is  saying  is,  “Remember  that  these  are  the  two  
eternal realities – life and fellowship.” Everything else is only for a short 
period of time. So if we get taken up primarily with matters that are 
only temporal and miss these two great eternal realities, then we would 
have missed everything. That would be akin to polishing the nuts and 
bolts of a car’s wheel, when the car’s engine has broken down! Many 
Christians are occupied with minor issues and have missed the main 
things in the Christian life.
Having  observed  the  development  and  decline  of  Christianity  in  the  
first century, John teaches us what is important for us today. If you don’t 
have the life of God in you, that life of purity, humility, love and good-
ness, then whatever else you may have is worthless. When compared to 
the  life  of  Christ,  everything  else  is  rubbish.  When  you  come  together  
with other believers, if you cannot build fellowship with them, but only 
have activity and ministry, then you are missing out completely on true 
Christianity. Even evangelism will be a waste of effort if it does not lead 
to building fellowship. Remember that in eternity past there was only life 
and fellowship in God.

Eternal Life and Fellowship                                                                                                                     945
1 John
Consider the Christian home. What is the most important thing in a 
home?  Is  it  that  everything  should  be  neat  and  tidy  and  in  its  proper  
place, with nicely painted walls and attractive curtains? No. It is the life 
of God that should be manifest in the husband, wife and children, and in 
the relationships between them.
How can we have this life and fellowship? Through humility. When we 
humble  ourselves,  we  provide  God  with  the  ground  on  which  the  Holy  
Spirit can bring forth His fruits in our lives.
John says in his very first words in this letter that he has heard, seen 
and touched this life of God that was manifested in Jesus (1:1–3). And it 
needs to be manifested again and again in God’s people in every genera-
tion – until Christ’s return. John is not talking about evangelical doctrine 
but of the life of God. Many Christians spend hours arguing over points 
of doctrine – some of them over silly matters like what the initial evidence 
of the baptism of the Holy Spirit is, whether we can take medicines when 
we  are  sick,  and  a  host  of  other  things  like  that,  that  are  not  going  to  
matter at all in eternity.
We are called to proclaim eternal life to the world – that life that never 
had a beginning, that pure and holy life of God Himself. Wherever you 
go till the end of your life, make it your passion to manifest and proclaim 
eternal  life.  When  I  was  a  child  (spiritually),  I  spoke  like  a  child  and  
argued about many minor matters. But now that I have grown up and 
become  a  man  (spiritually),  I  have  put  away  all  those  childish  matters  
(1 Corinthians 13:11). Even the apostle John in his younger days spoke 
foolishly.  He  wanted  to  call  down  fire  from  heaven  to  consume  the 
Samaritans (Luke 9:54). But he grew up. And so must we. We can learn 
from our past mistakes and we can also learn lessons from the mistakes 
that  others  make  –  and  become  wise.  Then  we  can  help  the  younger  
generation not to do the same foolish things that we did when we were 
young. Those who are humble will receive our advice.
Eternal Life and Fellowship
We must emphasise life first and then fellowship. Any so-called “fellow-
ship” without the life of God is a deception. The ecumenical movement in 
Christendom today seeks to unite churches. But it is not on the basis of 
the life of God. Finally they will join with people of other religions as well. 
It is just a matter of time before that happens. That is not the fellowship 
John is talking about in his letter. People can have that type of “fellow-
ship” even in hell.
We must be friendly with all people. But fellowship is a far deeper thing 
than  friendship.  Life  and  fellowship  go  together.  “We  have  seen  that  
eternal life which was with the Father manifested to us. We have seen 

946 Through the Bible: Light and Love – Life and Fellowship
1 John
and heard, and we proclaim it to you. The purpose of proclaiming it to 
you is that you may have fellowship” (1:1–3).
“Our fellowship is with the Father” (1:3). True fellowship is in two direc-
tions, like the two arms of the cross. It is through the cross that we come 
into fellowship with God and also with one another. Between Christ and 
us there is a cross on which He died. Because of that we can have fellow-
ship with our Lord. We can never have fellowship with God apart from 
that, because in ourselves, we will never be good enough. And between 
us  as  believers  also,  there  must  be  a  cross  on  which  each  of  us  die  to  
ourselves,  if  we  want  to  have  fellowship  with  each  other.  Fellowship  is  
impossible without this death on the cross – both in the vertical and in 
the  horizontal  directions.  The  cross  is  the  secret  of  life  and  fellowship.  
There  is  no  life  without  the  cross  and  there  is  no  fellowship  possible  
without the cross.
The cross was in God’s mind from way back in eternity past. The Lamb 
was slain “from before the foundation of the world” (Revelation 13:8 - KJV). 
God knows the end from the beginning and so the Trinity knew from all 
eternity past, that the Second Person would have to come to the earth 
as a Man and be crucified for man’s sins. That was not something God 
decided on, after Adam sinned. It was eternally foreknown. God placed 
a sword in front of the tree of life when Adam sinned. That sword fell on 
Jesus and slew Him. And that sword must fall on our Adamic life too – 
we must accept our place as “crucified with Christ” (Galatians 2:20) – if 
we are to come to the tree of life and have fellowship with God and also 
with each other.
What  is  it  that  causes  problems  among  believers?  The  life  of  Adam.  
If  you  bring  the  life  of  Adam  into  the  church,  it  will  always  produce  
conflict.  If  you  bring  the  intelligence,  reasoning  and  cleverness  of 
Adam into the church, it will always produce conflict. You must put 
all of that intelligence and cleverness that comes from the life of Adam 
under the fiery sword of the Holy Spirit. Don’t kill just the “bad sheep” 
of  Adam.  Kill  the  “good  sheep”  of  Adam  too.  Saul  lost  his  kingdom  
because  he  killed  only  the  bad  sheep  of  Amalek  (a  type  of  the  flesh) 
but  not  the  good  sheep.  What  do  those  bad  sheep  typify?  Jealousy,  
bitterness, sexual sin, love of money, etc. And what do the good sheep 
typify? Human intelligence, cleverness, talents, abilities, etc. Put them 
all to death.
Come to Jesus with empty hands and ask Him to give you His super-
natural gifts to serve Him. Then God will sanctify you and give you His 
life. Then your natural abilities will become servants of the Spirit – and 
you will do God’s work with His power and not your own. But first you 
have to lay everything on the altar. You may say that you have abilities 

No Darkness in Him                                                                                                                                  947
1 John
that God Himself gave you at birth. But even what God gave you has to 
be put on the altar and slain. Isaac was God’s gift to Abraham. But God 
told Abraham to offer up even Isaac on the altar. That is what you have 
to do too, with your God-given talents. So place your intelligence, your 
musical abilities and all your natural talents on the altar and offer them 
as a sacrifice to God. Then let God raise them up from the dead and then 
He will use them for His glory. That’s the only way to serve God. God gave 
me some intelligence too when I was born. But I laid it totally on the altar 
and gave it up to God. He gave it back to me under the anointing of the 
Spirit to use for His glory. That is how our natural talents and abilities 
can be sanctified and become useful to God for His work.
John  says  that  fellowship  will  result  in  fullness  of  joy  (1:4).  Joy  is  a  
major part of the Christian life, because joy is the atmosphere of heaven. 
There is no gloom in heaven. The angels are never discouraged. They are 
always full of life and full of joy. And we can have that joy too, if we have 
fellowship with God. The Holy Spirit has come to bring the atmosphere of 
heaven into our hearts – and part of that is a fullness of joy.
Satan will tell you that if you give your life totally to God, you will be 
miserable,  gloomy,  depressed,  and  long-faced.  It  is  unfortunately  true  
that some Christians do give that impression by their appearance. I heard 
a story of a long-faced Christian witnessing to someone and asking him, 
“Would you like to receive Christ into your heart?” That person looked at 
the Christian’s face and replied, “No, thank you. I have enough problems 
already!” That is a poor witness for our wonderful Lord. If your life and 
your home are not radiating the joy of the Lord, then something is wrong 
in your life. You have missed the will of God somewhere.
No Darkness in Him
John goes on to say that if you want this life, fellowship and joy, then the 
very first thing you need to understand is that God is light and that there 
is no darkness in Him at all (1:5) – zero lying, zero impurity, zero hatred, 
zero pride, etc. Do you want such a life where you never tell a lie, never 
hate anyone, where you are never jealous of anyone and never proud? 
If you choose that life, you will never be gloomy or discouraged. You will 
live a life of perpetual joy in the Lord. Is it possible to live such a life on 
this sin-cursed earth? Yes it is. Philippians 4:4 commands us to rejoice 
in the Lord always. That was written for people here on earth and not for 
those in heaven! Your joy can be full here on earth, whether you are being 
persecuted like John on Patmos, or whether you are sitting comfortably 
at home. Your joy will never be dependent on your circumstances, if you 
choose to walk in the light of God at all times.
But if we say we have fellowship with Him and we walk in darkness, 
then we are not practising the truth. There are many Christians who say 
that they have fellowship with God but walk in sin. You can see in their 

948 Through the Bible: Light and Love – Life and Fellowship
1 John
faces that the joy of the Lord is not there. There is no spring in their step, 
no song on their lips, and no sparkle in their eyes. They have missed the 
joy of fellowship with God. The older we become as believers, the more joy 
we will have, if we are walking with God.
1:7 is a beautiful verse, but most quote only part of it. They say, “The 
blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin”. But that is not what this 
verse says. It says, “If we walk in the light as He is in the light, then (and 
then only) the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.” The blood of Jesus 
does not cleanse everyone who confesses some sins to God. It cleanses 
only those who walk in the light of God. That refers to people who hide 
nothing in their lives from God and who are totally free from hypocrisy. 
This  verse  is  not  talking  about  perfection.  It  is  telling  us  to  be  totally  
honest about our sins and not be hypocrites.
This verse also says that the blood of Jesus will cleanse us, and not 
just cover our sins, as it was in the Old Testament. The blood of Christ 
cleanses our sin, removes it, and wipes it out so that there is no record 
of it any more. We are cleansed and justified by His blood. God will not 
remember our sin any more (Hebrews 8:12).
Then we read in 1:8, “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.” 
Here, the sin being referred to, is not conscious sin (which every godly 
man  confesses  and  forsakes),  but  to  unconscious  sin,  which  all  of  us  
have. Consider who is writing this verse. John, a man of God, 95 years 
of age, who had walked with God for 65 years. He includes himself here, 
saying, “We”. Did John still have unconscious sin in his life even after 
walking  with  God  for  65  years?  Yes.  Here  is  the  godliest,  holiest  man  
walking on the face of the earth acknowledging that there were still areas 
in his life where he hadn’t become totally like Christ. He was pressing on. 
There will never be a time in our lives when we will be totally free from 
unconscious  sin.  John  was  climbing  a  mountain.  When  he  was  born  
again  he  was  at  the  foot  of  the  mountain.  Becoming  totally  like  Christ  
is the top of the mountain. He had climbed a long way up in 65 years – 
perhaps 70% of the way up. But he still hadn’t reached the top. There was 
still un-Christlikeness in him in certain areas, which he was unaware of. 
He is not referring here to anger, bitterness, lust, adultery and sins like 
that. He had finished with all of that when he had reached 100 feet up 
the  mountain.  Now  he  was  past  20,000  feet  up  and  was  dealing  with  
other sins, which younger believers don’t even consider as sin!
The  Christian  life  is  a  struggle  at  every  stage.  The  second-standard  
student struggles with mathematics. It is multiplication that is difficult 
for  him.  The  Ph.D.  student  also  struggles  with  mathematics.  But  he  
is  struggling  at  a  far  higher  level.  Both  students  are  struggling,  but  at  
different levels. The Christian life is like that. At every stage, it is a strug-
gle. It is a struggle when we have climbed just 500 feet of the mountain, 
and it is a struggle after we reach 20,000 feet as well, because there will 
be unconscious sin (un-Christlike areas) in our lives until the very end 

No Darkness in Him                                                                                                                                  949
1 John
– until the day when Christ returns and we become fully like Him. There 
is more sin within our flesh than we imagine. As we walk in the light 
with God, we get light on those unconscious sins, little by little, and we 
“cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and perfect holi-
ness in the fear of God” (2 Corinthians 7:1). But until the end of our life 
on earth, we will have to admit that there is still sin in us.
In 1:9, we read a clear promise: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful 
and  righteous  to  forgive  us  our  sin,  and  to  cleanse  us  from  all  unright-
eousness.” To whom should we confess our sins? There is a lot of false 
teaching among some Christians (and also in cultistic groups) that says 
that  we  must  confess  our  private  sins  to  other  believers  and  even  in  
public! Such teaching is a demonic doctrine. Sin must be confessed only 
in the circle in which it was committed. For example, if you have a dirty 
thought, only God is in that circle. So you confess such sins only to God. 
If  however  you  have  hurt  another  person,  then  there  are  two  persons  
in  that  circle  –  God  and  that  other  person.  Then  you  must  confess  to  
God as well as to the other person. If you have hurt a church, then you 
must confess to God and to the whole church publicly. You don’t have to 
confess your sins to anyone outside that circle. Remember this – and it 
will save you from a lot of the foolishness going on in Christendom today.
Pastors  in  some  groups  are  trying  to  control  their  congregations  by  
making  people  confess  their  private  sins  in  public.  Then  when  they  
know all about a person’s past life, that man can never leave the group 
because they could blackmail him saying, “We know all about your past 
life. If you don’t want us to tell others about it, stay with us!” There are 
many  wicked  leaders  like  that  in  Christendom  today.  They  will  quote  
James 5:16, “Confess your sins to one another” to justify their teaching. 
But that verse is referring to someone who became sick due to some sin 
and confessing that sin privately in the presence of his church-elders in 
order to be healed. It is not talking about public confession of sin at all.
God is faithful. He will forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteous-
ness. And if we say we have not sinned, then we make Him a liar (1:10). 
1:8 and 1:10 are referring to two different things altogether. 1:8 is refer-
ring to unconscious sin within our flesh, whereas 1:10  is  referring  to  
having sinned in the past.
Then in 2:1, John goes on to say. “These things I am writing to you so 
that you should not sin.” That is the first word: We should not sin. Only 
after having said that, does John refer to what we should do, when we 
do sin. That is the balance found in Scripture: We should not sin, but 
we may sin. “And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, 
Jesus Christ the righteous.”
Why is Jesus Christ called the righteous? Because many advocates are 
liars. Jesus Christ is not. Jesus Christ won’t tell a lie. He will help you if 

950 Through the Bible: Light and Love – Life and Fellowship
1 John
you speak the truth. He is a righteous Advocate. He is on your side. But 
if you want Him to help you, you must speak the truth. Don’t tell a lie. 
Don’t pretend that you have not sinned. Don’t pretend that you are holy 
when you are not. Acknowledge your sin and He will forgive you. He will 
support you. He will defend you. He is an Advocate on your side but a 
righteous Advocate. He hates all hypocrisy.
Consider  if  John  had  written  2:1  with  the  second  sentence  coming  
first, like this: “My little children, if anyone sins we have an Advocate with 
the  Father,  Jesus  Christ  the  righteous,  but  I  am  writing  to  you  that  you  
may  not  sin.”  Do  you  think  that  would  have  made  a  difference?  Yes.  It  
would have made a great difference because then the primary emphasis 
would have been on the fact that you will, of course, sin. But you should 
try not to sin. But that’s not how John put it. The emphasis is first of all 
on “Do NOT sin.” Then secondarily, if you fall, here is what you can do. 
So, John is saying that we don’t have to fall into sin. We can overcome.
If  we  are  learning  mountain-climbing,  the  instructor  won’t  first  tell 
us, “Well, of course you are going to fall and break some bones.” No. He 
will teach us how to climb to the top without falling. Then he will tell us 
what to do if we do fall. When preachers teach “What to do when you sin” 
first, then they are encouraging unbelief. They should be preaching, “You 
should not sin,” first. And then teach what to do if people fall into sin. 
That is the right way.
2:2 tells us clearly that Christ died for the sins “of the whole world”. 
This goes completely against those who teach that Christ died only for 
the sins of the elect. Scripture is clear. Christ died for everyone in the 
world. But only those benefit from His death who accept His offer of 
forgiveness. 
In 2:3, we are told how we know that we have come to know Jesus. By 
keeping His commandments. If you say that you know Him and you don’t 
keep His commandments, you are a liar (2:4). Obeying God’s command-
ments is one of the main themes of 1 John. Another main theme is loving 
our fellow-believers.
2:6 is one of the most important verses in this letter, that all Christians 
must take seriously: “Anyone who says he is a Christian should live as 
Christ  lived”  (Living).  We  are  not  to  walk  as  other  people  walk  but  as  
Jesus walked. We must not excuse our sins by saying “After all, we are 
only  human”.  No.  We  are  to  walk  as  Jesus  walked.  We  cannot  become 
like Christ now. John makes it clear that that will take place only when 
Christ returns (3:2). But walking is a conscious act. So walking as Jesus 
did relates only to the conscious area of our lives. The unconscious part 
of us will remain un-Christlike in many areas until He returns. But in 
our conscious area, we can walk as Jesus did. The unconscious part will 
become totally Christlike when He returns.

Three Stages of the Christian Life                                                                                                          951
1 John
Then John speaks about loving our brothers – another great theme of 
his  letter.  One  who  hates  his  brother  is  still  in  darkness;  but  one  who  
loves his brother abides in the light (2:9).
Three Stages of the Christian Life
Then,  in  2:12–14,  John  writes  about  three  stages  in  the  Christian  life,  
spiritual babyhood, spiritual youth and spiritual maturity. 
Babes are those who know only the forgiveness of their sins and that 
God  has  become  their  Father.  These  are  two  things  that  all  babes  in  
Christ must know. That is the foundation and the starting point of the 
Christian life. You can’t grow if you don’t start on this clear foundation. 
The  next  level  of  maturity  is  when  we  learn  how  to  have  God’s  Word  
abiding permanently in our hearts so that we are strong and can over-
come Satan (2:13, 14). From there, we must grow and become spiritual 
fathers  to  others.  They  know  God  and  His  ways  intimately  –  which  is  
more than just knowing Him as their Father. When you become mature, 
you know God personally, the values He has and the principles by which 
He works, etc. Such fathers can guide other believers – and that is the 
greatest need of the hour in our churches today.
Those  who  only  talk  about  the  forgiveness  of  sins  and  how  God  is  a  
good Father Who cares for all their earthly needs and heals their sick-
nesses and provides for them, are babies. They are like babies who keep 
saying, “Mamma, Dadda”. We all begin there. But we must not remain in 
that state. We must grow up and learn how to fight Satan. Then we have 
to go beyond even that. We must go on to know God intimately. That is 
the greatest thing of all. Then we can be a blessing to many in the church 
as “fathers”.
To all these believers who are at different levels of maturity, John gives 
an exhortation: “Don’t love the world or the things in the world” (2:15). Do 
spiritual fathers also need an exhortation not to love the world? Yes. Even 
the most mature Christian in the world is in danger of loving the world at 
any time. So even he needs the exhortation, “Don’t love the world. If you 
love the world, you cannot love the Father.”
There are three things mentioned here that constitute what John calls 
“the world”: the lust of the flesh – sexual passions, overeating, laziness; 
the lust of the eyes – the desire to buy everything that we see, which is 
related  to  the  love  of  money;  and  pride  –  the  greatest  sin  of  all.  These  
three  things  characterise  this  world  system.  Anyone  who  loves  any  of  
these things cannot love the Father. But all these and the world will pass 
away very soon. Only the one who does the will of the Father will remain 
forever (2:17). That is something we must always bear in mind.
Then  John  goes  on  to  speak  about  the  spirit  of  the  Antichrist.  The  
Antichrist is one who will rise up in the last days. But there were already 
people with the spirit of that antichrist in the church in the first century. 

952 Through the Bible: Light and Love – Life and Fellowship
1 John
2 Thessalonians 2 tells us that that the Antichrist will sit in the temple as 
god. There are people sitting in the church today who act like God. One 
mark of such people is that they love to rule over other believers. They 
do not have the spirit of a servant that Jesus had. They are anti-Christs 
(= the opposite of Jesus Christ). Another mark of such people is that they 
never ask forgiveness from anyone – just as God never has to ask forgive-
ness  from  anyone.  These  people  act  as  if  they  never  make  a  mistake.  
These  are  the  antichrists  in  the  church  today.  Don’t  ever  imagine  that  
you will come to such a place of maturity that you will never again make 
a mistake. As far as I am concerned, I know that I will have to ask forgive-
ness from people until the end of my life, because I anticipate that I will 
be making mistakes until the day I leave this earth. You and I will make 
mistakes. We must humble ourselves before God and men and acknowl-
edge that we are not God – and we must be ready to ask forgiveness from 
the lowest and the least person on earth.
The  antichrists  were  already  there  in  the  first-century  church.  But 
John’s preaching was so powerful that those antichrists were driven out. 
The  preaching  in  the  church  must  be  so  powerful  that  the  antichrists  
must get offended and go somewhere else where all the other antichrists 
congregate. We need some people like John to drive these antichrists from 
the church today. “They went out from us because they didn’t belong with 
us” (2:19). Their spirit didn’t agree with our spirit. John goes on to say, 
“You must discern that through the anointing. The anointing will teach you 
all things” (2:27). You don’t need John or any apostle to come and teach 
you, because you have the Holy Spirit to show you what spirit another 
person has.
Purifying Ourselves
In 3:1,  John  speaks  about  the  Father’s  great  love  that  enables  us  to  
be  His  children!  But  we  still  don’t  know  what  we  are  going  to  become,  
because we don’t see that very clearly right now (3:2). Many are curious 
about the future life. But even John at 95 says he is not very clear about 
it. So it is best not to speculate about such things.
We don’t know many things about the future. But we do know how we 
are supposed to live on this earth now. And we also know this about 
the future that when Christ appears we who are children of God will 
be like Him (3:2). If we really have this hope within us, we will purify 
ourselves  as  Jesus  is  pure.  How  can  we  know  that  the  hope  of  the  
second coming of Christ is a living hope within us and not a dead one? 
Here is the proof: Knowing that we will be like Him when He comes, we 
will keep on purifying ourselves, keeping Jesus’ total purity as our goal. 
In 1:7, John tells us how Jesus purifies us from our past sins through 
His blood. But here John tells us how we must purify ourselves. That 

Purifying Ourselves                                                                                                                                   953
1 John
is the balance that we see in the Scriptures – He purifies us and we 
purify ourselves.
John defines sin here as lawlessness (breaking God’s commandments). 
And  then  he  tells  us  that  Jesus  appeared  on  earth  to  accomplish  two  
things: 
1. To take away our sin (3:5), and
2. To destroy the works of the devil (3:8).
Let me use an illustration to make this plain. When we were born on 
earth, imagine that we were given a large beautiful ball of thread, neatly 
rolled up. We began untying this ball as we grew up and tied it into numer-
ous knots through our sins. Now that we have lived many years, this ball 
of thread has got a million knots in it – and as we look at it, we are thor-
oughly  discouraged  and  wish  we  could  start  life  all  over  again.  But  we  
know that is impossible. Jesus has come to “untie” the works of the devil 
and to give us back a neat ball of thread once again. Isn’t that wonder-
ful? I praise God that He can deal with all the wretched mistakes we have 
made in our lives and again give us hope for the future. He can still make 
something good out of our life. We read in a parable (that Jesus spoke) 
that even those who came to work in the eleventh hour got a reward. So 
even  if  you  have  wasted  90%  of  your  life  (11  hours  out  of  12),  you  can  
come to the Lord now – and He will still make something good out of the 
rest of your life. Thus even older people who have lived most of their life in 
sin, have hope. What an encouragement that is. Praise the Lord!
In 3:9, John says, “No one who is born of God practises sin.” What that 
means is that when we are truly born again (born of God) we won’t keep 
on committing sin. If you keep on committing sin consciously, then it is 
quite likely that you are not born again. A person who is born again may 
slip up occasionally, but he won’t choose to keep on committing sin. That 
is how we distinguish between the children of God and the children of the 
devil (3:10). There we see that there are only two categories of people in 
the world – children of God and children of the devil.
Then John speaks about love in 3:12. He warns us not to be “like Cain 
who hated his brother.” Cain killed his brother, because Cain’s deeds were 
evil while his brother’s were righteous. Cain was an evil man – and that 
was why his offering was not accepted. Abel was a righteous man – and 
that was why his offering was accepted. The Bible says that the Lord had 
regard for Abel first and only then for his offering. And the Lord did not 
have any regard for Cain and that was why his offering was not accepted. 
(Read Genesis 4:4 and 5 carefully). However good your offering may be, 
if your heart is not right with God, He will not accept your offering. And 
then  John  says,  “Don’t  be  surprised  if  the  world  hates  you”  –  as  Cain  
hated Abel. The world hates those whom God approves of. And because 
we stand against the spirit of this world, the world naturally hates us.

954 Through the Bible: Light and Love – Life and Fellowship
1 John
In 3:16,  John  gives  us  one  proof  that  God’s  love  is  dwelling  in  our  
hearts: “We know love by this that He laid down His life for us – and we 
ought to lay down our life for the brethren.” Many people know John 3:16. 
But they don’t know 1 John 3:16. John 3:16 tells us about Jesus laying 
down His life for us. 1 John 3:16 says that because of that, we must be 
willing to lay down our lives for our brothers as well. This is the balance 
we find in the teaching of Scripture: He laid down His life for us. We must 
lay down our life for our brothers. Our love should be shown not in words 
but  in  deeds.  We  should  always  be  ready  to  help  our  fellow-believers  
when they are in need of food and clothing. He is referring here to born-
again brothers who lack the basic necessities of life – and not to selfish 
believers who seek to take advantage of the kindness of other believers to 
get money from them to buy luxuries!
John then goes on to speak about our heart condemning us. “In what-
ever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart and knows 
all things” (3:20). That means that if your conscience itself is convicting 
you about sin, you can imagine how much more sin there is in your life 
that God sees? You see only 10%, God sees 100%. But we don’t have to 
be disturbed about that unconscious area of our lives that God alone 
can see, because God holds us responsible only for the area that we can 
see. It is enough if you keep your conscience clear – that 10% that you 
can see and God will cleanse the rest as we saw in 1:7. So if our heart 
does not condemn us, then we can have confidence in prayer. This 
teaches us that one of the most important requirements for answered 
prayer is a clear conscience. Whatever we ask we can receive because 
to the best of our knowledge we are keeping His commandments and 
doing the things that are pleasing to Him (3:22).
Next  John  warns  us  not  to  believe  every  spirit  that  operates  among  
Christians but to test all of them (4:1). This is one of the most needed 
warnings in our day. We must test all the supernatural manifestations 
going on in Christendom today and not blindly accept everything super-
natural as coming from God. We must check every preacher’s message 
with the Word of God and test his methods with the methods of Jesus 
and the apostles. For example, Jesus did not collect money from people, 
before  or  after  healing  anyone,  or  before  or  after  preaching  anywhere.  
Jesus  never  asked  anyone  who  was  healed  to  come  before  the  people  
and  give  a  testimony.  The  methods  adopted  by  today’s  preachers  are  
totally different from the methods used by Jesus. And so we must expose 
this  deception  that  is  deceiving  so  many  Christians.  And  the  so-called  
“ healings” nowadays are all so superficial and so shallow.
But some will say, “Don’t speak against the Holy Spirit.” But the Holy 
Spirit  says  here,  “Test  every  spirit”  (4:1).  And  that  is  what  we  must  all  
do. When someone makes a babbling noise we should not automatically 

Obedience, Love and Christ’s Humanity                                                                                               955
1 John
believe that that is “a message in tongues”, as most Pentecostals believe. 
We  must  test  the  spirit.  We  must  check  whether  it  was  edifying  and  a  
blessing to the church. In 95% of cases, I have found such tongues to be 
fake. In most cases it is just a psychologically-produced outburst. Even 
demons  can  make  a  person  speak  in  tongues.  Only  5%  of  what  I  have  
heard has been genuine tongues. Test the spirits. If it is of God, it will 
edify you, it will lift your spirit up and bless you. But if it is not of God, it 
will be like a “heavy wet blanket” upon the meeting. So we must always 
test every spirit.
Obedience, Love and Christ’s Humanity
In 4:2, we read another of the great themes of 1 John: “Every spirit that 
confesses that Jesus has come in the flesh is of God.” Three of the great 
themes  of  1  John  are  –  obedience  to  God’s  commandments,  loving  one  
another and confessing that Jesus came in our flesh.
Remember that John has watched the development of the church for 
65  years.  And  what  he  is  saying  now  is  that  if  you  want  to  build  the  
church the way God wants it to be built, then these three matters must 
be emphasised: Obedience to God’s commandments, love for one another 
and the humanity of Jesus Christ. Are these three subjects being empha-
sised in your church? If not, it will not be built as the Body of Christ.
In 4:4, John encourages believers by saying, “You are from God, little 
children. He that is in you is greater than he that is in the world.” That’s 
why we can be overcomers at all times and why we need never be afraid 
of the devil or of anyone else in the world.
After that, John comes back to the theme of loving one another, which 
he says is the primary mark of a person who knows God (4:7, 8).
In 4:12, John repeats what he had earlier said in his gospel as well: “No 
one has seen God at any time.” This statement is found only twice in 
the Bible. In John 1:18 and here. When we put both these passages of 
Scripture together, we learn a great truth. John 1:18 says: “No one has 
seen God at any time, but Jesus came and showed people what God is 
like.” Here, in 1 John 4:12, it says, “Now that Jesus has gone back to 
heaven,  the  world  can  see  what  God  is  like  in  us  believers,  when  we  
love one another.” The world still has not seen God. But God has placed 
His church here so that people see what He is like. When Jesus was 
here on earth, He was the Body of Christ. People saw God in Jesus. 
Now we (the church) are the Body of Christ. People must see God in us. 
That is why we must love one another. As we seek for the life of God 
and fellowship with Him and one another, we will manifest through our 
lives that God is both light and love.
When Jesus was on earth He said, “If you have seen Me you have seen 
the Father” (John 14:9). Today we as the Body of Christ should be able to 

956 Through the Bible: Light and Love – Life and Fellowship
1 John
say, “If you have seen us you have seen a little bit of what Jesus is like, a 
little bit of what heaven is like. If you live in my home, you will see a little 
bit of what heaven is like. If you fellowship with me you will taste a little bit 
of what Jesus is like and a little bit of what heaven is like”. That should be 
our testimony. If that is not our testimony, then we have to acknowledge 
that we have failed God. We can preach, evangelise and teach the Bible, 
but if we do not manifest the life and love of God in our daily lives, our 
testimony is a failure. Because then the people around us still haven’t 
seen what God is like in us. That is the tragedy in Christendom today.
In 4:17, John goes on further, to say, “As Jesus is, so we are in this 
world.”  This  is  an  amazing  verse.  We  are  called  to  be  as  Jesus  in  this  
world.  This  also  means  that  we  can  have  authority  over  Satan  just  as  
Jesus  had.  Do  you  believe  that?  That  is  the  only  way  we  can  live  with  
dignity, boldness and confidence as we face the future. This is a verse 
that I would like to put in front of every wholehearted child of God: “As 
Jesus is, so are you in this world.” Live with that authority and don’t ever 
live in any fear. We will have no fear when we realise how much God loves 
us (4:18). Fear can come in only when we think that God wants to punish 
us for something. But there is no fear when we recognise that God loves 
us immensely. And we love the Lord in return because He first loved us 
(4:19). The more we recognise how much Jesus loved us, the more our 
love will grow for Him – spontaneously. Perfect love casts out fear.
But no-one can say that he loves God if he hates any brother in Christ. 
Such a person is not a believer but a liar (4:20). Here it is referring to 
a brother “whom you can see” (4:20). It is easy to love believers whom 
you never see – like the ones living in far-off lands. But it is the brother 
and  sister  who  you  meet  regularly  who  tests  whether  you  love  God  
or not.
In 5:4,  John  boldly  says  that  everyone  “born  of  God  overcomes  the  
world”. He goes on to say that it is by faith that we overcome the world – 
by our faith in the fact that God loves us and that all that Jesus revealed 
about God is true. Thus we overcome the attractions of this world easily. 
It is when believers don’t believe everything that Jesus said that they find 
the world very attractive – and are overcome by its temptations.
Before John closes his letter, he once again assures every true believer 
that  he  “has  eternal  life”  (5:13).  And  he  also  assures  them  that  when  
they pray for anything according to the will of God, their prayers will be 
heard and answered by God (5:14). We must live with that confidence in 
our Father, that He delights to give us everything that is good for us, in 
answer to prayer. If at times His answer is “No”, He still answered our 
prayer – but the answer was “No”, because He saw that what we asked 
for was not for our good.

1 John
In 5:16,  John  urges  us  to  pray  for  believers  who  we  see  committing  
some sin, so that God can deliver them from death and lead them to life. 
Then John says that we should not pray if we sense that the sin is one 
that will lead to death. This probably refers to a sin like the one Ananias 
and Sapphira committed, for which there was no use praying for them. 
They had to die. We may ask how we can know which sin is which. The 
answer to that is that if Gods gives you a responsibility of eldership like 
He  gave  Peter,  He  will  give  you  the  discernment  to  know  which  sin  is  
which. I have used that promise many times. I see somebody committing 
a sin which I don’t believe is serious. I pray for him and I have seen God 
giving him life.
In 5:19,  John  states  that  the  whole  world  is  lying  under  the  power  
of Satan. Most believers don’t believe this. If we believe it, we will be 
careful in dealing with everything in this world – its financial system, 
its educational system, its fashions, its entertainments, its music and 
its entire value system – for it has all been poisoned by Satan.
John’s concluding word is: “Little children, guard yourselves from idols” 
(5:21). That means, “Give up everything in your life that hinders God from 
having first place in your life”. Amen.



2 JOHN
Jesus Christ Came in the Flesh
T
he  second  letter  of  John  is  a  very  brief  letter,  and  there  are  two  
things  he  speaks  about  in  this  letter:  Obeying  God’s  command-
ments and a warning against false teachers. He wrote it to one he 
calls here the chosen lady. That could have been a godly widow who had 
God-fearing  children  whom  John  sought  to  encourage.  But  even  more  
likely, it could have been a church, because he writes a number of things 
here  that  all  churches  need  to  take  heed  to.  In  1:4,  John  says,  “I  was  
very glad to find some of your children walking in truth just as we have 
received commandment from the Father.” That’s a great testimony when a 
widow has brought up her children to walk in the truth in such a way as 
to get commended by an apostle.
Walk in Love and Truth
In 1:5, John reverts once again to his most favourite exhortation: “Love 
one  another.”  Notice  how  this  comes  through  in  all  of  John’s  writings.  
John was living at a time when the Christian testimony was in decline 
in  many  churches.  Spirituality  was  disappearing  everywhere  and  very  
few elders and churches were standing up for the truth uncompromis-
ingly. In Revelation chapters 2 and 3, we see that only two churches out 
of  seven  were  spiritually-minded.  John  could  see  the  causes  for  their  
failure.  John  writes  as  an  apostle  inspired  by  the  Holy  Spirit  to  rectify  
the problems in these churches. Peter went out and did evangelism. Paul 
went out and built up the churches. John at the end of the first century, 
is correcting the problems in the churches, emphasising the essentials.
John’s  emphasis  is:  Love  one  another,  but  not  at  the  cost  of  truth.  
Don’t love one another in a human way that compromises the truth, but 
walk in the truth and love one another. And then he again talks about 
the deceivers. “Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who 

960 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ Came in the Flesh
2 John
don’t acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.” Notice again 
in 1:6, 7, John’s three-fold emphasis: “Obey God’s commandments; love 
one another; confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh”. Even in a short 
letter  like  this,  he  brings  out  these  three  points.  That  teaches  us  how  
important these three matters are: We must teach people to obey all of 
God’s  commandments,  and  to  love  one  another  and  that  Jesus  came  
in the flesh (because of which He was tempted like us but did not sin). 
A person who does not confess these is a deceiver and antichrist.
There are two truths concerning Jesus that a Spirit-filled believer will 
confess: That He is fully God and fully Man. The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 
12:3,  “No  one  can  confess  that  Jesus  Christ  is  Lord  except  by  the  Holy  
Spirit.” Jesus is the Lord Jehovah of the Old Testament. The Bible also 
says in 1 John 4:2: “By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that 
confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God”. Both these 
truths are important. But notice that John emphasises the second one 
more than the first. All true Christians acknowledge that Jesus Christ is 
God, the Jehovah of the Old Testament.
Jesus Christ in the Flesh – Our Spiritual Dictionary
But  all  Christians  don’t  sufficiently  emphasise  the  second  truth  that 
Jesus Christ came in the flesh.  The  implication  of  Jesus  having  come  
“in the flesh”  is  that  He  could  therefore  be  tempted  exactly  as  we  are,  
in every point (Hebrews 4:15). Some Christians are so blind as to think 
that  the  fact  that  Jesus  was  tempted  like  us  is  a  false  teaching!  John  
however says the very opposite. He says that a Christian inspired by the 
Holy Spirit confesses that Jesus came in the flesh; whereas one who does 
not confess this has got the spirit of the Antichrist – which is the spirit 
of continuing to live in sin. But many Christians have gone so far from 
this  truth  that  they  think  that  it  is  the  one  who  confesses  that  Jesus  
came in the flesh who has the spirit of the antichrist. This is the state of 
Christendom today – exactly as it was at the end of the first century. 
If you want to speak God’s prophetic word to backslidden Christendom 
today, do you know what it should be? Read John’s epistle: 
1. Obey God’s commandments;
2. Love one another; and
3. Confess that Jesus came in the flesh. 
This is the finest 3-point sermon you can preach to Christians for the 
rest of your life. The first two of these are dependent on the third.
Now  that  Christ  has  demonstrated  how  to  live  an  overcoming  life  in  
human flesh, we have no excuse for not obeying God’s commandments 
or for not loving another. Jesus was tempted like us in these two areas 
– but He did not sin. He kept all of God’s commandments and He loved 
others. So why can’t we?

Jesus Christ in the Flesh – Our Spiritual Dictionary                                                                            961
2 John
Why does God allow deceivers to come into Christendom and preach 
against  this  truth?  So  that  our  discerning  faculties  as  Christians  can  
be sharpened and so that we become mature. Many examinations these 
days are conducted with questions having ‘multiple choices’ for answers. 
Below  the  question  there  will  be  four  answers  for  you  from  which  you  
must choose the right one. Three of those answers will be wrong. Thus 
your discernment is sharpened. If a question had only one answer (the 
right one) given below it, then everyone would get 100%. Then the exam-
iner will not be able to discover who has discernment and who doesn’t. 
So  in  physics  or  chemistry,  you  will  really  need  to  know  the  subjects  
well to pick the right answer. In the same way, God allows deception in 
the church as well. There are a hundred different teachings about any 
subject in Christendom. Only one of them is right. The other 99 are all 
wrong. The Lord says, “Pick the right one.” Some of the 99 false teachings 
appear to be right. But the one with discernment will recognise that they 
are  false.  Those  who  love  the  truth  will  not  be  deceived,  as  we  read  in  
2 Thessalonians 2:10, 11.
If you have seen that Jesus came in the flesh – and its implications 
for you – you will not be deceived. I have personally been protected thus 
from many a deception.
Let  me  give  you  one  example:  Nowadays  there  are  many  preachers  
who claim to have the supernatural gift of healing the sick. How can we 
know whether a particular preacher and his healing methods are from 
God or not? We may not know anything about his personal life. And we 
don’t have to test him with many verses of Scripture. “Jesus came in the 
flesh” is the only test required. Jesus in the flesh healed thousands of 
sick people. Compare that preacher and his methods with Jesus in the 
flesh. Immediately you can know whether he is from God or not.
For example, if he is interested in collecting money at his meetings, is 
he from God or is he a deceiver? Ask yourself, “When Jesus was in the 
flesh, was He interested in collecting money from the people – either 
for  Himself  or  for  His  ministry?”  Never.  Then  we  know  immediately  
that this preacher is a deceiver, whatever wonderful truths he may be 
preaching and even if one or two people are healed in his meetings.
Or here is another preacher who preaches, “If you really believe in God 
you  will  be  financially  wealthy”  –  quoting  some  old-covenant  promise 
like Deuteronomy  28:11.  Jesus  also  knew  Deuteronomy  28:11.  But  did  
Jesus in the flesh ever teach financial prosperity to His disciples from 
that verse? The answer is “No”. Then you discern immediately that this 
preacher is also a deceiver. No deceiver in the world can fool you once you 
have seen Jesus having come in the flesh.
“Jesus Christ in the flesh” must now become our spiritual dictionary. 
What  do  I  mean  by  that?  When  we  don’t  know  a  word  in  English,  we  

962 Through the Bible: Jesus Christ Came in the Flesh
2 John
pick up a dictionary and look up the meaning of the word there. We may 
imagine that the word means something else. But we acknowledge that 
the  dictionary  is  always  right.  We  can  adopt  the  same  principle  in  the  
Christian life as well. For example, we see many things going on today in 
the name of “Holy-Spirit power”. We don’t know which is right and which 
is  wrong.  Let  us  go  to  the  spiritual  dictionary:  “Jesus,  the  Word  made  
flesh” – and check up. In the four gospels, we see the things that Jesus 
did and said when He was in the flesh. So  when  we  see  people  today  
falling down and laughing, roaring like lions and barking like dogs and 
saying that those are manifestations of the Holy Spirit, we don’t have to 
be confused. Let us just look at Jesus in the flesh and see whether He 
ever lay down on the floor and kicked His legs in the air or laughed or 
roared like a lion, etc. No. Then we know that all those manifestations 
are not of the Holy Spirit. We don’t need to know the whole Bible to have 
discernment on these matters. In the first century, most Christians did 
not have a Bible. But those who were filled with the Holy Spirit had Jesus 
revealed to them by the Spirit. And so they could see through false teach-
ings quite easily.
Abide in the Teaching of Christ
In 1:8, John warns us, “Watch yourselves, be careful.” Be careful that you 
do not lose your full reward, by being led astray by all these deceptions in 
Christendom today. By the grace of God, I have served the Lord for more 
than forty years in India and the Lord has planted churches – and I can 
say without any hesitation, that the truth that has led me and preserved 
me all these years is this that Jesus came in the flesh and was tempted 
like me but did not sin.
Look at Jesus and follow His example – and you will never be deceived. 
You don’t have to criticise or judge the deceiving preachers. Leave them 
alone. God will judge them all one day. They are blind leaders of the blind 
and they and their followers will end up in the pit finally. So don’t judge 
them – and don’t follow them.
In 1:9, John warns: “If anyone goes too far and does not abide in the 
teaching of Christ...”. That is referring to those who go beyond what Jesus 
taught and beyond what the Word of God teaches on this subject. Here 
is  one  example.  The  Bible  says  that  Jesus  did  not  come  in  sinful flesh 
but only in “the likeness” of sinful flesh (Romans 8:3). But some foolish 
Christians in a false zeal for this doctrine, “go too far” and say that Jesus 
must have had sinful lusts in His flesh if He was to be tempted like us. 
Like psychologists, they try to analyse the inner life of Jesus (which none 
of  us  can  do)  and  thus  teach  error.  They  are  like  the  people  of  Beth-
shemesh who “looked inside the ark” and were killed by God for their lack 
of  reverence  (1  Samuel  6:19).  John  says  that  such  people  “do  not  have  
God”. We must stop where Scripture stops. “The secret things belong to 

Abide in the Teaching of Christ                                                                                                               963
2 John
the  LORD  our  God,  but  the  things  revealed  belong  to  us”  (Deuteronomy 
29:29). We must stop with the things that are clearly revealed and not “go 
too far” into foolish speculations. Beware of trying to be “super-spiritual”. 
In 1:10, 11, John says, “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this 
teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not give him a  greeting 
– for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds”. The 
apostle  of  love  speaks  very  strongly  against  false  teachers.  Those  who  
belong to the Jehovah’s Witnesses cult openly declare that Jesus Christ 
is not God but a created being. They go, two by two, from house to house, 
in  many  lands  and  deceive  people.  John  says  that  we  should  not  even  
receive them into our house or give them a greeting saying, “God bless 
you” – because God cannot bless those who dishonour the Lord Jesus. 
Anyone  who  gives  them  a  greeting  is  participating  in  their  evil  deeds,  
says John. So, don’t think it is Christian love to show hospitality to such 
deceivers.
Stand true to the Lord in these days of deception.



3 JOHN
A Bad Elder and a Good Elder
T
his letter tells us about a good elder and a bad elder. The good elder 
is  Demetrius  (1:12)  and  the  bad  elder  is  Diotrephes  (1:9).  It  also  
teaches us some fundamental principles of serving God – especially 
in relation to money. This letter was written to a brother named Gaius. 
Deception of the Prosperity Gospel
In  1:2,  when  John  says, “Beloved,  I  pray  that  in  all  respects  you  may  
prosper  and  be  in  good  health,  just  as  your  soul  prospers”,  he  is  only  
saying what we would all say in a letter to a friend, “I hope your business 
is doing well and that you are keeping good health.” But this verse has 
been misinterpreted by those who preach the “health-wealth” gospel as 
though God Himself were speaking through it to all believers everywhere 
saying that He wants all of them to be financially wealthy and never sick 
at any time. It is easy for people to “read into” Bible-verses whatever they 
want it to mean – and this is a classic example of such foolishness.
As we said in our last study, whenever in doubt about the meaning of 
a verse, go to the spiritual dictionary – Jesus in the flesh. Was Jesus a 
rich Man? Not at all. He Himself said that at times He did not even have a 
place to lay His head. To prove a point once, He had to borrow a coin. He 
didn’t have one Himself. To pay His taxes, He had to send Peter to catch 
a fish and get a coin out of its mouth. That clearly proves that financial 
wealth is not the will of God for all His children. And so that is obviously 
not the meaning of this verse.
Did Jesus have health to do God’s will? Yes. But the Bible also says 
that He was “familiar with sickness” (Isaiah 53:3 - Literal translation). We 
need health to do God’s will. But Jesus never taught that His servants 
would never get sick. Paul and Timothy were some of His greatest serv-
ants in the first century. Yet the Lord did not heal Paul but allowed him 

966 Through the Bible: A Bad Elder and a Good Elder
3 John
to live with “a thorn in his flesh” (2 Corinthians 12:7). Timothy had to live 
with his “stomach’s frequent ailments” (1 Timothy 5:23).
So we see that our “spiritual dictionary” delivers us from false teachings.
1:4 is a wonderful verse: “I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my 
children are walking in the truth.” This is what every father and spiritual 
father (church-elder) should have as his greatest joy. Even many Christian 
fathers unfortunately find their greatest joy in knowing that their child-
ren are earning a good salary. John’s greatest joy was in knowing that 
those whom he had ministered to, were walking uprightly.
In 2  John,  we  saw  how  John  warns  us  not  even  to  receive  certain  
people into our homes. But here he says how we must show hospitality 
to  certain  other  people.  Gaius  was  acting  faithfully  when  he  welcomed  
brothers to stay in his home – even though he was meeting some of them 
for the very first time. There were brothers in those days travelling from 
place to place preaching the gospel, and they usually received hospital-
ity from the believers in each locality. We have to be careful however as 
to  who  we  allow  to  stay  in  our  homes  –  for  there  are  many  wandering  
preachers who seek to take advantage of the hospitality of believers. So 
the  practice  in  those  days  was  for  a  known  brother  to  introduce  such  
preachers with a letter to the home where they stayed.
John goes on to recommend that Gaius should send such preachers 
on their onward journey in the ministry “in a manner worthy of God.” In 
today’s  terms,  that  would  mean  getting  them  a  ticket  for  their  onward  
journey  and  providing  them  money  for  their  food  and  travel  expenses.  
There were no salaried preachers in the first century. That bad habit 
started  much  later  in  Christendom.  But  in  those  early  days,  the  true  
servants of God whom God had called to serve Him went forth trusting 
God for their needs. And money didn’t drop down from heaven for them. 
It was given to them by other believers. But they did not ask or beg for 
money. They trusted God to move people’s hearts to provide them what 
they needed, as they went forth seeking God’s kingdom first and preach-
ing the gospel.
God’s Work and Money
We also see in 1:7 that the preachers in those days “received no money 
from non-Christians”. This verse teaches us very clearly, which John had 
observed  for  65  years  in  the  church,  that  no  godly  man  takes  money  
from unbelievers for preaching the gospel. How sadly different it is today 
with Christian preachers who conduct evangelistic meetings. Before they 
preach God’s free salvation to those unbelievers, they pass a collection 
bag in front of them and collect their money. That is like saying to them, 
“Before you listen to the gospel, you had better pay up”. Does that unbe-
liever have to pay before he hears the gospel? What an insult to the Lord 
that is. And what is the money being collected for? The preacher says, 

A Warning Against Rebellion                                                                                                                  967
3 John
“To  support  the  Lord’s  work.”  Are  those  non-Christians  supposed  to  
support the work of the God of heaven? That is the spirit of Babylon and 
not of the true church of God. It is almost impossible nowadays to see a 
Christian public meeting where money is not collected. In fact, collecting 
money is one of the major items in the meeting. But the preachers in the 
first century never took a cent or a paisa from any unbeliever.
To  give  to  support  God’s  work  is  a  privilege  and  an  honour  that  is  
reserved  for  the  children  of  God  alone.  No-one  else  has  that  privilege.  
In  my  own  case,  no  unbeliever  will  be  able  to  stand  before  God  in  the  
final day and say that he ever supported me in my service for the Lord. 
I have consistently refused to receive gifts from unbelievers in all these 
50 years of my full-time Christian service. There are times when unbe-
lievers have sent money to our church. When we know that the sender is 
an unbeliever, we have either returned their money to them graciously, 
explaining our position, or, at times, bought Christian books with that 
money  and  sent  them  the  books  as  gifts.  We  have  refused  to  use  even  
one paisa of such money for the work of the Lord. We have to be utterly 
faithful  to  the  Lord  in  this  matter.  God  has  enough  money  among  His  
people to do His work. He doesn’t want the devil’s money to do His work.
The Bible says that everyone in the world lies in the power of the Evil 
One (1 John 5:19). Those who are not born again are the children of the 
evil one. Does a country ever collect money from an enemy in order to 
fight that enemy? But this is what many foolish preachers are doing. 
They tell an unbeliever that he is a child of the devil; and then tell him, 
“Please  give  me  your  money  so  that  I  can  deliver  you  from  the  devil.”  
That  is  the  height  of  stupidity  and  deception.  But  it  is  being  practised  
by almost every preacher in Christendom – even by those in fundamen-
tal, evangelical groups. They have no light on Biblical principles in the 
use of money, because they haven’t studied the Scriptures. They go and 
study in Bible-colleges, but haven’t read 3 John 7. We must never receive 
money from unbelievers for God’s work. They have no right to support 
God’s work or His servants. If they offer you money, tell them graciously, 
“May God save your soul. But I don’t want your money.” Elisha refused to 
take Naaman’s money, because Naaman was an idol-worshipper. Elisha 
lived  in  a  poor  hut.  But  he  didn’t  want  Naaman’s  money.  His  servant  
Gehazi  however  took  it  –  and  got  Naaman’s  leprosy  along  with  it  and  
passed on that leprosy to his children as well (2 Kings 5). Most Christian 
workers today are like Gehazi, and that is why the prophets of God are 
rare in the world today.
A Warning Against Rebellion
John then writes about Diotrephes, the bad elder. Diotrephes loved to be 
a leader. Many an elder starts out as a humble man. But gradually he 
can come to a place where he becomes big in his own eyes. Diotrephes 

968 Through the Bible: A Bad Elder and a Good Elder
3 John
became so big in his own eyes that he would not even listen to an apostle. 
I  am  sure  that  in  the  early  days,  when  Diotrephes  was  an  unknown  
young  brother,  he  listened  to  John.  But  as  his  ministry  developed  he  
began  to  think,  “Who  does  John  think  he  is?  I  am  also  a  man  of  God.  
God has used me. I have established a church here. I don’t need to listen 
to John any more.” That was Diotrephes’s downfall. Today, he must be 
regretting in hell that he did not listen to the apostle who brought him to 
the faith and taught him everything that he knew about God.
Diotrephes must have sought to displace John’s authority in his church 
by promoting himself before his congregation. Such things happen even 
today. People who have grown up as children under some spiritual father 
suddenly  begin  to  think  that  they  are  somebody  important  and  turn  
against  their  godly  leader.  That’s  exactly  what  the  devil  wants  them  to  
do, because he wants to destroy them finally. “Let him go on doing this 
for ten years”, the Devil says, “and then I will destroy him.”
If you are fortunate enough to have a godly brother as your elder and 
your guide, respect his advice. No matter how much God allows you to 
grow, no matter how much He uses you, humble yourself. That brother 
may not force his authority on you because he is a gracious godly man. 
But  you  will  be  the  loser  if  you  don’t  humble  yourself  and  take  his  
advice. You will be another Diotrephes.
But John does not plan to give up. He cares for the church there and 
so he says, “When I come there, I will point out his sins to all the others.” 
John  was  not  afraid  of  exposing  arrogant  elders  before  the  congrega-
tion. Diotrephes even accused John with wicked words before the church 
(1:10). We see here that even John, the saintliest man on earth at that 
time, was accused by an elder of a church. If you want to serve God you 
will be unjustly accused with wicked words by others.
Diotrephes rejected all the brothers whom John sent to that church. 
And if anyone in the church received those brothers, Diotrephes would 
put that person out of the church (1:10). He would ask him, “Why did 
you receive that brother?, Why did you allow him to stay with you?, Did 
you take my permission?”, etc. Diotrephes was a dictator, not an elder. 
There are dictators like that in many churches today, who seek to control 
their people and not serve them. Don’t ever stay in such a church, for it 
is Babylon, through and through.
The true church of Jesus Christ does not have dictators as its elders. 
Its elders are servants who give freedom to their flock and do not seek to 
run their lives. Such elders have also learnt in humility to submit to the 
spiritual authority God has set over them.
Then John commends Demetrius who has received a good testimony 
from everyone as a good elder. He says that the truth itself bears witness 
to Demetrius as a humble godly man.

JUDE
Contend Earnestly for  
the True Faith
J
ude’s letter is a very brief letter. The subject is “Contending earnestly 
for the faith, and not compromising” (1:3). It deals with false teach-
ing, false teachers and their judgement. We are exhorted to stand 
true to the Lord in the midst of all the compromise around us.
Jude actually wanted to write about salvation (1:3). In other words, he 
wanted to write something like Paul’s letter to the Romans, explaining all 
about our salvation in Christ. But as he began to write he felt the burden 
of the Holy Spirit to write about something completely different. I have 
had that experience too, where I begin to write to a brother about some 
matter,  and  end  up  writing  about  something  totally  different,  because  
the Holy Spirit put another burden on me. When we are in touch with the 
Holy Spirit, such things happen.
True Faith and True Grace
Jude felt a strong burden to appeal to believers to contend earnestly for 
the faith. He felt that was more important at that time than explaining 
the way of salvation. The believers he wrote to already knew about salva-
tion. But now the great need was for them to stand up for the true faith 
in the midst of compromise. This is a great need in Christendom today 
as  well,  because  some  deceivers  have  crept  into  the  church  unnoticed  
(1:4). How did they creep in? Because the elders – the doorkeepers – of 
the church had gone to sleep.
The  Lord  told  Ezekiel  that  He  had  appointed  him  as  a  watchman  in  
Israel.  In  the  same  way,  the  elders  in  a  church  are  appointed  by  the  
Lord to be watchmen. If the watchmen are asleep, the wolves get in. An 
elder  must  be  a  doorkeeper  who  is  spiritually  awake  all  the  time,  and  

970 Through the Bible: Contend Earnestly for the True Faith 
Jude
who checks up on who all are coming to the church-services, why they 
are coming, and why some doubtful person is visiting the brothers, etc. 
People creep in to churches to lead believers astray and to turn the grace 
of God into licence to sin.
Just like one gets a licence to drive a vehicle, in the same way people 
take the grace of God as a licence to commit sin!
They  imagine  thus:  “Now  I  have  my  licence  (grace).  Now  it  doesn’t  
matter how much I sin. God’s grace will always be there to forgive me.” 
Thus  they  misrepresent  the  grace  of  God.  There  are  many  Christians  
who live by that false understanding of grace today. They commit adult-
ery and then say, “David also committed adultery. But he still remained 
as king. So I can still continue in my ministry.” It’s tragic. To them, the 
grace of God has become “permission to sin”!
There is a difference between standards under the old covenant and in 
the new covenant. If Paul had fallen into adultery (like David), Paul would 
never have preached again. He would have gone and done some business 
in Tarshish and sat as a back-bencher in the church there for the rest 
of his life. It is one thing for a young believer to fall into adultery. He can 
repent and one day have a glorious ministry. But it is quite another thing 
for a mature leader to fall into adultery. If Paul had fallen into adultery, 
how could he ever preach again that “sin cannot have dominion over you 
when you are under grace”, (Romans 6:14) and that “God always leads 
us in triumph in Christ” (2 Corinthians 2:14)? So David is not our example 
in the new covenant age. Jesus and Paul are. They are the ones who said 
“Follow me” (Matthew 4:19; 1 Corinthians 11:1).
But is this message of the true grace being preached today? No. The 
grace  of  God  is  being  preached  as  a  licence  to  sin.  These  old  covenant  
preachers say, “So many great leaders in Israel sinned. Samson commit-
ted adultery with so many women and yet he served God.” Such preaching 
of  false  grace  is  leading  Christians  back  to  the  old  covenant.  Then,  it  
becomes as though Jesus never came to earth and as if the Holy Spirit 
never came – for that is how it was under the old covenant!
These preachers preach, “Once saved, always saved. It doesn’t really 
matter how we live now. Our salvation is not by our works but by grace.” 
And  so  Jude  reminds  them  about  what  happened  to  the  people  who  
came  out  of  Egypt.  They  were  symbolically  saved.  But  they  never  
entered Canaan. They perished in the wilderness.
The  example  of  these  Israelites  is  quoted  three  times  in  the  New  
Testament to warn believers. In 1 Corinthians 9:27, Paul says that after 
preaching to others, he could be disqualified himself – and then gives 
the example of the Israelites who came out of Egypt but perished in the 
wilderness (1 Corinthians 10:1–11). He concludes by saying, “Let him who 
thinks  he  stands  take  heed  lest  he  fall”  (1  Corinthians  10:12).  Then  in  

True Faith and True Grace                                                                                                                       971
Jude
Hebrews chapters 3 and 4, the writer says, “Let us fear lest we also fall 
like those Israelites who came out of Egypt.” And Jude says here, “Let us 
fear,  for  the  Lord  afterwards  destroyed  the  people  whom  He  had  saved  
from Egypt” (Jude 1:5). What Jude is basically saying is, “There is no such 
thing as ‘Once saved, always saved.’ ”
Will you preach this message (that Jude writes) in your church – that 
the people whom the Lord once saved He destroyed later on, because they 
lived in sin? The Bible speaks to born-again Christians saying, “Brethren, 
if we live after the flesh, we will die” (Romans 8:13).
Then  Jude  gives  another  example.  The  angels  in  heaven  were  holy.  
But when some of them did not stay within their boundary but went into 
strange sins, God threw them out and “kept them in eternal bonds under 
darkness for the judgment of the great day” (1:6). Then Jude gives a third 
example – Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring towns “indulged 
in  lust  of  every  kind,  including  lust  of  men  for  other  men  and  they  were  
destroyed by fire and they continue to be a warning to us that there is a 
hell in which sinners are punished” (1:7 - Living). The angels came and 
warned these people, but they would not listen. These are all examples 
of  those  whom  God  judged  in  Old  Testament  times.  But  in  spite  of  all  
these warnings, false teachers who make grace a licence for sin, go right 
on living their evil, immoral lives and “reject authority and revile angelic 
authorities” (1:8).
Yet another characteristic of those who live according to the flesh is 
that they reject spiritual authority. They are a law unto themselves and 
won’t  submit  to  anyone.  Maybe  they  did  submit  at  one  time.  But  now  
they  consider  themselves  important  people  and  reject  authority.  Thus  
the devil prepares them for their doom. They even go so far as to make 
fun of the devil. Jesus never made fun of the devil. Satan was defeated 
on the cross. And so we can rebuke him, resist him, stand against him 
and command him to get away in Jesus’ name. And he will flee (James 
4:7).  But  don’t  ever  “scoff  at  him”. Even  the  archangel  Michael  when  
disputing  with  the  devil  about  the  body  of  Moses  did  not  pronounce  a  
judgement against him but merely said, “The Lord rebuke you” (1:9). But 
Jude says, “false teachers sneer at things they don’t understand, and live 
by animal-instinct and thus destroy themselves” (1:10).
When people turn the grace of God into sin they become like animals 
who  follow  their  natural  instincts.  If  their  body  has  a  passion  for  sex,  
they just follow that. On Indian streets, we often see dogs chasing after 
female-dogs  just  to  have  sex  with  them.  Worldly  men  also  follow  after  
girls  in  the  same  way  to  have  sex  with  them.  That  is  to  live  like  dogs.  
And if those who “claim to be God’s children” do that, then they also have 
become  like  unreasoning  animals.  Jude  says,  “Woe  unto  them”  (1:11). 
May a curse be on them. Such people are not children of God at all. They 
should first stop claiming to be Christians and then they can do what 
they like.

Jude
Jealousy, Covetousness and Rebellion
Then  Jude  gives  three  other  examples  from  the  Old  Testament  –  Cain,  
Balaam and Korah.
Cain’s  problem  was  jealousy.  He  was  jealous  of  his  younger  brother  
on whose sacrifice God had sent a fire, accepting it. Are you jealous of a 
brother (perhaps younger than you) in whose life and ministry you see 
a fire and an anointing from God? Then you are following in Cain’s foot-
steps. Whenever you are jealous of anyone, it proves that you don’t love 
him. Elders can be jealous of younger brothers who are anointed and on 
fire and progressing spiritually beyond them. If you are jealous, you are 
in fellowship with the devil. A godly man will encourage such a younger 
brother. He will sit down in a meeting and let the younger brother be the 
main speaker.
Consider  a  father  who  is  an  uneducated  labourer  whose  son  goes  
to  college  and  gets  a  degree.  The  father  goes  to  the  college  to  see  his  
son getting his degree-certificate. Is he jealous of his son, because the 
latter has gone ahead of him educationally? No. Why? Because he is a 
father and he loves his son. If you as an elder in a church are jealous of 
anyone in your church, it is because you are not a father. A true father 
will encourage his son to go on and even get a Ph.D.! I have seen poor 
labourers  who  are  happy  to  see  their  children  well-educated.  But  it  is  
rare to see an elder who is eager to push his younger brothers forward 
like that. Instead, I have seen elders who sit on their thrones and watch 
with  a  jealous  eye  some  anointed  younger  brothers  who  they  fear  will  
be a threat to their authority – and they seek to suppress them in every 
way  possible.  The  tragedy  in  Christendom  today  is  that  there  are  very  
few  fathers.  All  seek  their  own.  A  truly  godly  man  will  be  delighted  to  
see  young  brothers  maturing  and  having  a  greater  anointing  on  their  
ministry  than  them.  They  will  push  such  young  brothers  forward  and  
withdraw into the background. If you want to be a godly elder be one like 
that – and not like jealous Cain.
The second example Jude quotes is Balaam. His problem was covetous-
ness and the love of money. Balaam preached many good things – even 
about the coming of the Messiah (Number 24:17). But he also ran after 
money – exactly like many preachers today who preach wonderful truths 
and are just as covetous. Such preachers have gone the way of Balaam.
Thirdly, Jude speaks about Korah. His problem was rebellion against 
authority. Korah would have perished as a slave in Egypt. God never saw 
him fit to be the leader of Israel. He used Moses who delivered Korah from 
slavery.  Moses  encouraged  him  and  even  gave  him  a  position  of  some  
leadership. But this went to Korah’s head and he began to defy Moses. 
See how God judged him. The earth opened and swallowed him up. Cain 
was jealous of his younger brother. Korah was jealous of an older spiritual 
leader. You too can become proud and unsubmissive to godly men who 
led you and fed you – because you now think that you also are a spiritual 

God Needs Men                                                                                                                                        973
Jude
leader. But God will vindicate those whom He has really anointed – and 
that day will be a sad day for you, as it was for Korah.
Rebellion  against  authority  is  something  that  is  unfortunately  very  
common  in  Christendom.  We  should  never  rebel  against  spiritual  
authority anywhere. If you are not happy with a church, leave it and go 
somewhere else. But don’t stay there and cause problems for the leader-
ship.  Otherwise  you  will  end  up  like  Korah.  If  you  don’t  agree  with  a  
group,  leave  it  and  go  elsewhere.  Start  another  group  if  you  like,  but  
never  cause  rebellion  anywhere.  These  men  are  hidden  reefs  –  hidden  
rocks under the water’s surface that ships crash on. They fool people into 
thinking that they have spiritual gifts – but they are like clouds that give 
no rain (1:12).
God Needs Men
Then in contrast to all these bad examples from the Old Testament, Jude 
finally gives a good example from the Old Testament, Enoch (1:14). Enoch 
was  the  only  man  in  the  many  generations  between  Adam  and  Noah  
who walked with God. And he walked with God for 300 year and proph-
esied  (1:14). He was the first prophet in the Bible. And what did this 
first prophet in the Bible proclaim? He proclaimed the second coming of 
Christ and judgement against sinners (1:14, 15). He preached against the 
ungodly actions and the ungodly speech of sinful people. He was a man 
who spoke fearlessly against sin. His great grandson Noah followed in his 
footsteps and walked with God and also proclaimed judgement. What did 
Isaiah preach? Judgement. What did Jonah preach? Judgement. What 
did Nahum preach? Judgement. What did Jeremiah preach? Judgement. 
Every  true  prophet  in  the  Bible  proclaimed  that  God  would  judge  His  
people for their sins. Where are the prophets today who preach the same 
message?
India is one of the largest countries in the world, having a population 
of more than one thousand million people, God loves India. Why then 
doesn’t He send many prophets into our land? I feel that the Lord did 
call  many  young  people  in  our  land  to  be  His  prophets.  But  most  of  
them  got  sidetracked  and  fell  by  the  way  side,  running  after  money,  
or marrying the wrong women, or joining some Western organisation 
and thus missing God’s perfect plan for their lives. God may be having 
a  plan  for  some  of  you  who  are  reading  this,  to  be  prophets  in  our  
country. May you be saved then from missing your calling by marrying 
the wrong girl, or by running after money. May the Lord save you from 
sitting at a desk as the Director of some Christian organisation when 
He wants you to be a prophet for Him. Be like Enoch, the one lone man 
who walked with God and spoke fearlessly for God.

974 Through the Bible: Contend Earnestly for the True Faith 
Jude
That  is  what  Jude  is  saying.  Be  like  Enoch.  Contend  for  the  faith.  
Stand  up  like  him  for  the  truth  of  God.  Stand  against  all  the  grum-
blers who find fault, following after their own lusts, and who speak 
arrogantly and speak flattery (1:16). Stand against the preachers who 
flatter people in order to get some benefit for themselves from them. 
Remember the words of our Lord and of His apostles how they warned 
that in the last days there will be many mockers who follow after their 
own ungodly lusts and who cause divisions among God’s people like 
Korah did –  worldly-minded people who do not have the Holy Spirit at 
all, but who yet talk about the gifts of the Spirit (1:17–19).
Jude concludes with a number of wonderful exhortations. “Build your-
self  up  in  the  most  holy  faith,  pray  in  the  Holy  Spirit,  keep  yourself  in  
the love of God” (1:20, 21). To keep oneself in the love of God means a 
number of things.
Rooted and Grounded in the Love of God
First of all, it means to remain assured at all times about God’s perfect 
love for you. When Peter was going to deny the Lord, the Lord said to him, 
“I am not praying that you will not fall, Peter. I am praying that when you 
do fall, that your faith will not fail.” When you hit rock bottom in your 
life, remember one thing, that God still loves you. The prodigal son, in a 
far country having lost everything, remembered one thing: That his father 
still  loved  him.  That  was  what  brought  him  back  home.  And  that  will  
bring you back home too, however far you may have wandered.
Secondly, it means to keep fervent in your love for God at all times. The 
more we see the love of God for us, the more we will love Him in return.
Thirdly, it means to keep loving others as God has loved us. When the 
assurance of God’s love fills your heart, you will find that you love other 
people too. God loved you when you were in the gutter of sin, and you 
begin to love others who are in the gutter of sin too.
When you keep yourself in the love of God, the Lord will “keep you from 
falling”  (1:24). You keep  yourself  in  the  love  of  God  and  Jesus  keeps 
you from falling into sin. In the beginning, like Peter, you may fall a few 
times. But a time will come, as you humble yourself and build yourself 
up in your faith and keep yourself in the love of God and keep praying 
in the Holy Spirit, that you will find that Jesus keeps you from falling 
into sin (1:20–24). Sin will no longer have any mastery over you.
It  is  with  this  attitude  that  we  are  to  engage  in  evangelism  and  to  
help those who are backslidden (1:22, 23). Jude warns us to be careful 

Rooted and Grounded in the Love of God                                                                                           975
Jude
when seeking to pull sinners out of the fire that we ourselves don’t get 
polluted  by  their  sin  (1:23).  Jesus  was  the  Friend  of  sinners,  He  was  
never polluted. We can walk like Him too.
Many believers can keep themselves holy when they are in the midst of 
godly people. But when they go and visit their unconverted relatives even 
for one week, they backslide and get polluted. They start gossiping and 
watching  TV  programs  that  pollute  them.  My  advice  is  this:  When  you  
are with unconverted relatives who are gossiping or watching some dirty 
TV program, just get up quietly and leave the room. Do the same thing 
the next day and the next day. In a few days they will get the message, 
that you don’t like some of their habits. That will be your silent witness 
to  them.  And  you  would  have  kept  your  spiritual  garments  from  being  
polluted (1:23). When walking through muddy water, how careful you are 
to pull up your trousers, so that they don’t get dirty. Be equally careful 
when in the midst of unbelievers.
The Lord is able to keep us from stumbling and to make us stand in 
His presence, blameless and with great joy. That is the hope we have. 
So may we give all glory, majesty, dominion and authority to God our 
Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord (1:25). Amen.



REVELATION
The Final Triumph
T
he  word  revelation  means  “an  unveiling”.  God  pulled  the  curtain  
away and showed John three things.
1. An unveiling of Christ Himself in His glory (Chapter 1);
2. An unveiling of Christ and His church – the inner state of some of the 
churches (Chapters 2 and 3);
3. An  unveiling  of  Christ  and  His  kingdom  –  how  things  will  be  at  the  
close of this age (Chapters 4 to 22).
A Revelation for Bondslaves of God
1:19 also divides the book of Revelation into three parts: The things which 
you  have  seen  (Chapter  1),  the  things  which  are  at  present  (Chapters 
2  and  3),  and  the  things  which  will  take  place  in  the  future  (Chapters 
4 to 22).
This  revelation  was  given  not  only  for  John,  but  for  all  Christ’s  
bond-servants (1:1). Bond-servants is another word for “slaves”. God has 
His slaves and His servants. What is the difference between a servant and 
a slave? We don’t have slaves today and so we don’t know much about 
that. But in the first century, everyone understood clearly the difference 
between a servant and a slave. A servant gets a salary – and he can claim 
that  every  month.  He  will  stop  working  if  he  doesn’t  get  his  monthly  
salary. A slave however never gets a salary. He has no rights whatsoever. 
All his life he has to just serve and expect nothing in return for his work. 
A servant could appeal to the Roman government if someone ill-treated 
him.  A  slave  however  could  not  appeal  to  anyone  if  he  was  ill-treated.  
God has servants who will serve Him as long as He cares for them and 
provides food, clothing, shelter and money for them. If one day they don’t 
get something they ask for in prayer, they will complain and murmur and 

978 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
stop serving Him. They claim certain rights. They say, “Lord, I did this for 
You. So You have to do this for me.” A slave of God however has given up 
all his rights. If God gives him food and shelter and money he is happy. 
If God gives him nothing, he is still happy. He will joyfully continue to be 
a slave. The one difference is that slaves in those days worked for their 
masters out of compulsion and fear. We however choose to work for God 
out of love, as the slave in Exodus 21:5 said, “I love my master. I will not 
go out free.”
The  book  of  Revelation  can  be  understood  properly  only  if  you  are  a  
bondslave  of  God  –  if  you  have  given  yourself  so  completely  to  God  
that  you  don’t  demand  anything  from  Him;  if  you  belong  to  Him  so  
completely  that  you  have  no  complaints  about  anything  He  does  to  
you, or that he does not do for you, or that you think He should do for 
you; if your attitude is: “Lord, I love You. I am Your slave. I don’t want 
to live for anything other than You. I don’t serve You for money or any 
reward I am going to get – either on earth or in heaven”. 
If  that  is  your  attitude  towards  God,  then  you  will  understand  this  
book. Otherwise you may use your clever brain and study this book all 
your  life  and  get  many  fanciful  interpretations  of  the  symbols  in  this  
book – but you will be totally wrong. You can read all the books in the 
world on Revelation and get many clever ideas. But it won’t be the truth, 
and it won’t change your life. You will live in a world of delusion. So don’t 
ignore the very first verse of this book. Remember always that this reve-
lation of Jesus Christ is something that God reveals only to His slaves. 
John was one of those slaves, and so he understood it. Today also there 
are slaves who understand.
1:1 also says, “He signified it” (KJV). The word ‘signified’ means “showed 
by signs.” That informs us that the whole book will be full of signs. We 
may not be able to understand some of those signs accurately. But the 
more of a slave of God you are, the more accurately you will understand 
them.  The  less  of  a  slave  of  God  you  are,  the  less  you  will  understand  
them.  Today  there  are  many  interpretations  of  Revelation,  because  the  
ones interpreting are not slaves. Maybe they are servants. Servants can 
give their opinions. But such opinions are fit only for the trash-can.
In 1:3, we read, “Blessed is the man who reads this book and obeys the 
things  written  in  it.” There  is  a  special  blessing  promised  here  for  those  
who hear and obey the things written in this book. Now you can see why 
the devil doesn’t allow most Christians to read this book. It doesn’t say, 
“Blessed are those who understand this book.” No. The blessing is for those 
who obey. It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand all the prophecies in 
this book, provided you obey the commands of the Lord in this book.
The book of Revelation has not been given to us to make charts about 
the future. I have heard so many theories spun by Bible-teachers with 

A Brother and a Fellow Partner                                                                                                              979
Revelation
their charts that teach when the rapture of the church will take place and 
how the seven churches are pictures of different periods in the church 
age from the 1
st
 to the 21
st
 century. I have also seen people who study 
these charts, fight and quarrel with each other and live a defeated life, 
having no victory over sin. Such charts are fit for the trash-can. What 
you  need  to  know  is  not  the  explanation  of  all  the  prophecies  in  this  
book, but how to obey all that the Lord has commanded here. When you 
find verses in here that you don’t understand, just leave them aside, and 
obey what you can understand.
John  writes  to  the  seven  churches  from  “Jesus  Christ  the  ruler  of  all  
the kings of earth” (1:5). And immediately he talks about Christ’s return, 
“He is coming in the clouds” (1:7). When Christ returns, He will not come 
secretly. He will come as He Himself said, like the lightning shining from 
one end of the sky to another – that everyone will see (Matthew 24:27). 
There  will  be  no  secret  rapture  of  the  church  before  the  tribulation  
as  many  falsely  believe.  There  is  only  one  coming  of  Christ  –  after  the  
 tribulation – and that is when the church will be raptured to meet Him in 
the sky. Every eye will see us being taken up to heaven.
A Brother and a Fellow Partner
In 1:9,  we  see  John  referring  to  himself  as  “your  brother.”  He  was  not  
Pope  John  or  Bishop  John  or  Reverend  John  or  even  Pastor  John.  At  
the age of 95, he was still just Brother John – an ordinary brother, just 
like  all  other  brothers  in  Christ.  There  we  have  a  good  example  for  all  
Christian leaders to follow. But I am certain that 98% of church-leaders 
will not follow John’s example – because their sense of superiority and 
their desire to exalt themselves over other believers will make them want 
to retain their titles. They love their titles! Jesus told His disciples that 
they were all brothers and servants and commanded them never to take 
any other titles (Matthew 23:8–11). But that is just another command of 
our Lord’s, that most Christians disobey.
John  was  also  “a  fellow  partner  in  the  tribulation”  (1:9).  The  book  of  
Revelation has a lot to say about tribulation. But if one is to preach about 
tribulation, he needs to have gone through tribulation himself first. So 
John had to go through tribulation. He was exiled on the island of Patmos, 
and while suffering tribulation there, he got a vision of how the church 
would  go  through  tribulation.  If  you  had  gone  to  John  on  Patmos  and  
told him, “Brother, the church will not go through tribulation,” he would 
have said, “Brother, I am going through tribulation right now.” Do you 
think that any suffering that Christians will face in the final great tribu-
lation  will  be  worse  than  what  many  Christians  have  suffered  in  these  
2000 years of church history – and especially in many communist coun-
tries in the last 100 years? Is it because God did not love the Christians 
in the first three centuries of Christian history, that He allowed them to 

980 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
face such terrible tribulations at the hands of non-Christians and to be 
tortured and killed in painful ways? God allows His greatest saints to go 
through tribulation from man, in order to manifest their faith and thus 
to glorify His Name before demons and men.
John continues: “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day” (1:10). It’s only 
when  we  are  “in  the  Spirit”  that  we  can  understand  what  God  reveals.  
“And  I  heard  a  loud  voice  like  the  sound  of  a  trumpet”  (1:10).  When  we  
are in the Spirit, God’s voice will sound loud and clear as a trumpet. If 
you  are  not  in  the  Spirit,  you  will  not  hear  anything.  There  are  many  
voices  in  the  air  nowadays  –  rock  music,  false  teachings,  preachers  of  
false religions, etc. To hear any of them, all you need is a radio tuned to 
that frequency. In the same way, when we are tuned to the Holy Spirit’s 
frequency  in  our  hearts  (which  means  having  a  clear  conscience  with  
God and men), we will hear God’s voice, loud as a trumpet. That is how 
John heard it.
The Lord told John to write down what he saw and to send it to seven 
churches. John was on Patmos – a rocky island in the Aegean Sea, about 
100 kilometres south-west of Ephesus on the mainland. John was asked 
to send a message to the church at Ephesus. About 100 kilometres north 
of  Ephesus  was  Smyrna.  About  40  kilometres  north-west  of  that  was  
Pergamum. About 100 kilometres south-east of that was Thyatira. About 
40 kilometres south of that was Sardis. About 40 kilometres south-east 
of that was Philadelphia. And south-east of that was Laodicea, which was 
about 100 kilometres from Ephesus. So all these churches were within 
a  circle  of  about  100  kilometres  radius.  Yet  they  did  not  belong  to  one  
denomination. They were all independent churches. They did not have a 
bishop ruling over all of them. Each church had its own elders. That’s how 
all churches were in the first century, when the apostles planted them.
Because  they  were  all  independent  churches,  corruption  from  one  
church could not spread to the other churches. If however they had all 
been  in  one  denomination,  then  if  one  church  became  corrupt,  all  the  
other  churches  in  that  denomination  would  have  become  corrupt  too.  
If  one  bishop  went  astray,  he  would  lead  the  whole  denomination  of  
churches astray. So in God’s wisdom, the New Testament pattern is that 
each church should be independent, and not part of a denomination. So 
John was asked to send the letters not to “the church in Asia Minor”, but 
to “to the churches”. Do you see the difference? In God’s eyes there is no 
such thing as “the church in India”. There are churches in India. But man 
has used his wisdom and combined many churches into one denomina-
tion – and thus corruption has spread to all the churches.
When John turned around, he did not see one lampstand with seven 
branches,  as  in  the  Old  Testament  tabernacle.  He  saw  seven  separate 
lamp  stands.  That  symbolised  seven  independent  churches  –  and  not  
one denomination with seven branches. In the middle of the seven lamp-
stands stood Jesus, the Head of each church.

Seven Churches                                                                                                                                         981
Revelation
Then  John  describes  Jesus  in  symbolic  language  –  symbols  of  His  
purity and power. The word of God is seen as going out of His mouth as 
a sharp sword (1:16). John, who once leaned on Jesus’ breast at the last 
supper, now falls on his face as a dead man before the Lord. John was 
at  that  time  perhaps  the  holiest  man  on  earth.  And  he  fell  on  his  face  
with his mouth in the dust. Whenever you see the glory of the Lord, that 
is what will happen to you too. You will humble yourself. It is when you 
don’t see the glory of the Lord that you get puffed up. 
Jesus spoke to John (who had suffered persecution for so many years) 
the same word that He had always spoken to His apostles when He was 
on earth, “Don’t be afraid” (1:17). That is the one word that rings through-
out the book of Revelation. That is the word that comes to us also as we 
face the prospect of persecution and tribulation in the future. “Don’t be 
afraid. See My glory. Forget about your persecutors. I am the First and I 
am the Last. Don’t be afraid of the people who seek to persecute you. I am 
the Living One. I was dead and now I am alive. I have the keys of death. 
You cannot go through the door of death, until I open it. So don’t be afraid.” 
Tradition tells us that John was not killed. He died a natural death at a 
ripe old age, because Jesus decided how and when to open death’s door 
for him.
Jesus  is  the  One  Who  decides  for  you  and  me  whether  we  will  be  
martyred  in  India  for  the  cause  of  the  gospel  or  whether  we  will  die  a  
natural  death.  No  anti-Christian  persecutor  is  going  to  determine  that  
for us. Our Lord has already determined how He will call us to Himself. 
That has already been written in His book. He has the keys of death. I am 
not afraid – and you don’t have to be afraid either. It will be impossible to 
serve God faithfully in the days of tribulation if we don’t see this vision 
of our risen Lord first. We must see Jesus in all His glory first, before 
we look at anything around us. John had to see the glory of Jesus first 
before  he  saw  the  backslidden  condition  of  the  churches  around  him.  
Otherwise he would have been discouraged. When I see the backslidden 
state of some church, I say, “Lord, let me see Your glory first. Then I won’t 
be discouraged.”
Seven Churches
The  Lord  then  told  John  that  the  seven  stars  in  His  hand  were  the  
messengers of the churches (1:20). The word for “angel” and “messenger” 
are the same in the Greek language (“aggelos”). Among the two or three 
elders in each church, the one who had the gift of preaching the Word 
was called “the messenger”. John was asked to write to the messenger of 
each church, giving him a message both for him and for his church.
The seven lampstands represented the seven churches, each of which 
was directly  under  the  Lord  Himself.  There  was  no  bishop  in  charge  of  
the seven churches. If there had been a bishop, Jesus would have asked 

982 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
John to send the letter to the bishop to circulate it to the seven churches. 
But John had to send separate letters to each messenger of each church. 
This is the new-covenant pattern – each church independent under its 
own  leadership.  If  you  are  an  apostle,  you  can  be  a  spiritual  father  to  
the churches you planted (as Paul was) to guide and correct them when 
needed. But each church must be under the headship of the Lord alone.
In Chapters 2 and 3, we read about the seven churches. Two of them 
were in very good shape, but five of them were terribly backslidden.
A Loveless Church
The church in Ephesus was a loveless church. The elder and the church 
had many good qualities (2:2). They had many good deeds and hard work 
and perseverance to their credit. They would not tolerate evil men, which 
means they judged sin in their midst. They would not endure false proph-
ets either, which means that they exposed false doctrine. In addition they 
had  suffered  for  Jesus’  Name,  without  getting  weary  (2:3).  One  would  
think this was a wonderful church, with purity in life, purity in doctrine, 
enduring in suffering, laboring and holding up the name of Jesus. But 
the Lord told them that all this was worthless because they didn’t love 
Him like they loved Him at first (2:4).
Do you see there how important it is to love the Lord wholeheartedly? 
All your work for the Lord is worth zero without a passionate love for the 
Lord Himself. The Lord told them that they had fallen. Can you imagine 
that an elder who fights for purity of life and doctrine, and who works 
hard for the Lord could be a backslider? He was a backslider because he 
had lost his love for the Lord. He had fallen. Once, all that he did had 
come out of a fervent love for the Lord. But not now. It had now become 
a routine. He had fallen – and he had to repent.
The relationship Jesus wants to have with us is like a marriage relation-
ship between husband and wife. A newly married wife loves her husband 
and is happy to serve him out of love. In the first year of marriage, she 
works hard at home, cooking the food, washing the clothes and keeping 
the house tidy, and waits for her husband to come back from work. As 
soon as the doorbell rings, she rushes to the door to greet her husband. 
They enjoy their time together over dinner and thereafter. But if you visit 
that house twenty years later, things have changed. The wife still cooks 
the meals, washes the clothes and keeps the house tidy. But when the 
husband comes and rings the bell she doesn’t go to the door. He has a key 
and he can open the door himself. She has finished her dinner earlier. 
Her husband can go and eat his dinner by himself. She still serves him – 
but her love for him has gone.
That was what happened to the elder and to his church in Ephesus. 
And that is what can happen to you and me, if we don’t preserve our love 
for our Lord. We must always be able to say, “Lord, I love You first and 

Seven Churches                                                                                                                                         983
Revelation
foremost – and not my ministry. I want to love You today more than I ever 
loved You.”
What does a good husband want from his wife? He doesn’t care how 
well she cooks the food or washes the clothes. He wants her first of all, 
to love him fervently – more every year than the previous year. That is 
a good marriage. And that is how it must be between us and our Lord. 
Many a time, I have laid down on my bed and said, “Lord, if I am para-
lysed one day and I can’t preach any more and have to lie down in my 
bed the whole day, I will not be discouraged. I will still love You with all 
my heart. That is all that I live for. My ministry is not my god. I may never 
write another book and never preach another sermon. But my love for 
You, my Lord will increase more and more, every day.” If it is like that 
with you, then your service for the Lord will be full of joy and victory.
To each of these churches the Lord concludes with a message to those 
who  overcome.  Here  He  tells  the  overcomers,  that  He  will  grant  them  
“to eat from the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God” (2:7). The over-
comers will get what Adam missed. That promise is not for everyone. It is 
only for those who overcome.
A Suffering Church
The church in Smyrna was a suffering church. It was facing a lot of tribu-
lation  (2:9).  This  church  would  never  have  believed  the  false  teaching  
going around today that the church would escape the great tribulation! 
The Lord was very happy with this church for it was faithful to Him in 
the midst of tribulation. God loves His people and permits them to face 
tribulation – to purify them. Tribulation had made this church spiritually 
rich (2:9). They were being persecuted by people who called themselves 
Jews (the people of God) but were actually the synagogue of Satan. Today 
also there are people who call themselves Christians but who persecute 
the godly. They are actually the “church of Satan”.
The Lord’s word to this church was what He told John “Don’t be afraid 
of what you are going to suffer” (2:10). This could be a word for some of us 
today. “The devil will put some of you into prison. But don’t be afraid.” Can 
the devil put God’s servants in prison? He certainly can. All the apostles 
experienced  that.  We  may  experience  that  too.  Satan  can  drag  you  to  
court through other “Christians” who hate you. Jesus Himself was taken 
to court by religious people – and even killed. If you follow the Lord and 
follow in His footsteps, you will go wherever He went. If you are put into 
prison,  you  can  be  sure  that  that  will  happen  only  with  God’s  express  
permission. The first book written in the Bible (the book of Job) teaches 
us that God has to give Satan permission before he can do anything to 
God’s  servants.  And  if  God  allows  you  to  be  put  into  prison,  it  will  be  
“so you will be tested” (2:10). A test is an examination. If you pass the 
examination, you will be promoted. So don’t despise God’s tests. And if 

984 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
God decides to conduct your test in a prison, then be ready to answer 
His question-paper there! The more tests you pass, the more promotions 
you will get. Then you won’t be sitting in the same class forever, as many 
believers are.
We  notice  another  fact  here.  God  determines  the  exact  period  of  our  
trials. Here the Lord told them that their trial would be “only for ten days” 
(2:10). On the eleventh day they would be free. God determined how long 
Job  should  suffer,  how  long  Peter  should  be  in  prison,  and  how  long  
these people in the church should suffer. God determines how long you 
should suffer something that you have to go through. You may be in the 
middle of a trial right now. But remember that God has already deter-
mined the date on which your trial will be over. Isn’t that good for us to 
know? “Be faithful till the end,” the Lord tells them and then He promises 
them “the crown of life.”
Here the Lord promises the overcomers that they will not be hurt by 
the second death (2:11).
A Worldly Church
The church in Pergamum was a worldly church. The Lord said to them, 
“I know you are living where Satan’s throne is” (2:13). That indicates that 
Satan had a special interest in that city. Satan doesn’t keep his throne 
everywhere. He has his throne in one place and sends his demons every-
where.  Satan  had  his  throne  in  those  days  in  Pergamum.  Part  of  the  
reason for that may have been that in that city there was a very faithful 
servant  of  God  named  Antipas  (2:13).  When  Satan  saw  how  whole-
hearted  Antipas  was,  he  determined  to  make  his  headquarters  in  that  
city  to  harass  him.  Antipas  must  have  been  the  elder  in  that  church,  
who  through  his  faithful  life  and  preaching  had  kept  the  church  pure.  
The Lord called him, “My witness, My faithful one.” Satan finally got him 
killed. But he died only when Jesus opened the door of death for him – for 
our Lord has the keys of death (1:18). It was Jesus Who opened the door 
of death for Stephen and for all the apostles who died before John. When 
Antipas  died,  the  usual  thing  happened  in  Pergamum  that  happens  in  
many churches when a godly leader dies. It began to decline spiritually. 
The  church  of  God  depends  at  times  on  one  godly  man.  Once  Antipas  
was gone, all the other elders were compromisers, just as it happened in 
Ephesus after Paul left (Acts 20:29, 30).
Now the church in Pergamum started following the teaching of Balaam. 
That means they ran after money and allowed immorality in their midst, 
as Balaam did. Some in the church held the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 
We don’t know what exactly the teaching of the Nicolaitans was, but it 
was something that God hated. The Lord called them to repent, as other-
wise  He  would  judge  them  (2:16).  The  Lord  promised  the  overcomers  
there that He would give them some secret revelations (“hidden manna”) 

Seven Churches                                                                                                                                         985
Revelation
that would not be given to others. He would also give them a stone (like 
a  wedding  ring  with  a  diamond)  with  a  new  name  written  on  it  (2:17). 
In other words, the Lord would treat the overcomers there like a loving 
husband treats his beloved wife.
An Adulterous Church
The church in Thyatira was an adulterous church. They had many works, 
and love, faith, service and perseverance. But along with all of that, there 
was  also  spiritual  adultery  in  their  midst.  There  was  a  woman  there,  
whom the Lord refers to as Jezebel. She was probably the elder’s wife, 
since the word ‘woman’ here can also be translated as ‘wife.’ The elder 
here was being controlled by his wife. Perhaps, after he had taken deci-
sions in an elders’ meeting, when he came home, his wife would tell him 
things to change his mind. So he would arrange another elders’ meeting 
and change the decisions as his wife suggested! Such things are happen-
ing in many churches even today. There are Jezebels who control elders 
of churches.
Queen Jezebel in Israel controlled her husband Ahab. He was a weak 
man who was easily manipulated by his wife. Many church-elders are like 
that, without a spiritual backbone. Their wives control them. There were 
7000  people  in  Israel  in  Jezebel’s  time,  who  had  not  worshipped  idols.  
But  Jezebel  was  not  afraid  of  any  of  them.  She  was  afraid  of  only  one  
man – Elijah. What a powerful woman she was! There are some powerful 
women like that in churches today – and there is a need for some Elijahs 
to put them in their proper place. If as an elder, you are not strong like 
Elijah to put such strong women in their proper place, your church will 
end up as another adulterous church like the one in Thyatira.
This woman brought all types of worldliness into that church. And the 
Lord  warned  saying  that  He  would  severely  punish  all  who  listened  to  
her teachings, which He calls “the deep truths of Satan” (2:22–24). The 
overcomers are promised spiritual authority (just as God gave Elijah) and 
they will rule the nations with a rod of iron one day (2:26, 27).
A Hypocritical Church
The church in Sardis was a hypocritical church. It had a name that it was 
alive, but it was spiritually dead. The elder had made a name for himself 
through his preaching. His doctrines were all evangelical. But he didn’t 
have a life to back up his preaching. He was a compromiser. He lived on 
his  name  and  his  reputation.  But  the  Lord  noticed  that  in  his  church  
there  were  a  few  brothers  (probably  young  brothers)  who  were  zealous  
and  pure,  who  had  not  corrupted  their  garments,  and  who  were  more  
spiritual than their elder (3:4). The overcomers were promised that they 
would be clothed in white garments (3:5). Those who do not overcome are 

986 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
warned here that their names would be “erased from the book of life” (3:5). 
Many verses like this prove that the “once saved, always saved” doctrine 
is a false teaching invented by Satan. Yet many Christians believe and 
preach that, totally ignoring verses such as this.
A Faithful Church
The church in Philadelphia was the faithful church. The elder was faithful, 
and so the church was faithful. The Lord told them, “I have put before 
you  an  open  door  which  nobody  can  shut”  (3:8).  When  the  Lord  opens  
a door for us nobody can shut it. He says, “I have the keys. I open and 
no man can shut” (3:7). We don’t have to go banging away at any door. 
Our Lord opens the right ones for us, without our even touching them. 
They  are  like  the  automatic  doors  that  we  have  seen  in  some  airports  
that open as soon as you come near them. Are you looking for a door of 
ministry for yourself? Are you trying to open such a door for yourself or 
looking to some influential man to open that door for you? Are you covet-
ing the ministry that someone else has? That is evil. Be faithful to God 
in the little things and He will open the right doors of ministry for you at 
the right time. Then you won’t waste your time or your life, going through 
many wrong doors. Trust in God and let Him alone open the doors for 
you – and He will lead you step by step to the places that He has planned 
for you.
I remember once when I was travelling to a certain country the Lord 
said to me, “You are not to write to anyone you know in that country that 
you are going there. Just go.” I went there and had no ministry anywhere 
– and I came back. The Lord tested me to see if I would obey Him. The 
next  time  I  went  to  that  country,  the  Lord  opened  so  many  doors  to  
people I did not even know. Those were the places that the Lord wanted 
me to go to. I saw then that God in His sovereignty opens the right doors. 
If I had tried to open doors by myself earlier, to create some ministry for 
myself,  I  would  have  missed  the  will  of  God  completely.  So  don’t  ever  
push yourself forward anywhere. Wait on God and let Him open the right 
doors for you. Like the ones in Philadelphia, you may have just a little 
strength. But if you keep God’s Word and do not deny His Name, the Lord 
will make even your enemies recognise that He has loved you (3:8, 9).
Then the Lord told this church, “I am coming quickly. Hold fast what 
you have so that nobody takes your crown” (3:11). When the Lord gives 
us a ministry, we must be faithful in fulfilling it. Otherwise He will give 
that  ministry  to  someone  else  and  then  that  person  will  get  the  crown  
that was meant for you! He will get his crown and yours as well. So be 
faithful. The Lord will make those who overcome “pillars in His church” 
(3:12). Pillars are what hold up a building. When Samson pushed down 
two pillars, the whole building collapsed. Sometimes there are only two 
elders who hold up a whole church. When they die, the church dies as 

Seven Churches                                                                                                                                         987
Revelation
well. God wants many pillars in His churches. You can be a pillar, if you 
seek to overcome sin in your private life and in your thoughts.
A Proud Church
The  church  in  Laodicea  was  a  proud  church.  Here  was  an  elder  and  a  
church that were totally content with themselves, even though they were 
thoroughly dead spiritually. They had not become cold (that is, thoroughly 
worldly), but they were not on fire for God either. They were half-hearted 
and lukewarm, which means they had a casual attitude to sin. The Lord 
spits such elders and churches out of His mouth (3:15, 16). An elder is 
to be God’s mouth and spokesman to the church. But God was rejecting 
this man. He had been God’s mouthpiece once, speaking the prophetic 
word to the church. But he had taken it easy and backslidden and now 
lost the anointing and the fire of the Holy Spirit. God was now rejecting 
him, not because of any wrong doctrine, but only because he was not on 
fire for God. We must live totally for the Lord or for the world. We cannot 
be half here and half there.
Who are the ones who bring the greatest disgrace to the Name of Jesus 
Christ in India? Not the non-Christians, for they do not take the name 
of  Christ,  but  Christians  who  are  half-hearted  –  those  who  claim  to  be  
believers but who love money and sinful pleasures and live for the world. 
We must either be on fire for Christ living totally for the glory of God, 
or  be  thoroughly  worldly.  Those  are  the  only  two  options.  There  is  no  
third option. The church in Laodicea did not believe that the Lord would 
prefer  for  them  to  be  totally  cold  and  worldly  rather  than  be  lukewarm. 
Most  Christians  do  not  believe  that  today  either.  When  Christ  returns  
and you stand before Him, you will discover that every lukewarm person 
is  going  to  be  rejected  by  the  Lord.  Every  lukewarm  Christian  will  be  
spat out of the mouth of Jesus, even if he is an elder of a church. If you 
don’t believe that, then you must be honest and scratch out this verse 
(Revelation  3:16)  from  your  Bible.  I  believe  it,  I  preach  it  and  I  judge  
myself in the light of it always.
This last church was so bad that the Lord had absolutely nothing good 
to say about it. He was outside its door and knocking to get entry (3:20). 
Most  Christians  quote  that  verse  to  unbelievers.  But  it  was  actually  
spoken by the Lord to the elder of a church. Things were so bad in that 
elder’s life that Christ Himself was outside his life trying to get in. And 
Christ was outside his church as well. They were singing songs of praise 
and preaching God’s Word inside that church. But the Lord was waiting 
outside its door! This is the condition of many churches and elders today 
as well.
If  the  Bridegroom  is  outside  the  door  of  a  church,  where  should  His  
bride  be?  The  bride  will  be  outside  the  door  with  Him.  I  don’t  want  to  
sit  inside  any  church  when  my  Bridegroom  is  outside  its  door.  If  they  

988 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
have rejected Him, they will reject me too, if I am a faithful bride of His. 
The sad thing today is that there are churches that have rejected Christ 
and His word, but there are believers sitting inside those churches. That 
proves that they are not a part of the Bride of Christ. If they were, they 
would be outside the door with their Lord. Such words are strong words. 
But they are the words of the Lord in the last book of the Bible.
The  overcomer  is  promised  a  place  on  Jesus’  throne  even  as  Jesus  
also overcame and sits with His Father on His throne (3:21). This verse 
teaches us clearly that Jesus also overcame in the days of His flesh. He 
Himself said that He had “overcome the world” (John 16:33). He had to 
fight a battle against temptation and thus overcame. There is no over-
coming  without  a  battle.  Jesus  faced  battles  in  His  earthly  life  and  He  
consistently  overcame  in  every  battle.  Therefore  He  was  exalted  to  sit  
with  His  Father  on  His  throne  (3:21). Now He encourages us to fight 
our battles and to overcome, and promises us a place with Him on His 
throne. We are to walk the same road that He walked. In the messages 
to all the seven churches, the Lord specifically speaks to the overcomers 
in each church.
What is the last message of the Lord to His church? Jesus started out 
preaching  repentance  to  unbelievers,  saying,  “Repent,  for  the  kingdom  
of  heaven  is  at  hand”  (Matthew  4:17). His final message to the  church 
in Revelation  2  and  3  is  also  the  same:  “Repent.  Elders  of  churches,  
repent.” The twofold message in the book of Revelation is, “Repent” and 
“Overcome.” If you have been gripped by these two messages, then you 
have  understood  the  main  truths  in  the  book  of  Revelation.  You  don’t  
have  to  understand  the  charts  about  the  future  that  many  preachers  
show  along  with  their  messages  on  Revelation.  You  just  have  to  be  an  
overcomer. Many who study those charts are not overcomers. The impor-
tant thing is to obey God’s Word – not just understand it. Be like the few 
in Sardis who kept their garments pure.
Come Up Here
In 4:1, the Lord tells John, “Come up here and I will show you what will 
take place in the future.” From here onwards, the Lord shows John some 
of the things that will happen in the future – towards the end of this age, 
just before the Lord returns to earth. That is a beautiful word “Come up 
here.” If we are to be strong enough to face the persecution that will come 
upon Christians in the future, then we must listen to this word of Jesus, 
“Come  up  here  where  I  am  and  look  at  everything  from  My  heavenly  
viewpoint.” Then we won’t be afraid. If however, we look at things from an 
earthly viewpoint, then we can be gripped with fear.
In Chapter 4, we see the first of seven glimpses of heaven found in the 
book of Revelation. In Revelation, we read of seven spirits, seven trum-
pets, seven seals, seven bowls, and we also see seven glimpses of heaven. 

The Lion is a Lamb                                                                                                                                    989
Revelation
In  every  glimpse  that  we  see  of  heaven  here,  we  find  everyone  prais-
ing and worshipping the Lord there. That is what heaven is like. If you 
want to get ready for heaven, you have to start praising and worshipping 
God now – for that is the spirit of heaven. The Lord God Almighty is on 
His throne. The elders are falling down, casting their crowns before God 
and worshipping Him (4:10). No-one is boasting about the crowns they 
won. They are casting them down before the Lord saying, “You alone are 
worthy,  O  Lord.”  When  godly  men  receive  rewards  from  God  for  their  
faithful service on earth, each one of them will say, “Lord, this crown will 
not be on my head – for it is rightfully Yours. You are the One Who gave 
me grace to live and to serve You. I am just one among millions of Your 
servants. Lord, You alone are worthy.” That is the attitude of every truly 
godly man even here on earth.
The Lion is a Lamb
In Chapter 5, John sees a scroll. He hears a voice saying, “Who can open 
this book and break the seals?” This is referring to our redemption. There 
is a beautiful picture of this in the Old Testament law that stated that if a 
man became so poor that he sold himself as a slave, his brother (or close 
relative)  could  pay  the  redemption  money  and  redeem  him  (Leviticus 
25:47, 48). In the book of Ruth, we see the rich Boaz marrying his rela-
tive’s widow, Ruth, and redeeming her and her land as well (Ruth 4:1–10). 
Boaz there is a picture of Christ and Ruth is a picture of the church – the 
despised  Gentile  whom  Boaz  redeemed  and  married.  According  to  the  
Law, only a brother or close relative could do this redemption. So Jesus 
came in the flesh and become our Brother so that He could redeem us.
In 5:5, we see one of the elders telling John, “Don’t weep. The Lion of 
Judah has overcome.” John turned to see the Lion, but what he saw was 
a Lamb (5:6). The Lion is a Lamb. A truly godly man is both a lion and 
a lamb. A preacher must be a lion against Satan in the pulpit and as a 
lamb among the people.
Jesus took the book. You see there the result of the prayers of many of 
the saints for hundreds and hundreds of years (5:8). All over the world 
for many centuries, Christians have been praying, “Our Father who art in 
Heaven. Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come.” Now finally it is time 
for the kingdom to come. No prayer is wasted – not the prayers offered 
1900 years ago nor the prayers offered now. Not a single prayer prayed 
by  a  sincere  believer  is  ever  wasted.  It  all  goes  up  like  incense  before  
God and finally the answer comes. They then sing a new song, “Thou 
art worthy.” “New” means “ever fresh”. In heaven, they are never tired of 
singing that Jesus’ blood has purchased them. I hope you are never tired 
of singing that. One of the prayers I have prayed is, “Lord, don’t let the 
death of Jesus on Calvary ever become a stale truth for me.” I want it to 
be always fresh, whenever I sing of Calvary’s cross and the amazing love 

990 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
of Jesus that saved a wretched sinner like me. Each time I sing it, I want 
to sing it as though I am hearing this truth for the very first time. Then I 
will be in tune with heaven’s singing. The Holy Spirit can keep this fresh 
for us always. Then we see millions of angels and all creation joining in 
the worship and praise of God (5:11–13).
Seals Being Opened
In Chapter 6, we see a number of seals being opened – and various events 
taking place, similar to what Jesus said would happen in the last days (in 
Matthew 24 and Luke 21:25, 26). 
When the first seal is broken, a man comes forth on a white horse 
and a crown is given to him (6:2). This cannot symbolise Christ, because 
Christ comes with many crowns of His own, whereas this man is given a 
crown. This is the Antichrist, pretending to be the Christ, by coming on 
a white horse.
When the second seal is broken, we see a red horse – a picture of war 
(6:4). Peace will be taken from the earth in the last days. 
When  the  third  seal  is  broken,  we  see  a  black  horse  with  a  pair  of  
scales  in  his  hand  saying,  “This  is  the  price  of  wheat,  this  is  the  price  
of  barley.  The  oil  and  wine  we  will  not  touch”  (6:5,  6).  This  is  a  picture  
of famine. The interesting thing we see here is that during the famine, 
the wheat and barley (necessities) will be expensive. But the price of the 
luxurious  items  (oil  and  wine)  will  not  be  affected.  That  means  that  in  
the time of famine, the rich will not suffer but the poor will. We see that 
happening around us today. The rich are getting richer everywhere and 
the poor are getting poorer.
When the fourth seal is broken, we see an ashen horse, symbolising 
death, coming forth, killing multitudes of people (6:8).
When  the  fifth  seal  is  broken,  John  sees  the  souls  of  the  martyrs 
–  those  godly  people  who  were  persecuted  and  killed  from  the  time  
of  Abel  onwards.  Abel’s  blood  cried  out  for  vengeance  (Genesis  4:10). 
And  throughout  the  Old  Testament,  the  blood  of  many  prophets  that  
was shed, also cried out for vengeance. When John wrote this book (in 
95 A.D.), not many Christians had become martyrs as yet. But many Old 
Testament  saints  had  been  martyred.  Those  Old  Testament  saints  are  
crying out, “Lord, how long are You going to wait before You avenge our 
blood?” (6:10). They were told to wait a little longer, because a few more 
martyrs had to shed their blood. We see now that they have had to wait 
for more than 2000 years. A certain number of martyrs have to be killed 
(6:11).  Just  like  a  certain  number  of  people  have  to  be  saved  (whose  
names are in the Book of Life), before Christ returns, there is a second 
list – of Christian martyrs who have to be killed. It will be a great honour 
if our names are in that second list. When the last martyr in that list is 
killed, Jesus will return.

Seals Being Opened                                                                                                                                  991
Revelation
When  Jesus  broke  the  sixth  seal  there  was  a  great  earthquake,  the  
sun became black, the moon became like blood, the stars of the sky fell, 
the sky was split, the mountains and the islands were removed, and the 
kings of the earth began to hide in the caves (6:12–16). The strong people 
on earth suddenly became fearful and weak – because the time had come 
for God to judge.
In those six seals, we see a glimpse of the end of the ages in a nutshell. 
The book of Revelation is not written in sequence. Here we are given a 
bird’s eye-view of the end-time events, and thereafter, we are given the 
smaller details. Later in the book, we are again given a bird’s eye-view of 
future events and again the small details.
Chapter 7 refers to the time when the tribulation is about to begin – and 
is divided into two parts. The first part refers to Israel (7:1–8). A remnant 
from  Israel,  who  do  not  know  Jesus  as  their  Saviour,  but  who  are  
God-fearing, is represented here by 144,000 from different tribes. This is 
only a symbolic number (We must remember the word ‘signified’ that we 
saw in Chapter 1). This signifies a small group of people from Israel.
In 1948, Israel came back to the land that God had promised to their 
forefather  Abraham.  Jesus  spoke  of  the  fig  tree  (a  symbol  of  Israel) 
putting  forth  leaves.  There  will  be  no  fruit  there  but  only  leaves.  That  
began in 1948 and moved one step further in 1967, when Jerusalem was 
retaken by Israel. These are all in fulfilment of prophecies that Jesus 
made more than 1900 years ago. He said that Jerusalem would be ruled 
by  the  Gentiles  until  the  times  of  the  Gentiles  were  over  (Luke  21:24). 
When Jesus was in Jerusalem, the Romans ruled that city. From then 
on, until 1967, Jerusalem was always ruled by some foreign power (as 
Jesus had predicted). In the time of the tribulation, there will be a group 
of God-fearing Israelites who will be sealed by God.
Then in 7:9–17, we see another group – a great multitude from every 
tribe, tongue and nation crying out saying, “Our salvation is due to our 
God and the Lamb on the throne,” and falling down and worshipping the 
Lord. They are clothed in white robes – robes that were washed and made 
white in the blood of the Lamb. These are believers. This is a great multi-
tude because it includes all the babies that died in infancy and that were 
aborted before birth, in every tribe and nation on earth. (Babies who die 
go to heaven, by virtue of the blood of Christ).
When it says here that “they came out of the great tribulation” (7:14), 
it means that they were in the tribulation and came out of it. (Just as in 
Chapter 18:4, the Lord invites His people to “come out of Babylon” – which 
means  that  they  were  in  Babylon  and  had  to  come  out  of  it.  Even  so  
here.) The church here (not every individual in the church but those who 
are on earth in the last days) go through the great tribulation and come 
out  of  it.  The  New  Testament  consistently  teaches  this  truth  that  the  
church will go through the great tribulation. There is not a single verse 
anywhere in the New Testament that teaches otherwise.

992 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
Silence in Heaven
In Chapter 8:1, we read that there is silence in heaven for half an hour. 
This is an amazing thing, because all the other pictures of heaven in this 
book are those of loud praise, as loud as thunder and the roar of mighty 
rivers. This half an hour of silence indicates that God is now going to do 
something that He does not like to do – pour out His wrath upon those 
who rebel. He does not like to do it. It is a “strange work” (Isaiah 28:21 - 
KJV) and an “unusual task” (NASB) for Him. In Isaiah 61:2, we read that 
“the  acceptable  period  of  the  Lord”  is  a  whole  year  (365  days)  whereas  
“the period of vengeance” (judgement) is only one day. There we see that 
the  proportion  of  God’s  grace  to  His  vengeance  is  365:1.  Judgement  is  
a  strange  work  that  He  is  reluctant  to  do.  That  is  the  meaning  of  this  
silence in heaven.
Then “the seven angels stood to sound their seven trumpets” (8:2). This 
is the sevenfold last trumpet, after which the dead in Christ will rise and 
we who are alive will be raptured together with them to meet the Lord in 
the air. 1 Corinthians 15:52 also states that the dead will be raised and 
we will be changed at the last trumpet – not before that. The church will 
never face God’s wrath. The great tribulation is a period of the wrath of 
men against the church. But at the end of the great tribulation, as the 
wrath  of  God  is  just  about  to  be  poured  out  on  the  earth,  the  church  
will be taken up to meet our Lord in the air and to welcome Him back to 
the earth.
Then  John  sees  incense  being  added  to  the  prayers  of  the  saints,  
ascending to God (8:4). The incense symbolises the Name of Jesus added 
to  the  prayers  that  make  our  prayers  acceptable  to  God.  Then  many  
natural calamities happen on the earth and in the sky when the trumpets 
sound. When the first trumpet sounds, there is hail and fire. When the 
second one sounds, the mountains are thrown into the sea (8:8). When 
the third one sounds, a great star falls from heaven; and when the fourth 
trumpet sounds a third of the sun, the moon and the stars are smitten. 
When the fifth angel sounds his trumpet, many demons are released 
from the bottomless pit (9:1–11). Most demons are free to travel between 
the second heaven (Satan’s headquarters) and the earth. Some of them 
possess  men  and  women.  But  some  especially  evil  demons  have  been  
locked up in the bottomless pit. They are released at the fifth trumpet 
and they come to earth and torture people for five months (9:5). Men will 
seek for death in those days but will not be able to die (9:6). Jesus once 
warned his disciples that if anyone did not forgive his brother from his 
heart,  God  would  hand  him  over  to  the  torturers  (Matthew  18:33–35). 
Those  torturers  are  demons.  That  was  not  an  empty  threat  that  Jesus  
made  but  something  that  would  actually  happen  to  every  believer  who  
does not forgive his brothers.
In 9:12–17, we read about the sixth trumpet. Four demons bound in 
the River Euphrates will be released then who will kill 200 million people. 

Silence in Heaven                                                                                                                                      993
Revelation
There will be a fierce war around Iraq (the River Euphrates goes through 
the middle of Iraq). This was written 2000 years ago, and we see today 
the fierce conflict going on around Iraq. The countries involved in this 
battle will have millions of soldiers in their armies, even though all those 
soldiers won’t be in the Middle East. Then in 9:20, we read that the rest 
of mankind still did not repent. It is only repentance that God is seeking 
for. And the reason why people are punished is only because they do not 
repent of their sins.
In 10:1–3, an angel comes down and cries out with a loud voice and 
then there are seven peals of thunder. John was about to write what the 
seven peals of thunder said when the Lord told him not to. So we don’t 
know what the seven peals of thunder said. What I learn from that is that 
there are some things that the Lord tells us that He does not want us to 
tell anyone else. It’s only meant for us personally. This is like a husband 
telling his wife a secret that he doesn’t want anyone else to hear. If you 
walk with the Lord, He will tell you some secrets that are meant only for 
you and for no-one else. You must not speak about them to anyone.
But  what  the  Lord  tells  you  to  write,  you  must  write.  The  Lord  told  
John, “Take the book which is in the angel’s hand and eat it. It will be 
as sweet as honey in your mouth, but it will make your stomach bitter” 
(10:8, 9). God’s Word does a double work – it encourages us, but also 
takes us through bitter experiences of trial and tribulation. In the new 
covenant, we have to experience both of these. Under the old covenant 
however,  when  Ezekiel  ate  a  similar  book,  it  was  only  sweet  (Ezekiel 
3:3). God give us “joy unspeakable and full of glory in the midst of many 
trials” (1 Peter 1:5–8).
Once John had eaten the book and had this twofold experience, then 
the Lord told him that he could prophesy. He could share his experience 
to others. There are certain things we can’t tell others and certain things 
we can.
Then we read about the days when the mystery of God would be finished 
(10:7). The seventh angel has sounded the last trumpet and the mystery 
is finished. The mystery of God is the church as the Bride of Christ (See 
Ephesians 5:31, 32). The great tribulation is over and the church is taken 
up into the skies at the last trumpet.
In 11:1, John was asked to measure the temple of God. God is meas-
uring His church – but only those “who worship in the Most Holy Place”. 
Those in the outer court are ignored (11:1, 2). 
Jerusalem  will  be  trampled  down  for  42  months  (1260  days)  (11:2). 
This  is  the  last-half  of  the  seven  years  of  tribulation.  The  Lord  gave  
Daniel a prophecy of a 490-year period (Daniel 9:24 – one day symbolising 
one year). Out of that period, 483 years would pass from the time King 
Cyrus commanded Jerusalem to be rebuilt up to the crucifixion of  Jesus 

994 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
(Daniel  9:25,  26).  (Note:  In  the  prophetic  calendar  –  in  Daniel  and  in  
Revelation – one year is counted as only 360 days. So 483 prophetic years 
of 360 days are equal to 476 solar years of 365 days. And it was exactly 476 
years from the time of the command to rebuild Jerusalem up to the cruci-
fixion of Jesus). The remaining 7 years of that period were carried forward 
to the end of time – and will be fulfilled in the 7-year-period of tribulation 
at the end of this age (Daniel 9:27). The second half of that 7-year- period 
is called “the great tribulation” – 1260 days, or 3½ years – the same period 
of time that Jesus exercised His public ministry. The Antichrist will dupli-
cate that and have lordship over the earth for 3½ years.
At that time there will be two witnesses (symbolically) for the Lord on 
earth (11:3, 4). Zechariah also saw a similar vision of two olive trees supply-
ing oil to a lampstand (Zechariah 4:11–13). These symbolised a two-fold 
prophetic ministry in the last days. When they speak, fire proceeds out of 
their mouth (symbolically speaking) to devour their enemies. They have 
power to stop the rain and to turn the rivers into blood (11:6). This minis-
try will be similar to the ministries of Moses and Elijah who did similar 
miracles. And finally, when they finish their ministry, they will be killed 
(11:7). That is a wonderful truth. A true servant of the Lord who walks in 
the will of God, cannot be killed until he has finished his earthly minis-
try. Nobody could kill these prophetic witnesses before God’s time – and 
no-one can kill you before that either.
These prophets will be publicly shamed. Their dead bodies will lie in 
the  street  of  Jerusalem  (11:8).  John  was  then  told  that  people  from  
all over the world would be able to see their dead bodies lying on the 
street for 3½ days (11:9). How can billions of people all over the world 
see  these  dead  bodies  lying  in  the  street  of  Jerusalem?  By  satellite  
television – which was unknown in John’s time. Here we see a hidden 
reference to the arrival of satellite television. The world will rejoice when 
these  Christian  prophets  are  killed.  The  world  (including  religious  
Christendom) has always rejoiced at the death of true prophets. But 
then a miracle will take place. After 3½ days, these two prophets will 
be raised from the dead. When they are raised up, a great fear comes 
upon everyone. They will then be taken up to heaven. Then there will 
be a great earthquake and one-tenth of the city will fall (11:11–13).
Jesus said in the last days there would be wars, famines and earth-
quakes  –  a  preparation  for  more  serious  calamities  to  come.  Then  the  
seventh angel sounds and there is a proclamation, “The kingdom of the 
world  has  become  the  kingdom  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  He  will  reign  
forever and ever” (11:15). The elders then fall down and worship God. 
We  saw  a  bird’s  eye  view  of  the  last  days  in  Chapter  6,  and  we  saw  
another one in Chapter 11. Now, more details of the last days are given 
again.

The Woman and the Dragon                                                                                                                   995
Revelation
The Woman and the Dragon
“A great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, the moon 
under  her  feet  and  on  her  head  a  crown  of  twelve  stars”  (12:1).  Joseph  
had a dream in which he saw the eleven stars (representing his 11 broth-
ers) bowing down to him. So when we compare Scripture with Scripture, 
it is clear that the 12 stars refer to the 12 tribes of Israel. So this woman 
symbolises Israel, and she brings forth a Child. That Child was Jesus, 
born in Israel.
Then  we  read  of  a  dragon  (the  devil)  who  long  ago  took  one  third  of  
the angels (“stars of heaven”) with him when he rebelled against God 
(12:4). All of them became demons. From this verse, we learn that, out 
of the millions of angels, one-third became demons. So, two-thirds of 
the angels remained faithful to God. Remember therefore that for every 
demon in the world there are two angels on our side!
The dragon waits in front of the woman (Israel) to swallow up the Child. 
That’s  what  Herod  tried  to  do  –  to  kill  the  Baby  Jesus.  But  he  didn’t  
succeed. The Child (Jesus) finally ascends to God and to His throne (12:5).
In 12:7–10, we read how Satan is cast down from the second heaven 
(“the  heavenly  places”  –  Ephesians  6:12).  Many  years  earlier,  he  was  
cast down from the third heaven (the immediate presence of God) to the 
second heaven. Now he is cast down from there to the earth. He is called 
here  the  “Deceiver  of  the  whole  world”  and  the  “Accuser  of  believers”. 
He accuses believers to God constantly – day and night (12:10). Anyone 
who accuses believers is joining hands with Satan. We can expose wrong 
doctrines in other believers and disagree with them. But we must never 
join Satan in accusing them.
In 12:11, we see three steps to overcome Satan. 
• First, by the blood of Jesus Christ. Satan’s accusations have no power 
at all against us, because the blood of Jesus has cleansed us from all 
our sins. When the devil accuses us of any sin that we committed in 
the recent past or in the ancient past, we must tell him with perfect 
faith, “The blood of Jesus has cleansed me from every sin. So there is 
no condemnation for me now.”
• Secondly, by “the word of our testimony.” We must tell Satan frequently 
that he was defeated on the cross by our Lord and therefore has no 
power over us, and so we are not afraid of him, and he cannot ever 
touch us without God’s permission. If we are bold to give this testi-
mony to Satan, we will overcome him constantly.
• Thirdly,  by  not  loving  our  self-life,  but  instead  putting  it  to  death  
(Galatians 5:24). Our self-life (our flesh) is Satan’s agent within us. If 
we consistently hate it and crucify it, Satan will lose his power over us.

996 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
In 12:13–16,  we  see  the  dragon  seeking  to  persecute  the  woman  (the  
Jewish remnant) because Jesus came forth from Israel. Throughout world 
history, there have been people who have tried to destroy the Jews. Haman 
tried  to  destroy  the  Jews  (in  Esther).  Hitler  tried  to  destroy  the  Jews  in  
the 20
th
 century. But they did not succeed. Today the Jews are living in 
the land of their fathers. We read that the earth helped the woman and 
protected her from the attacks of the dragon. When he could not succeed 
with Israel, the dragon went off to make war with the church that came 
forth from her (12:17). The first Christians were all Jews for many years. 
Here the church is called “those who keep the commandments of God and 
hold the testimony of Jesus.” That is the twofold mark of the true church.
Two Beasts
In 13:1,  we  see  a  beast  coming  out  of  the  sea  having  ten  horns.  This  
pictures  the  rise  of  the  Antichrist.  We  see  him  being  supported  by  the  
dragon.  People  worship  the  Antichrist.  By  subtle  deception,  he  tries  to  
imitate the resurrection of Christ (13:3). He is healed from a dangerous 
wound, and the whole world wonders how he could recover from such an 
injury. He didn’t actually die and he was never resurrected. Only Christ 
has been resurrected. But the Antichrist seeks to imitate that. He speaks 
arrogant words (13:5). He opens his mouth and blasphemes God (13:6). 
He  is  permitted  to  make  war  with  the  saints  and  to  kill  them  (“over-
come  their  bodies”  -  13:7).  The  devil  and  his  agents  may  overcome  our  
bodies and kill us. But he will not be able to overcome our spirits. We see 
here that many saints will be killed by the Antichrist in those days. That 
proves that in the days of the Antichrist there will be saints (believers) 
on earth. Here is yet another proof that the church will be here on earth 
during the time of the great tribulation. The overcomers (God’s spiritual 
commando troops) will be standing up for Him bravely in those days. He 
who wants to hear the truth, let him hear.
In 13:8, we read that all earth-dwellers (that is, those whose minds are 
set on the things of earth) will worship the Antichrist. But those whose 
names are written in the Book of Life will not worship Him. These are the 
overcomers whose minds are not set on the things of earth. Here is yet 
another statement that proves that believers will be here on earth, stand-
ing  up  against  the  Antichrist,  during  the  time  of  the  great  tribulation.  
With all these plain statements, it is surprising that there are still people 
who  believe  that  the  church  will  be  secretly  raptured  before  the  great  
tribulation. Once people have been brainwashed by preachers to believe 
a wrong teaching, it is difficult for most of them to change their minds, 
even when they see it plainly in Scripture. It requires humility, honesty 
and great boldness to do so.
Then  another  beast  comes  out  from  the  earth  to  join  the  Antichrist  
(13:11).  This  is  the  false  prophet.  This  completes  the  Satanic  trinity  of  

Two Beasts                                                                                                                                                 997
Revelation
Satan  (the  master),  the  Antichrist  (the  political  leader)  and  the  False  
prophet  (the  religious  leader).  This  combination  of  religion,  politics  
and  Satan  join  together  to  persecute  the  church.  This  new  beast  has  
horns  like  a  lamb.  He  pretends  to  be  a  follower  of  Christ.  This  could  
be a religious leader who persecutes the true believers of Jesus Christ. 
History tells us of many leaders in Christendom (both Roman Catholic 
and Protestant) who have persecuted the true followers of Christ in past 
centuries, and who do so even today. So it won’t be surprising if another 
so-called  “Christian”  leader  teams  up  with  the  Antichrist  to  persecute  
God’s people. He has horns like a lamb, but he speaks like a dragon. He 
is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. He has the support of the political power, 
the  Antichrist,  and  he  performs  deceiving  signs  to  fool  people.  He  is  a  
magician and a hypnotist, and he does false miracles to deceive simple-
minded people who are ignorant of God’s Word (13:13, 14).
He also makes an image of the political leader and makes that image to 
speak, thus deceiving people. This will be a computerised robot made to 
look exactly like a human being and from which a recorded voice comes 
forth. The mouth is made to move along with the speech in a very realistic 
way – and many are deceived. I have seen such robots in some museums. 
Then  the  false  prophet  makes  all  the  people  in  the  world  to  receive  
a  mark.  It’s  called  “the  mark  of  the  beast”.  This  mark  can  be  taken  by  
people either on their forehead or on their right hands (13:16). If it inside 
their palm, they can hide it from others. But if it is on their forehead then 
everyone can see it. That means that the devil gives people the option to be 
either open followers of his (having his mark on their foreheads) or secret 
followers (having his mark hidden in the palms of their hands). There are 
those  who  openly  follow  Satan  today.  And  then  there  are  others  (even  
in  Christian  churches)  who  secretly  follow  Satan  –  they  live  in  sexual  
sin in secret, they give bribes with their hands in secret, and then come 
and break bread as holy people in the church with the same hands. The 
devil gives people that option to keep up their “good” reputation in their 
churches and to follow him in their private lives. Satan offered Jesus all 
the  things  in  this  world  if  He  would  bow  down  to  him.  Christians  who  
secretly follow Satan can get many things in this world, and yet nobody 
in the church may ever know the wrong things they do in their private 
lives – because “the mark of the beast” is hidden in their hands. But one 
day everything will be revealed.
The number of the Antichrist is mentioned as 666 (13:18). What does 
this  mean?  The  word  ‘Jesus’  in  Greek  is  written  as  ‘IESOUS’.  Unlike  
English,  each  Greek  alphabet  has  a  numeric  value.  The  total  numeric  
value of I,E,S,O,U,S in Greek is 888. 8 is the number of the new crea-
tion. The 8
th
 day of the week is the beginning of a new week. In a piano 
keyboard, the 8
th
 note is the beginning of a new octave. And Jesus is the 
Beginner of a new creation. A triple 8 refers to the Trinity. So this number 
symbolises Jesus as God who is also a Man and the Beginner of the new

Revelation
creation. Now look at 666. 6 is the number of man, for man was created 
on  the  6
th
  day.  A  triple  6  refers  to  the  Trinity.  So  666  symbolises  man  
seeking to be God. That is what the Antichrist does. “The man of sin who 
opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god and takes his seat 
in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God” (2 Thessalonians 
2:4).  One  day  when  we  know  who  the  Antichrist  is,  if  you  check  the  
numeric value of his name in Greek, you will find that it totals 666.
The Followers of Jesus
In 14:1–5,  we  read  of  the  followers  of  Jesus.  But  notice  the  difference  
between them and the followers of the Antichrist. The followers of Jesus 
are not  given  the  option  to  have  the  mark  on  their  hands.  It  has  to  be  
only on their foreheads. In other words, you cannot be a secret follower 
of Jesus. You have to be an open follower of Jesus, or not be a follower 
of His at all. You can be a secret follower of Satan, but not of Jesus. The 
144,000  mentioned  here  is  again  a  symbolic  number.  This  number  is  
very small compared to the great multitude that cannot be numbered – 
mentioned in Chapter 7. This shows us that among the great multitude 
of  those  whose  sins  are  forgiven,  there  are  very,  very  few  who  actually  
follow the Lord wherever He goes (14:4). The way to life, as Jesus said, is 
very narrow and very few find it (Matthew 7:14). Very few choose the way 
of the cross.
This small group also sings a new song, a song of devotion to Christ, 
which they have learned here on earth before they go to heaven (14:3). 
You can’t learn this song of devotion to Jesus after going to heaven. It 
has to be learnt here on earth. It also says about this group, that no lie 
was found in their mouth (14:5). So, to be in this group, one has to get 
rid of all lying, all pretence and all hypocrisy from their lives. These are 
the  true  followers  of  Jesus,  the  Bride  of  Jesus  Christ.  They  have  been  
“purchased  from  the  earth”  (14:3),  meaning  that  they  have  been  freed  
from attachment to this earth. It also says about them that they “have 
not been defiled with women, but have kept themselves pure” (14:4). This 
refers to their having kept themselves from the harlot Babylon – worldly 
Christianity (that we read more of in Chapters 17 and 18).
In 14:7–11,  we  read  of  three  angels  proclaiming  three  messages  of  
judgement. The first one says, “Fear God and give Him glory because the 
hour of His judgement has come.” The second one says, “Fallen, fallen is 
Babylon the great.” And the third one says, “If anyone follows the beast, 
he will be tormented forever.” 
In 4:14–20, we read of the harvest of judgement as the Lord uses His 
sickle.  An  angel  says,  “Put  in  your  sickle  and  reap,  for  the  hour  to  reap  
has  come,  because  the  harvest  of  the  earth  is  ripe”  (14:15).  This  is  not 
the  harvest  of  souls  who  need  to  be  saved.  That  harvest  was  ripe  2000  
years ago, when Jesus said to his disciples, “Lift up your eyes and look. 

The Bride of Christ                                                                                                                                    999
Revelation
The   fields are ripe for harvest” (John 4:35). But what we see here is another 
harvest – a harvest of God’s judgement on the world at the end of this age.
The Bride of Christ
In Chapter  15,  we  see  another  picture  of  the  Bride  of  Christ  (15:2).  She  
stands victorious here on a sea of glass mixed with fire. A sea of glass is 
a picture of a life of perfect rest. “The wicked are like the troubled sea that 
cannot rest” (Isaiah 57:20). What we see here is the very opposite of that. 
Here are believers who have entered into “the Sabbath rest in Christ” in their 
lives (Hebrews 4:9–11). They sing the song of Moses. There are two songs of 
Moses – one in Exodus 15:1–4 and the other in Deuteronomy 32:1–44. The 
theme in both those songs is the same: “God Himself has taken vengeance 
on our enemies”. We didn’t do it. God did it. Praise the Lord!
In Chapter 16, we read of seven bowls of wrath that are poured out on 
the earth. All that is described in this chapter could take place in a very 
short time. The wrath of God is mentioned in Revelation, only here – in 
Chapters 14 to 16 – towards the end of the time of tribulation (a preview 
of this is mentioned in 6:16, 17). That wrath will never touch a believer, 
for we have been saved from God’s wrath. The Lord’s return is suddenly 
mentioned in the middle of this chapter (16:15). The church is raptured, 
God’s  wrath  is  poured  out  upon  the  earth  and  Christ  comes  down  to  
earth with His church to reign on the earth (19:11). 
When the seventh bowl is poured out, various calamities hit the earth 
and  the  short-lived  battle  of  Armageddon  takes  place  and  Babylon  is  
ready to be judged. What Babylon stands for is described in the next two 
chapters.
Babylon and Spiritual Harlotry
Chapters 17 and 18 are about Babylon – which is both a religious system 
and  a  political  system.  It  symbolises  corrupt  Christendom  which  has  
the same spirit as the corrupt political parties in the world. Babylonian 
Christianity seeks for earthly power as well as for God’s power. But since 
God’s  power  cannot  be  mixed  with  earthly  honour  and  power,  Satan  
deceives Christendom with counterfeits of God’s power – as we see being 
exercised by the great multitude of Babylonian preachers today. Jesus 
however said, “My kingdom is not of this world”. You can’t be a disciple 
of Jesus and have the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of this world. 
But Babylonian Christianity says you can. So Babylonian Christians seek 
to get all they can of this world while professedly seeking the kingdom of 
God first. But they will discover in the final day that Satan deceived them 
and they do not get the kingdom of heaven at all.
In Chapter 17, we see a woman riding on the beast. The beast is the 
world’s political system, and the woman is religious Christendom – and 

1000 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
they  are  hand  in  glove  with  each  other.  In  17:5,  we  read  of  ‘Babylon 
the  great.’  Babylon  is  called  ‘great’  11  times  in  the  book  of  Revelation. 
Jerusalem however is called the ‘holy’ city (Revelation 21:2). The contrast 
between  ‘great’  and  ‘holy’  is  the  contrast  between  quantity  and  quality. 
The  essential  difference  between  Babylon  and  Jerusalem  is  one  of  
quality.  Do  you  seek  to  be  great  or  holy?  That  will  determine  whether  
you build Babylon or Jerusalem. Even if your doctrines are all evangeli-
cal, if you seek to be great in the world or in Christendom, you will only 
build Babylon.  If  however  your  passion  is  holiness,  then  you  won’t  be  
great, but you will build Jerusalem. This is the choice that faces those 
in Christian work today: Shall we seek for number or for quality. If we 
lower our standards, we can always gather more people. But we will lead 
all of them to hell. Noah had only 8 people in his church after 120 years 
of  ministry,  because  he  was  “a  preacher  of  righteousness”  who  never  
lowered his standards (2 Peter 2:5). If he had lowered his standards, he 
could  have  got  800  or  even  8000  people  in  his  group.  But  all  of  them,  
including Noah, would have been drowned in the flood. Nobody would 
have been saved. Thank God Noah emphasised quality and never sought 
for  numbers.  As  a  result  he  saved  all  eight  of  them.  If  you  make  mere  
converts  to  Christianity  but  do  not  make  them  disciples  of  Jesus,  you  
may  have  large  numbers.  But  they  will  be  a  part  of  Babylon  that  will  
finally be destroyed by God.
I  have  found  this  Babylonian  spirit  in  at  least  some  Christians  in  
every  single  Christian  group.  No  denomination  or  church  is  excluded.  
A church-leader has to fight a constant battle if he is to keep this spirit 
out of his church. The spirit of compromise and worldliness and seeking 
the  honour  and  wealth  of  this  world  comes  into  Christians  so  easily.  
Then one cannot be a disciple of Jesus. If you seek to please men, you 
cannot please God. You cannot escape this spirit of Babylon by leaving 
one church and joining another. Many Protestants and Pentecostals say 
that the Roman Catholic Church is Babylon. But the spirit of Babylon is 
found among Protestants and Pentecostals too – and among their leaders 
especially. They run after money much more than the Roman Catholic 
priests do.
Babylon is not a particular group or a particular denomination. It is 
a system. Like Satan’s world system, it penetrates and permeates every 
Christian group. You can sit in the holiest church in the world and be a 
member of Babylon. It is a spirit that mixes Christ with money, Christ 
with comfort and heaven with the world. But these are all opposites and 
like oil and water, they do not mix. The only way to escape the spirit of 
Babylon is by putting your flesh to death consistently and getting rid of 
the spirit of the world from your life.
In Chapter 18, we see Babylon as an economic system. The Christian 
religion has become a great means of making money for many people. In 
Jesus’  time,  the  worldly  Jews  sold  doves  and  sheep  in  the  temple,  not  

Babylon and Spiritual Harlotry                                                                                                             1001
Revelation
to serve the people, but to make profit for themselves. Whenever you do 
Christian work for personal profit and without personal sacrifice, you are 
moving in the spirit of Babylon. Many preachers in Christendom today 
write  books  and  make  videos  and  earn  huge  royalties  for  themselves.  
They  minister  in  the  Lord’s  name  to  make  money  for  themselves.  This  
is the spirit of Babylon. Think of Christmas celebrations. What a lot of 
money shopkeepers make from selling Christmas cards and gifts!
The  true  prophets  of  God  will  stand  against  this  corrupt  system,  
declaring that this is not the way the apostles served the Lord. The New 
Testament does teach that those who serve the Lord can receive gifts 
from others who give them gifts voluntarily. But if you are in Christian 
work and you are earning more through your ministry than you would 
have earned if you were working in a secular job, then you are influ-
enced by the spirit of Babylon. Many Christian workers are earning five 
to ten times what they would have earned if they had been in a secular 
job. They are not serving the Lord. They are serving themselves. Many 
preachers and pastors are furious with me for exposing all this. But 
the priests in the temple hated Jesus also, for exposing those who were 
making money in the name of God. So it is quite all right if people hate 
me too, for the same reasons.
All  those  who  go  along  this  way  will  have  tremendous  regret  in  the  
final day. The way of God is the way of sacrifice. Jerusalem is a city of 
sacrifice. If you went to the temple in ancient Jerusalem you would see 
blood all over the outer court. It is a place of sacrifice. Babylon however is 
a place of business. To follow Jesus and to serve Him is to go the way of 
sacrifice, not the way of personal gain of money or honour. One day this 
economic religious system will be destroyed by God along with all those 
who  built  and  supported  it.  So  the  Lord  calls  His  people  today  saying,  
“Come out of Babylon, my people. Do not take part in her sins, or you will 
be punished along with her. For her sins are piled as high as heaven, and 
God is ready to judge her for her crimes” (Revelation 18:4, 5 - Living).
In Chapter19,  we  read  the  word  ‘Hallelujah’  occurring  for  the  first 
time  in  the  New  Testament.  There  are  only  4  occurrences  of  the  word  
in the New Testament – and all 4 are in this chapter. Today many say 
“Hallelujah”  meaninglessly.  But  in  heaven  they  say  “Hallelujah”  with  a  
reason. Three times they shout “Hallelujah”, because Babylon has been 
destroyed! (19:1–4). Will you also join them today and say, “Hallelujah! 
Lord,  You  are  going  to  destroy  this  wretched  money-making,  pleasure-  
loving Christianity that has led so many people astray”?
The fourth time they say “Hallelujah” is because “the Lord God is reign-
ing and the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself 
ready” (19:6, 7). This is yet another thing we must shout Hallelujah for, 
that the Lord is preparing the Bride of Christ in purity on earth today. 

1002 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
The Bride of Christ comprises of those who have kept themselves pure 
from the spirit of Babylon. She is clothed in pure, white linen, without 
any  gold,  symbolising  the  righteous  life  that  those  believers  lived.  This  
is  not  the  righteousness  of  Christ  but  “the  righteous  acts  of  the  saints” 
(Revelation 19:8). This pure white dress is in contrast to the gaudy dress 
of  the  harlot,  who  is  decked  in  purple  and  scarlet  with  gold,  precious  
stones and pearls (17:4).
John was so excited when he saw the Bride of Christ that he fell down 
to  worship  the  angel.  But  the  angel  said,  “Don’t  worship  me,  worship  
God” (19:10).
Then  we  see  Christ  returning  to  earth,  as  a  warrior,  along  with  the  
saints  who  had  just  been  raptured  to  meet  Him  in  the  air  to  welcome  
Him to earth (19:11–16). He is coming to establish His kingdom. There is 
a brief description of the battle of Armageddon here (19:17–21). Then the 
Antichrist and the false prophet are taken and thrown into the lake of 
fire (19:20). They are the first two occupants of the lake of fire. The lake 
of fire is a bigger version of hell.
The Thousand-Year Reign
In Chapter 20, we read of Satan being bound in the bottomless pit for 
1000 years when Jesus reigns on the earth. In those days this proph-
ecy will be fulfilled: “The wolf and the lamb will lie down together, and 
the leopard and goats will be at peace. Calves and fat cattle will be safe 
among  lions;  and  lions  will  eat  grass  like  the  cows.  Babies  will  crawl  
safely among poisonous snakes, for as the waters fill the sea, so shall 
the earth be full of the knowledge of the Lord” (Isaiah 11:6–9 - Living). 
During those 1000 years, those who were faithful on earth will reign 
with Christ. 
Here is a brief history of Satan. He was originally cast down from the 
third  heaven  to  the  second  heaven  when  he  rebelled  against  God.  One  
day  he  will  be  thrown  down  from  the  second  heaven  to  earth  (as  we  
saw in Chapter 12). Here we see him being cast from the earth into the 
bottomless pit. After 1000 years, he will be released for a short while and 
then he will be thrown into the lake of fire. That will be his final end.
We also read here about the first resurrection – the resurrection of the 
righteous (20:6). The wicked will not be raised for their judgement until 
the 1000-year reign of Christ is over. At the end of 1000 years Satan will 
be released for a short period just to show people that even after people 
have seen the peaceful reign of Jesus for 1000 years, they still want to 
follow Satan, because men are selfish, self-centred and do not want to 
submit their lives to God. But in a moment, the fire of God comes down 
and burns them all up and then the devil is thrown into the lake of fire 
(20:9, 10).

The New Jerusalem                                                                                                                                1003
Revelation
Then  comes  the  second  resurrection,  when  God  will  sit  on  the  great  
throne of judgement and unbelievers from all the ages will be raised 
from the dead to stand before Him. The records of their lives will then 
be opened (20:11,  12). When Revelation was written, books were not 
like  the  books  we  have  today.  They  were  rolled-up  scrolls  of  parch-
ment. The nearest to that, that we see today, is a video-tape which is 
also rolled up like a scroll. So God takes the video tape of each one’s 
memory  and  “presses  the  rewind  button”.  The  person’s  memory  goes  
back to the time when he was born and his life is played back from there 
– for the whole world to see. Everything that he said and did, all the 
lies he ever said, all the filthy books he ever read, all his secret sins, all 
his thoughts, his attitudes towards others and his motives, everything, 
will be on display on the screen for the world to see. Everyone will then 
see for themselves that that person deserves to go to the lake of fire. 
These people were already in hell. Why were they raised up to be cast 
into the lake of fire? It was so that the whole world may see the right-
eousness of God’s judgements – that everyone who is cast into the lake 
of fire deserves to go there. Judgement must not only be done, but also 
seen to be done.
We all have a video-tape running in our memory that will be exposed 
before the world one day – for believers at the judgement seat of Christ 
(2  Corinthians  5:10), and  for  unbelievers  at  the  great-white-throne  
judgement described here. There is only one way for all our sins to be 
blotted out from that video tape. By an honest confession of our guilt, a 
genuine repentance and turning away from that sin and asking Christ 
to cleanse us with His blood from all sin. Then that part of the video 
tape will be wiped out and be blank. That does not mean that we can 
take sin lightly, just because it is easily cleansed. Even if our sins are 
wiped out from the tape, it will still be embarrassing for us in the final 
day when people see a lot of blank spaces in the tape of our memory!!
The New Jerusalem
In Chapters 21 and 22, we read about the new Jerusalem and the new 
heavens and the new earth. Here in the new Jerusalem, the overcomers 
will inherit everything (21:7). In 21:8, we see a brief list of those who are 
sent into the lake of fire. Notice there that the cowards are listed first. 
These are the ones who feared men more than God and who cared for the 
approval of men more than for the approval of God and who therefore did 
not have the courage to stand up for the truth.
The new Jerusalem is made of crystal-clear material (21:10, 11). This 
symbolises the importance of being transparent and totally free from all 
hypocrisy if we are to be a part of this glorious church. This is also symbol-
ised in 21:16, where we are told that “the length, width and height of the 

1004 Through the Bible: The Final Triumph
Revelation
city are all equal”. It is a cube. Its depth is exactly the same as its front-
face (length and width). So seek with all your heart to be  crystal-clear in 
your life at all times and to have as much spiritual depth in your life as 
others see on your outside. In other words, live in such a way that your 
private life is not in any way different from what you are in public.
In 21:12 and 14, we read about the 12 tribes of Israel as well as the 12 
apostles of Christ. This seems to indicate that the Old Testament saints 
and New Testament believers will both have a part in this new Jerusalem.
Then in 22:1, 2, we see the river of life, the tree of life, and the throne of 
God and of Christ. There will no longer be any curse anywhere (22:3). The 
tree of knowledge of good and evil has been destroyed. There is no more 
need for the light of the sun for God Himself is the light there (22:5). This 
is a picture of our eternal home. Then Jesus says, “I am coming quickly. 
Be ready. Blessed is the man who obeys the words of this book” (22:7).
John is so excited that he falls down to worship the angel once again. 
John makes this mistake a second time. But the angel again tells him to 
“worship God” (22:8, 9).
In 22:11, we see an amazing exhortation: “Let the one who does wrong 
still do wrong, and let the one who is filthy still be filthy.”  Can  you  
imagine that the Bible concludes in its last page with an exhortation to 
continue to do wrong and to be filthy!! What that means is that if you 
have read the whole Bible and come to the last page and you still want 
to do wrong and be filthy, then God tells you to go ahead and do wrong 
and be filthy – for there is no more hope for you then.
We  are  now  living  in  the  last  days.  The  Lord  is  coming  soon  and  He  
will give to every man according to what he has done (22:12). In 22:15, 
is  a  final  warning  against  lying  –  by  word  or  by  deed. The  first  sin 
mentioned in the Bible is lying when Satan told Eve that she would “not 
die” (Genesis 3:4). The last sin mentioned in the Bible here, is also lying. 
That shows us the seriousness of all lying and hypocrisy. The Bride of 
Christ consists of those who have cleansed themselves from this habit of 
lying (Revelation 14:5).
A final invitation is given before the Bible closes, to all who are thirsty 
for the divine life to come and partake of eternal life freely (22:17). There 
are  two  invitations  in  Revelation: Unbelievers  are  invited  to  be  saved. 
Believers are urged to overcome.
A final warning is also given to anyone who removes or modifies any of 
the commandments given in this book (22:18, 19).
The Bible concludes with the words of Jesus promising to come back 
to earth (22:20) and the words of the apostle John: “The grace of our 
Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints. Amen” (22:21). The last word in 
the Old Testament is ‘curse’ (Malachi 4:6). And the last sentence in the 

The New Jerusalem                                                                                                                                1005
Revelation
New Testament is about “grace”. There we see the difference between 
the old covenant and the new covenant.
Thus we come to the end of the Bible. Because we have seen the end 
of the Bible we know where Satan will finally be – in the lake of fire. And 
so if Satan ever accuses you or troubles you, tell him boldly, “I have read 
the last chapter and I know what your end is going to be.” “When the devil 
reminds you of your past, you remind him of his future!”
We also know where we will finally be – eternally with our heavenly 
Father and Jesus and the saints and angels in heaven. This should give 
us great confidence at all times. 
Let  me  conclude  with  an  illustration.  Suppose  there  was  a  cricket  
match  between  your  country  and  another  country  and  you  watched  
it  on  television  and  you  saw  that  your  country’s  team  won  the  match.  
A  friend  of  yours,  who  did  not  see  the  match  and  does  not  know  the  
result, watches a replay of that match on television a few hours later. You 
sit with him and watch the match too. During the replay, at times when 
your team is doing badly, your friend is tense and wonders whether your 
team will lose. But you are totally relaxed, because you already know the 
final result.
Apply  that  to  our  battle  with  Satan.  There  you  can  see  the  reason  
why some believers are tense, discouraged and worried frequently and 
why other believers are at rest. The latter ones have already seen the 
end-result.  They  have  read  and  believed  what  it  says  in  Revelation, 
that Satan has already been defeated on the cross and will be cast into 
the lake of fire finally. Jesus and the saints are triumphant in the end. 
So they know that even if Satan wins a few battles here and there, at 
present, he has already lost the war. Praise the Lord.

Zac Poonen was formerly an officer in the Indian Navy, who has been
